        "content": "Pamela Bach, the former Baywatch actress and ex-wife of David Hasselhoff, has died aged 62. Bach was found at home in the Hollywood Hills on 5 March after she died by suicide, said the Los Angeles Medical Examiner's office. She met Hasselhoff while acting with him on the set of TV series Knight Rider, and the two married in 1989. She went on to star alongside him on lifeguard TV drama Baywatch before their divorce in 2006.  \"Our family is deeply saddened by the recent passing of Pamela Hasselhoff,\"  Hasselhoff said in a statement.  \"We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support during this difficult time but we kindly request privacy as we grieve and navigate through this challenging time.\" Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bach began acting in the 1970s. She and Hasselhoff have two daughters together.  Her acting credits included soap opera The Young and the Restless, Cheers, The Fall Guy, T.J. Hooker, Superboy and Viper. Her daughter, Hayley Amber Hasselhoff, posted a photo of her parents on Instagram, with a white star, in apparent tribute to her mother. In Bach's last Instagram post, published on New Year's Eve, she wrote about being excited to welcome 2025. She said she was also excited to watch her granddaughter, London, \"grow and seeing her smile light up my world is truly the greatest blessing\". \"May 2025 be filled with beautiful moments, laughter, and all the blessings your hearts can hold,\" she continued.  \"Here's to a year of making cherished memories, spreading joy, and embracing every precious moment!\" Bach's representative, Sharon Kelly, told TMZ she was shocked by her death. \"My heart goes out to her family, her beautiful daughters and granddaughter who Pamela constantly gushes about and loves so dearly,\" she said.

It is the first time the 88-year-old has been heard by the public since entering hospital to be treated for bronchitis, before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.  The short, two-line message, recorded earlier that day from Rome's Gemelli Hospital, was played during a nightly prayer service for the pope in St Peter's Square at the Vatican.  Earlier this week the Vatican said the Pontiff was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure and had been using \"non-invasive mechanical ventilation\", but is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. The Pope has been forced to cancel a number events since his hospitalisation, most recently on Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of the six-week period leading up to Easter.

        "title": "Gene found to link obesity risk in labradors and humans",
        "content": "The gene the researchers identified interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite Dogs that are constantly hungry and prone to being overweight share a common bit of biology with some obesity-prone humans.   This is what UK scientists have discovered - identifying a genetic source of many labradors' - and some people's - tendency to overeat. Researchers found that changes in a particular gene, one of the building blocks of biological code that produces the blueprint for how our bodies work, alters the chemical signals that tell our brains we've had enough to eat. The scientists say their findings, published in the journal Science, external, reveal something \"powerful\" about the biology of obesity risk. \"By studying dogs, we've honed in on some interesting new biology here,\" explained lead researcher Dr Eleanor Raffan from the University of Cambridge's department of physiology, development and neuroscience.  She added that the discovery showed that \"owners of slim dogs are not morally superior - and the same is true of slim people\".   \"If you have a high genetic risk of obesity, you're prone to gaining weight unless you put a huge effort into not doing so. And those with low genetic risk just don't have to work so hard.\" This canine-human biological link came from the researchers' examination of the genetics of 250 labradors. The team looked for pieces of genetic code that were common in overweight dogs.  They picked out one gene in particular - called DENND1B - that was associated with a higher body mass in the labradors. And when they searched through a library of genetic information from thousands of humans, they discovered that the same gene was associated with a higher body mass in people, too.  Before this study of labrador genetics, Dr Raffan said, \"no one suspected that gene  had anything to do with obesity\". Dogs with this genetic predisposition need a strict diet and regime of exercise The gene interferes with a brain signalling pathway that helps regulate our appetite.  Dr Raffan explained: \"It alters the predisposition to weight gain because it's tweaking a system that is involved in regulating how hungry we feel and how much energy we burn off.\" The findings could help in the future development of new drugs to tackle obesity. But the scientists say they reveal how much harder people - and owners of dogs - with this genetic predisposition have to work to offset its effects. Another member of the research team, Alyce McClellan, from Cambridge University  added that the results emphasised \"the importance of fundamental brain pathways in controlling appetite and body weight\".  Weight loss drugs may boost health in many ways Why fat labradors can blame their genes The discovery adds to a developing picture of those pathways and the biological driving forces behind overeating.  A group of weight loss drugs, that includes Ozempic, target some of this biology, and have exploded in popularity in recent years.  What we've identified here is a different pathway [from the one targeted by those drugs],\" explained Dr Raffan.  \"But it all speaks to the same important bit of biology, which is that obesity is not  about having low willpower.  \"It's about the fact that some people are prone to weight gain because they have a genetic risk which increases their responsiveness to food and their appetite.  \"This goes for dogs and humans alike -  they have a genetic drive to overeat.\" Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "William sees how text messages can save young lives",
        "content": "A support service that lets young people text for help when they're in an emergency mental health crisis has now had three million conversations, with 2,000 messages arriving each day. The Prince of Wales visited the project in west London which provides 24/7 free text message support for young people with problems, including suicidal thoughts, but who would be unlikely to pick up a phone to talk. The Shout service responds to emergency messages seeking help, which might come in emojis and text speak, and often late at night. Among the volunteers staffing this service, designed to be accessible for a digital generation, is Ben West, whose brother Sam took his own life in 2018. Ben West says he wishes the text service had been available for his brother \"How amazing is it, from my point of view, after what Sam went through and losing Sam, to be able to sit there and tell someone texting they're not on their own any more,\" said Ben. \"We're going to come up with a plan together, and we can spend some time chatting and we can get you to a place where you're more in control. \"I've had conversations where people have told me something they've never told anybody else before in their lives. It's a privilege to be on the other end of that,\" said Ben, one of 2,000 current volunteers responding to texts to \"Shout 85258\". Prince William met Ben and other young advisers to the project, hearing about helping young people who might have been reluctant to try other mental health services.  \"Young people much prefer to talk via text, it's become their language anyway... they find it much more accessible and much less intimidating to text someone than speak on the phone,\" said Ben. Ben West shows a training system for volunteers to Prince William The Shout helpline was launched in 2018 by Mental Health Innovations, a charity set up by the Royal Foundation, reflecting the prince's longstanding interest in mental health, having helped set up the Heads Together project. Prince William was himself a volunteer on the text helpline, after receiving training, during the Covid pandemic, saying his first shift was \"terrifying\". \"Some of those conversations lived with me for quite a long time afterwards, and you always say to yourself, 'Did I give enough, did I do enough, did I find the right answer?'\" said Prince William. \"It's more than just a text line, it's life saving,\" said the prince. He was told that on 35,000 occasions emergency services had intervened directly when people getting in touch seemed to be in imminent danger. The text message helpline makes it easier for those already struggling to share their feelings. \"Sam, my brother, was really embarrassed about his diagnosis of depression, for him it felt like a flaw and something to hide,\" said Ben, who since his brother's suicide has campaigned to improve mental health services. There are other at-risk groups who can also use the service, who might otherwise be reluctant to speak about their feelings, including middle-aged men. Victoria Hornby said that younger age groups were increasingly in need of help Victoria Hornby, chief executive of Mental Health Innovations, said there has been an increase in the \"severity\" of the problems faced by those seeking help, since the scheme was first launched in 2018. The percentage of messages from people with suicidal thoughts has risen from 25% to 37%, she said, Among the other reasons for getting in touch was about low mood, stress, relationship problems, self-harming, loneliness and issues such as body image or tensions about sexuality. There has also been a significant increase in calls for help from a younger age group, those aged 13 and under, which she said seemed to be part of a growing sense of anxiety and pressure on children's lives. Sunday night is the single busiest time for calls, she said, reflecting the pressures people feel before going into the new week, whether at school, college or work. It's a moment when a text message exchange, away from other people, can be the way to get help, she said: \"You can't be overheard. For some people having to say out loud things that are incredibly difficult, that can stop people from reaching for help.\" The text helpline is merging with another support service aimed at young people, the Mix, and there is an aim for a wider range of support services, including peer-to-peer mentoring and counselling. Prince William spoke of the importance of support after that initial contact and education services to help people before their problems are too overwhelming. \"Prevention is really important, before things go spiralling down,\" he said. A report into the project by Imperial College London said such digital services could help tackle the waiting times for help with mental health problems, with 1.5 million waiting for treatment, including 100,000 children and young people. The report said that two thirds of those who had got in touch with Shout had felt calmer from the exchange.  \"We've saved lives. It's an amazing feeling. I just wish this service existed when Sam needed it, someone like me, to talk to. Had that existed then who knows what might have happened,\" said Ben.

        "title": "Trump pauses some Canada and Mexico tariffs until next month",
        "content": "Some of the sweeping tariffs imposed on Mexican and Canadian goods imported to the United States will be suspended until next month, President Donald Trump says The one-month exemption includes goods covered under the USMCA trade agreement negotiated during Trump's first term The US enacted sweeping 25% tariffs on its North American neighbours earlier this week after previously delaying them for a month Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says a recent call with Trump was \"colourful\", adding that Ottawa \"will continue to be in a trade war... for the foreseeable future\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meanwhile, calls Trudeau a \"numbskull\" and warns his approach on tariffs could lead to them being raised  Trump has said he wants to use tariffs to protect US jobs and manufacturing, and to prevent illegal migration and drug trafficking This video can not be played Trump signs order pausing some Mexico and Canada tariffs Edited by Caitlin Wilson and Alex Smith in Washington DC Will GrantBBC Mexico correspondent One\nof the biggest questions thrown up by this latest postponement on tariffs is\nwhether it is merely another temporary stay of execution, or if it could lead to a\nmore permanent cancellation of the threat. On\nthe one hand, Trump is unlikely to relinquish a tool he considers extremely\neffective, even if economists question the wisdom of that policy.  At the\nvery least, his supporters claim, threatening tariffs helps to bring people to\nthe negotiating table on issues they might otherwise have been happy to\nignore. However,\nhe runs  a danger of becoming the boy who cried wolf on tariffs in North\nAmerica. It does no favours for the American, Mexican or Canadian economies to have this\nuncertainty hanging over them, and in due course a more robust and reliable\ntrading relationship will surely be in everyone's interest. The\nregional free trade agreement between the three countries - USMCA - is due for renegotiation next year, and it\nwill be interesting to see if the neighbours have established a more\nnormal working relationship by then. Certainly a month-to-month threat of\ntariffs followed by last-minute cancellations doesn't seem sustainable. We're ending our live coverage of today's tariff changes for now, but you can stay up-to-date on the latest here: Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs Some of the sweeping 25% tariffs which US President Donald Trump imposed on Mexico and Canada just a few days ago will now be suspended until next month - here's what we know so far about today's changes: Stock markets across the world have witnessed a roller-coaster ride over the last few days as investors grappled with the uncertainty around US President Donald Trump's announcement and rollback of tariffs. The US dollar has weakened and stocks have slid. Tech shares stumbled, and recession-fears continued to weigh on financial stocks. The uncertainty continued on Thursday, when Trump announced the suspension of some tariffs on Mexico and Canada. All three major US stock indices closed down on Thursday. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78%, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. Investors are unnerved by the day-to-day changes in the White House's tariff policy, with delays and exemptions on the table, the Wall Street Journal reported. \"Much will depend on whether these new tariffs prove temporary or are toned down,\" strategists at BNP Paribas told the Associated Press. \"But even if they are ultimately removed, we anticipate lasting damage to global economic activity.\" Trump on Thursday blamed \"globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well\" for the stock market slide of recent days.  \"I'm not even looking at the market because long-term the United States will be very strong with what's happening here,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick too reinforced the message. \"The president wants American growth and American prosperity, okay? And the fact that the stock market goes down half a percent or percent, it goes up half a percent or percent, that is not the driving force of our outcomes,\" Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter The tariffs imposed earlier this week - and then partially repealed today - from the Trump administration on China, Mexico and Canada will hit trade from countries that supplied more than 40% of the nearly $3.3tn worth of imports into the US last year. If they are fully brought back into force, the fees could, in theory, raise more than $141bn in 2025 and more than $1.4tn over 10 years, according to estimates by the Tax Foundation. But that doesnât mean the US would actually collect that much new revenue. The forecast doesn't, for example, include the cost of potential retaliation, which could reduce tax collections from businesses or workers that are hurt. As for what the government might do with the money? Trump has promised to extend tax cuts from his first term â and make further cuts. He has even floated the idea of replacing America's income tax with tariffs. But the US is set to spend $7tn in 2025 and is already facing a budget gap of $1.9tn, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. The potential tariff revenue represents a tiny drop in that bucket. Dharshini DavidChief economics correspondent Forecasts are always uncertain at the best of times. Much will depend on when and if these newly exempt tariffs come back into force, how long the still-in-place ones last, which other countries they spread to, what retaliatory actions are taken and how businesses and consumers react. How much of the tariffs will businesses pass on to consumers, for example? Will consumers change their buying patterns? There is much uncertainty â in an environment President Trump has engineered to be uncertain. But what we do know is this: history tells us that trade wars push up prices and squeeze prosperity. So for now, economists expect an escalating trade war would dull growth on average globally as targeted countries suffer. Canada \"will not proceed with the second wave of tariffs\" on billions of US goods, the country's finance minister says, after the US announced it was pausing the implementation of some tariffs against Canada. In a post on X, Dominic LeBlanc says the tariffs will be postponed until 2 April - just like the US's - \"while we continue to work for the removal of all tariffs\". But Ontario Premier Doug Ford says \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\" and \"until President Trump removes the threat of tariffs for good, we will be relentless\". \"The only thing that's certain today is more uncertainty,\" he writes in a post on X. Ford has previously announced that he will implement a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from Canadian power. Nada TawfikReporting from New York Businessman Donald Trump and his wife Ivana appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show in Chicago, Illinois, 25 April, 1988 As a young real estate developer, Trump believed just as strongly in tariffs as a tool to pressure other countries to open their markets as he does today.   A key factor in shaping his views was his \"tremendous resentment for Japan\", as he often complained that he had difficulties doing deals with large groups of Japanese businessmen.  \"I'm tired of watching other countries ripping off the United States.\"  This Trump quote could've been pulled from his 2016 election campaign, but it's actually from the late 80s when he made an appearance on CNN's Larry King Live, around the time he first floated his name as a potential presidential candidate.  Fresh from sharing his business philosophy in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Trump went on a tirade against America's trade policies in national interviews. In an animated interview with Oprah Winfrey, he said he would handle foreign policy differently by making the country's allies \"pay their fair share\".  There wasn't free trade when Japan was \"dumping\" products into America's market but making it \"impossible to do business\" there, he added. Read more about Trump's early career views on tariffs here: How Japan sparked Trump's 40-year love affair with tariffs. The president says \"the big one\" will be on 2 April when countries could face reciprocal tariffs. An example of a \"high-tariff nation\" at the moment is Canada, Trump says, and lists off products that he believes the Canadians overcharge the US in tariffs. \"We don't need trees from Canada, we don't need cars from Canada, we don't need energy from Canada, we don't need anything from Canada,\" the president says. Asked about this specific USMCA exemption announced today, Trump calls it a \"short-term modification\" implemented because it \"would've hurt the American car companies\" if tariffs were enforced. Asked if car manufacturers can expect the same sort of exemption again next month, the president replies: \"We're not looking at that\". This video can not be played Watch: Trump says tariff exemptions not influenced by the markets The president was just speaking in the Oval Office, while signing a fresh raft of executive orders. Asked by reporters why the markets have been spooked by his recent announcements of tariffs, Trump says \"a lot of them are globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things\". The president says \"this is something that we have to do\" and \"there'll always be a little short-term interruption\". And on whether some of these exemptions announced today have been influenced by the market, Trump says \"no\". \"I'm not even looking at the market because long-term the United States will be very strong with what's happening here,\" he says. More now from President Trump's signing of  two orders pausing tariffs on Mexico and Canada for USMCA-compliant goods - though the fees remain in place on other goods. Trump confirms that steel and aluminium tariffs will proceed next week and warned automakers not to request another carve-out next month. We're getting some more details on these new tariff pauses for Canada and Mexico now as we hear lines from Trump speaking to reporters in the Oval Office a few minutes ago. \"We had a very good conversation,\" Trump says of his earlier phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, saying the US helped them out with a \"problem\" they were having with the tariffs. Stay with us, we'll bring you more lines as we hear them.  Canada has been given the same tariff suspension deal as Mexico was earlier today, according to White House officials - that's an exemption for all goods imported under the USMCA trade agreement until 2 April. While around half of Mexico's goods are covered by the USMCA, that percentage is less for Canada - so some goods from both countries will still be subject to these tariffs. On what changed Donald Trump's mind, White House officials say it was due to promises made from car manufacturers to start moving their supply chains back to the US. It was also partly due to work the two countries have done to show a commitment to cutting fentanyl deaths, they say. Both executive orders have just been signed by the president in the Oval Office. They're titled: âAmendments to duties to address the flow of illicit drugs across our northern borderâ and âAmendments to duties to address the flow of illicit drugs across our southern borderâ. This video can not be played Watch: Trump signs order pausing some Mexico and Canada tariffs President Donald Trump signs a deal to suspend some of the Canada tariffs until 2 April, hours after signing a similar exemption for Mexico. Stay with us as we continue to bring you the latest. President Trump hails tariffs as a miracle tool to usher in a new \"golden age\" - a key campaign promise. He calls \"tariff\" the fourth-most beautiful word in the dictionary, after âGod,\" âlove,â and âreligionâ. To Trump, tariffs solve everything: the national deficit, immigration, jobs, fentanyl trafficking, and national security.  In his address to the joint session of Congress earlier this week, the Republican president declared tariffs  \"are about protecting the soul of our countryâ¦ making America rich again and making America great again\". Experts say tariffs can counter unfair trade practices but warn they may fuel inflation and slow economic growth. Last month, The Wall Street Journal editorial board called Trump's plan âthe dumbest trade war in history\". Still, his commitment remains firm. On Thursday, his commerce secretary reinforced the message: âThe president is focused on rebuilding America, and you are going to see growth in America... Youâre going to see interest rates drop 1% or more. Youâre going to see the stock market explode.â  Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Trumpâs whiplash trade actions are coming against a backdrop of worried financial markets and other financial data suggesting cracks may be starting to form in the US economy. Gregory Brown, who leads BenLee - a company that makes big trailers - says he has had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trumpâs policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium. But Mr Brown, one of the business people I buttonholed after the speech of the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Economic Club of New York, says for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices â a sign that the economy is holding up. âItâs a great growth economy,â he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trumpâs decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs was a sign of a business friendly president adjusting to the âbusiness realityâ. But others I spoke to were more worried that the back-and-forth would cause economic damage. âI think weâre going to have a recession before whatever succeeds in the future,â one of the investment managers I spoke to warned: âYouâre going to get the bad before you get the good.â Nomia IqbalNorth America correspondent Keeping on top of Donald\nTrumpâs tariffs is no easy task. From actual announcements to threats, itâs\nhard to know exactly what his policy is. Earlier this week he\nenacted 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico after delaying them for a month\nfollowing his initial threat. Yesterday, he announced\ntemporary relief for carmakers on tariffs on Mexico and Canada and, now, many\nmore of the sweeping tariffs imposed on Mexican goods imported to the United\nStates will be suspended until 2 April. We know Trump\nloves tariffs and so it may be a negotiating tactic aimed at winning policy\nconcessions in deals with other countries. But thereâs a risk that if it is\nshort-term posturing, it could get less effective the more he does it - because\ncountries will see what he's doing. To a large extent,\nTrumpâs chaos is the point - and it politically appeals to so many people who\nvoted for him. But it has sown confusion, leaving markets scrambling and\nrelations strained with allies. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says she presented US President Donald Trump with data showing her country's work towards stopping fentanyl from crossing the border. During a news conference, she says that in the \"respectful call\" she told Trump that in February \"the reduction in fentanyl seizures on the US side of the border with Mexico was reduced by 41.5%\". Sheinbaum adds that she also told Trump that Mexico's decision to put 10,000 guards at the border, as well as the customs review, was \"giving results\". Addressing the US president, she says: \"Now that you put in the tariffs - how are we going to continue cooperating and collaborating with something that hurts the people of Mexico?'â Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter The stakes are rising for 2 April when the Trump administration has promised to set out its plans for \"reciprocal\"  tariffs. During a speech at the Economic Club of New York this afternoon, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appears to suggest that moment would kick-off a series of trade negotiations with countries around the world. He also offers a glimpse of what discussions on tariffs with the UK and the EU might look like - focusing on the taxes on tech firms Europe and Britain have imposed in recent years. Bessent says the White House will be pushing back against those policies, noting UK PM Keir Starmer's recent visit and saying the leaders had a \"very good discussion about getting going on all of this and more\".  The treasury secretary also suggests foreign leaders should keep their cool when negotiating with Donald Trump, and offers unusually pointed criticism of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh weâre going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,â\" he says. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he had a \"colourful\" conversation on the subject of tariffs in a phone call with US President Donald Trump. Canadian public broadcaster CBC News, citing a senior Canadian government source, reports Trump used profane language more than once during a heated exchange around dairy that took place on Wednesday. Trudeau says the nearly hour-long call was \"substantive\" and discussions are ongoing. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic plans - he says they will help boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, as well as raise tax revenue and grow the economy. Goods from China, Mexico and Canada - three of his recent targets for tariffs - accounted for more than 40% of imports into the US in 2024. When the president first announced his plans for new tariffs, the White House said, external Trump was \"taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country\". Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year. The Trump administration says the chemicals come from China, while Mexican gangs supply it illegally and run fentanyl labs in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US, most of which comes from Mexico. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Trump announces month-long suspension of Mexico tariffs",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Trump signs order pausing some Mexico and Canada tariffs US President Donald Trump has signed orders significantly expanding the goods exempted from his new tariffs on Canada and Mexico that were imposed this week. It is the second time in two days that Trump has rolled back his taxes on imports from the US's two biggest trade partners, measures that have raised uncertainty for businesses and worried financial markets. On Wednesday, he said he would temporarily spare carmakers from 25% import levies just a day after they came into effect. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum thanked Trump for the move, while Canada's finance minister said the country would in turn hold off on its threatened second round of retaliatory tariffs on US products. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday morning he had had a \"colourful\" conversation about tariffs in a phone call with Trump. The US president used profane language more than once during Wednesday's heated exchange, according to US and Canadian media reports.  Trudeau told reporters that a trade war between the two allies was likely for the foreseeable future, despite some targeted relief. \"Our goal remains to get these tariffs, all tariffs removed,\" he said. Sheinbaum said she had had an \"excellent and respectful\" call with Trump, adding that the two countries would work together to stem the flow of the opioid fentanyl from Mexico into the US and curb the trafficking of guns going the other way. The carveout from the duties applies to goods shipped under North America's free trade pact, the US-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA) , which Trump signed during his first term.  Items that currently come into the US under the pact's rules include televisions, air conditioners, avocados and beef, according to analysis by the firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. The measures also reduced tariffs on potash - a key ingredient for fertiliser needed by US farmers - from 25% to 10%. A White House official said about 50% of US imports from Mexico and 62% from Canada may still face tariffs. Those proportions could change as firms change their practices in response to the order. The White House has also continued to promote its plans for other tariffs, promising action on 2 April, when officials have said they will unveil recommendations for tailored \"reciprocal\" trade duties on countries around the world. As US and Canada trade barbs, it's so far so good for Mexico's Sheinbaum What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? The trade war tensions have rattled markets and raised fears of economic turbulence.  The S&P 500 share index, which tracks the biggest listed American companies, ended down nearly 1.8% on Thursday.  George Godber, fund manager at Polar Capital, said the \"hokey cokey\" with Trump's tariffs has it made it \"nigh on impossible\" for firms to manage their production lines and is \"putting pressure on the US economy\". Meanwhile, he said it is \"galvanising a response from Europe, especially Germany, so we've seen a more positive reaction to European markets\". In signing the orders, Trump dismissed the suggestion that he was walking back the measures because of concerns about the stock market.  \"Nothing to do with the market,\" Trump said. \"I'm not even looking at the market, because long term, the United States will be very strong with what's happening.\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, said afterwards that \"a pause on some tariffs means nothing\".  Earlier, as relief looked likely but before it was announced, he told CNN that the province still planned to go ahead with a 25% tariff on the electricity it provides to 1.5 million homes and businesses in New York, Michigan and Minnesota from Monday. \"Honestly, it really bothers me. We have to do this, but I don't want to do this,\" he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday dismissed retaliation as counter-productive for trade negotiations.  \"If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, 'Oh we're going to do this', then tariffs are probably going to go up,\" he said during a question-and-answer session after a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday.  Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and the economies of the three countries are deeply integrated after decades of free trade.   Trump has argued introducing tariffs will protect American industry and boost manufacturing. However, many economists say tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US, while warning they could trigger severe economic downturns in Mexico and Canada.  About $1bn in trade enters the US from Mexico and Canada each day that does not claim duty-free exemptions under USMCA, since it has historically enjoyed low or no tariffs, said Daniel Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Whether importers can or will start claiming USMCA remains to be seen, but it's a huge amount of money at stake,\" he said.  In the US, the economy is already starting to show the effects of the disruption from Trump's policies.  Imports spiked in January on the back of tariff fears, with America's trade deficit increasing 34% to more than $130bn (Â£100bn), the Commerce Department reported.  Gregory Brown, who leads BenLee, a company that makes big trailers, said he had had to adjust prices multiple times over the last five weeks as a result of Trump's policies, which have included an order, set to go into effect later this month, expanding tariffs on steel and aluminium. But Mr Brown, who attended Mr Bessent's speech, said that for now, his customers are agreeing to pay the higher prices â a sign that the economy is holding up. \"It's a great growth economy,\" he said, noting that the economy had been strong under Biden too.  He said he saw Trump's decision to quickly offer relief from his new tariffs as a sign of a business-friendly president adjusting to the \"business reality\".

        "title": "Girl killed by car on Kendal pitch was 'force of nature'",
        "content": "Poppy Atkinson was determined to be a professional footballer, her family said A girl who was killed when a car crashed on to a pitch where she was playing football was a \"force of nature\", her family has said. Poppy Atkinson, 10, was fatally struck by the vehicle while attending a training session at Kendal Rugby Club in Cumbria on Wednesday evening. Her family described her as the \"focal point of their lives\". She was determined to be a professional footballer and play for Manchester United, they said. An eight-year-old girl, also from Kendal, was taken to hospital for treatment but her injuries were not life-threatening. Cumbria Police arrested a 40-year-old man from Lancaster on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but said there was \"no indication to suggest that this incident was a deliberate act\". He remains in police custody. Poppy Atkinson (pictured with her brother Edward) touched so many lives, her family said Poppy's family said their lives revolved around the \"small, petite and beautiful\" girl's love for football, adding: \"Many who know her, and who know her determination to improve and win, had no doubt she would achieve her goal to one day to play for Manchester United. \"She was a force of nature. She was so special, she was too good for this world. \"Poppy touched so many lives, it was easy to see why, her energy, character, spirit and passion for football was infectious and touched huge numbers of people. \"The hole in our lives and so many around us that Poppy leaves is enormous, we will never be whole again.\" Poppy's headteacher, Nick Turley, said she had a \"wonderful sense of humour\" Nick Turley, the headteacher of Old Hutton CE Primary School, where Poppy was a pupil, said the community was devastated. \"Poppy was someone who brought joy, light and happiness to all she did,\" he said, adding: \"She had a wonderful sense of humour and a deep love of life.  \"Our prayers will remain with Poppy's family and as a school community we will do all we can to support them.\" Poppy's family said her favourite Manchester United players included Ella Toone and Kobbie Mainoo. In response, the club said: \"On behalf of Ella, Kobbie and everyone at Manchester United, we send our heartfelt condolences to Poppy's family and friends for their devastating loss. \"Rest in peace Poppy.\" Eyewitness Scott Denney said it \"all happened very fast\" as the car appeared on the pitch at Kendal rugby club just before 17:00 GMT. \"Just as we got on to the pitch, a car came through the barriers at the top and then landed on the pitch,\" he said. Mr Denney, whose son attends the GT7 Football Academy which holds training sessions at the rugby club, said he had \"no idea\" how the car got on to the field. \"It was just sheer panic. It was just not very nice at all,\" he said. \"The children were obviously scared but the coaches dealt with it really, really well.\" Staff got the children off the field and out of view of the crash site, he added. He said: \"Last night there were a lot of families here that pulled together to give support to the mum and dad and friends of the little girl.\" Floral tributes have been laid at the scene People have laid floral tributes and Kendal Rugby Club has cancelled its fixtures this weekend. Club director Reg Burrow said staff were \"shell-shocked\". He said there was a kerb, footpath and fence between the car park and the playing area and \"you wouldn't anticipate any car could gain enough speed to land as it did on the pitch\". Poppy's football team, Kendal United, said, following guidance, all training sessions would continue as scheduled \"to provide our young players with the stability and routine that is important to help children process such tragic events\". The club committee said they were working to provide \"as much support as possible\" and welfare officers were on hand. \"Words cannot express the sorrow we feel as a club community during this extremely difficult time,\" they said.

        "content": "Nigerian senators voted to suspend Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan for six months Nigerian lawmakers have suspended a senator for six months, after she submitted a petition alleging she had been sexually harassed by the senate president. Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan first made the accusations against one of the country's top politicians, Godswill Akpabio in an interview last Friday. After dismissing her petition on procedural grounds, the ethics committee recommended Uduaghan's suspension, saying she had brought \"public opprobrium\" to the upper chamber of the National Assembly. Some senators argued that her suspension be cut to three months but a majority voted to stick with the six months suspension recommended by the ethics committee. Women's rights activist Hadiza Ado told the BBC that Senator Uduaghan's suspension was a âsad day for Nigerian women\". Uduaghan afterwards described her suspension as \"an injustice that will not be sustained\". She vowed to continue her  \"pursuit for justice\" over her treatment. The Senate leadership later stressed that Uduaghan had been suspended because she had engaged in \"unruly and disruptive\" behaviour during the session, and not because of her allegations against Akpabio. The accusations have dominated discussions across Nigeria since she first made them nearly a week ago. Many highly placed people and groups have called for a transparent investigation. On Wednesday, two groups of protesters gathered at the assembly ground in the capital, Abuja - one backing Akpabio and the other in support of his colleague, chanting ''Akpabio must go.'' Mrs Ado, who founded the Women and Children Initiative, said: âWeâve been following events at the Assembly keenly and hoping that investigation into Natashaâs allegations would follow.â âAll we can say is that today is a sad day for Nigerian women fighting for emancipation. Out of 109 senators, only four are women and one is now suspended,â she said. Many women on social media also expressed their anger over the suspension, with some calling it âoppression.â During her suspension, Uduaghan will be barred from the National Assembly premises and her office will be locked.

        "content": "Kyle Clifford, 26, of Enfield, north London, is found guilty of raping Louise Hunt, 25, just before he killed her in July last year He had already admitted shooting her and her sister Hannah Hunt, 28, with a crossbow and fatally stabbing their mother, 61-year-old Carol Hunt, at the family home in Bushey, Hertfordshire Relatives and friends of the Hunt family clapped as the verdict came in, our reporter in court writes Louise ended her relationship with Clifford more than two weeks before the murders, Cambridge Crown Court heard Clifford's attacks were \"fuelled\" by the \"violent misogyny promoted\" by social media influencer Andrew Tate, prosecutors said Clifford was not in court and is paralysed from the chest down after shooting himself with the crossbow after the attack The three women were the wife and daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt Clifford is due to be sentenced for the murders and rape on Tuesday, 11 March Written by Brian Farmer, Louise Parry and Laura Devlin. Edited by Peter Walker and Andrew Woodger After being found guilty of rape by a jury on Thursday, Kyle Clifford will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court next Tuesday. The jury took less than an hour to deliver its unanimous verdict. The 26-year-old from Enfield will be sentenced for the three murders, the rape, false imprisonment and possession of offensive weapons. Our live coverage of the day of the rape verdict is ending. John Hunt, the father and husband of Louise, Hannah and Carol, \"adored\" his family, his friend Matt Chapman said in the immediate aftermath of the murders.Mr Hunt, a BBC racing commentator, has previously urged people to \"make the most of every day\" after losing three of his family in the crossbow and knife attack.He also said that \"every message of support \"feels like a hug\". \"Family means more to some than others and for John, his family unit was something he absolutely adored,\" Mr Chapman said. During the same police interview, Clifford was questioned about a second note on his phone addressed \"to myself\", where he said: \"I don't want\nto live my life without her\". Clifford added: \"I don't want to\nexperience new things. \"Nothing I can think of can make me happy. \"I know I could have gone to therapy, found faith\nand become a new better person but I just simply don't want to. \"I am so sorry I didn't wait to move on and find my\nfuture wife, have the children I always wanted.\" The officer told Clifford the note was \"very self-centred note and doesn't take into account anyone else\". During a police interview carried out on 16 September, officers asked Kyle Clifford about notes he had made on his phone. One, addressed to different family members, begins:\n\"Please don't think of this as me throwing my life away. \"I know you will all have so many questions and wish\nyou could have done something different to prevent this however none of you\nhave failed and there is simply nothing any of you could have done.\" The officers asked him if he had already planned the\nthree murders when he wrote that note, and Clifford whispered \"no\ncomment\". Hertfordshire Police said that prior to his police interview, when he was still recovering and being treated for his crossbow injuries, Clifford had said he was \"sorry\" and \"what I\nhave done is atrocious\". Kyle Clifford spent 10 weeks in hospital with a\nround-the-clock police guard before he could be interviewed about the attacks on 9 July. Police video showed him in a wheelchair refusing to\nengage and answering âno commentâ to questions on 16 September. He shows no emotion when asked about the killings but appears to choke back tears after he is asked about a note on his phone,\nwritten about himself. Kyle Clifford served in the Army for about two years before leaving in 2022 Kyle Clifford's behaviour in the days following his break-up with Louise Hunt appears to have escalated at an unprecedented rate\", according to Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner, senior investigating officer in the case. Clifford then \"plotted a meticulously planned attack on Louise and members of her family\", the officer said. The 26-year-old ex-soldier had shown a \"complete inability and unwillingness... to actually deal with [the break-up] appropriately\", he added.

She manages to message her partner asking them to call the police. 18:55: Clifford walks away from the property carrying the black rucksack, with the crossbow hidden under a sheet. 18:57:  Hannah Hunt is recorded by home security systems screaming \"Oh my God, no\" as she realises her sister and mother have been attacked.  18:58: Hannah Hunt uses Carol Hunt's phone to dial 999 and identifies Clifford as the attacker to the call handler.  19:10: Emergency services arrive at the house. Carol and Louise Hunt are found dead and unsuccessful resuscitation attempts are made on Hannah.  A manhunt ensues. 10 July: Clifford is found injured at Lavender Hill Cemetery, in Enfield, in north London, after shooting himself in the chest with the crossbow. He is taken to hospital with serious injuries and later charged with the murders. Kyle Clifford's older brother was jailed in 2018 for the \"senseless and barbaric killing\" a man on a scooter in Enfield, north London. Bradley Clifford, then aged 24, gave chase and ploughed into the scooter in his Ford Mustang after the rider Sobhan Khan,18, and his pillion passenger hit his car with a bottle and damaged it. Mr Khan was sent flying into the air and died as a result of his injuries, while the other man was hurt, but survived. Clifford was jailed for 23 years after being found guilty of murder and attempted GBH with intent. Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner said the decision to prosecute on the rape charge had been the correct one, even though Clifford had admitted three murders.  \"Absolutely right,\" he said. \"I think it shows the full gravity of his offending and the character that he is.\" He agreed with a suggestion that Louise's last few hours of life must have been \"horrific\".   Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner, the senior investigating officer in the case, has been speaking about Clifford's motives.  \"I don't think this is the case of a spurned lover in any way,\" he said. \"He [Clifford] simply couldn't deal with what he perceived to be a dent to his pride. \"He then sought to control the situation, in terms of weapons purchases, the cold, calculating way in which he lay in wait in the house for her [Louise].\"  26 June 2024: Louise Hunt tells Clifford their\nrelationship is over  In a message read out in court during\nCliffordâs trial, she says: \"I'm sorry Kyle but I feel I can't continue\nwith what we have, I feel like it has been broken and I can't ignore how I've\nbeen feeling.â  She wishes him well and asks him to âtake\ncare of yourself always pleaseâ.  30 June: Clifford makes internet searches in relation to crossbows and visits websites where they could be purchased.  3 July: Clifford purchases a  crossbow and a pack of six crossbow bolts. 4 July:\nClifford buys two petrol cans from Halfords and two rolls of duct tape from B&Q.   Senior investigator Det Ch Insp Gardner echoed the judge's praise for the behaviour of relatives during the trial. He said he did not know why Clifford had admitted murder, and other charges, but not rape. \"I don't know. The evidence was overwhelming. He was arguing against commonly accepted science.\" Mr Gardner added: \"He knew the game was up. I have no idea why he failed to plead. \"The jury saw through his lies.\"  Hannah was heard on audio at the Hunt family home saying \"Kyle I swear to God\" after returning home and appearing to find Clifford in the house. Prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said Hannah messaged her partner, Alex Klein, telling him: \"Call police... immediately. To mine. Now. \"Kyle here. Police now. He's tying us up.\" The court heard that customers of Louise's dog grooming\nbusiness, based in a pod in the Hunt family's garden, were using the gate at\nthe side of the house \"not realising what was happening\" when Carol\nwas murdered. The jury panel was told a faint scream could be heard\nfrom the address shortly after Louise entered the house, and she was later found to\nhave been restrained with tape at the wrist and ankles. Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner said, after the trial, that Clifford's refusal to attend the trial, either in person or via an online link, was \"cowardice\".  Clifford was tried in his absence after refusing to leave\nhis cell at HMP Belmarsh. \"[It] was an absolute act of cowardice by Clifford,\" said Det Ch Insp Gardner. \"Every reasonable adjustment was made by the judge. The trial was moved here for his (Clifford's) reasonable accessibility needs.\" The Crown Prosecution Service said the \"weight of evidence against Clifford\" gave him little option but to admit murdering the three women. Prosecutors worked closely with Hertfordshire Police to build a case \"which painted a clear picture of a sinister and premediated attack against the Hunt family\". Digital evidence showed Clifford making online orders for a knife, crossbow and duct tape. He was also captured on CCTV arriving near the Hunt family home in his car on the afternoon of the murders. Lucy ManningSpecial correspondent, Cambridge Crown Court Clifford bought the crossbow online. Questions will be raised about their easy purchase but this is also about those who choose to use weapons to attack and murder women. What is sadly unsurprising, but is still devastating, is yet again innocent women are the victims of male violence in their own homes, by someone they knew. Clifford was an ex-boyfriend whose response to rejection was to rape and murder. Prosecutor Helen Morgan KC said that in the days leading up to the attacks, Clifford had searched for how to purchase a crossbow and had accessed pornography, including for a video of former HMP Wandsworth prison officer Linda De Sousa Abreu, who admitted having sex with a prisoner last year. The prosecutor said the defendant's violent intentions were shown \"through the use of weapons and his sexual preoccupations\". The court heard Clifford's killing spree took place over several hours in three separate attacks. He firstly stabbed Carol to death while her daughter Louise was working in a garden office, where she ran a dog grooming business. After Louise came inside, he restrained, raped and then murdered her with a crossbow, jurors heard. Prosecutors said he then killed Hannah with the crossbow when she came home after work.  This video can not be played Clifford was caught on CCTV at a garden centre on the day of the murders Clifford's sister had messaged Clifford on the day of the attacks, asking him \"what are you playing at?\" when she realised he had taken the crossbow out with him. He told her he was doing nothing \"illegal\" and he was shooting it in his friend's back garden, the jurors were told. Following the murders, he became the subject of a manhunt for a number of hours before he was found injured in Lavender Hill Cemetery, in Enfield, north London, after shooting himself in the chest with the crossbow. The jury was told he was now paralysed from the chest downwards. To watch and listen, you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Crossbow Killer Found Guilty Of Rape. BBC News.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Canadian liquor store clears out US alcohol in response to tariffs Canadian provinces pulling US alcohol off store shelves in response to Trump trade policy is \"worse than tariffs\", the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said. Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario, which is by far the most populated, took action this week in retaliation for US tariffs on Canadian goods. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), one of the largest buyers of alcohol in the world, removed US-made alcoholic drinks from its shelves on Tuesday. Brown-Forman boss Lawson Whiting said the Canadian response was \"disproportionate\" to the 25% levies on Canadian goods imposed by the Trump administration. \"I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,\" Mr Whiting said. In response to the tariffs, Canada has retaliated with 25% levies on goods imported from the US, including beer, spirits, and wine. Some provinces also took action themselves, including Ontario and Nova Scotia. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the LCBO sells nearly $1bn of US alcohol per year. \"As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves,\" Mr Ford said on Tuesday. The LCBO is the exclusive wholesaler in Ontario, which means other retailers, bars and restaurants in the province will no longer be able to restock US products, Mr Ford said. Nevertheless, Mr Whiting said Canada makes up only 1% of Brown-Forman's total sales, so the firm can withstand the hit. Canadians are being advised by the LCBO to buy products made in Canada. Some Canadians have been turning to local goods anyway in response to the Trump tariffs. Canadian stores in some provinces, including Ontario, have been removing US-made alcohol from shelves in response to Trump tariffs Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, criticised the US tariffs on Tuesday, saying imposing them was \"a very dumb thing to do\". He also accused the US president of planning \"a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us\". Trump has made a number of remarks about making Canada the 51st state of his country, which Canada's Foreign Minister MÃ©lanie Joly has said she takes \"very seriously\". Washington has also placed 25% tariffs on Mexico, although Trump has said he will temporarily spare carmakers in both Canada and Mexico from the taxes. Trump has accused both Canada and Mexico of failing to do enough to stem the flow of the fentanyl opioid into the US, an argument that has been rejected by both countries. Mr Whiting said Brown-Forman was going to see what happens in Mexico, which accounted for 7% of its sales in 2024.

        "title": "Bacterial vaginosis: Common vaginal 'imbalance' may be an STI",
        "content": "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers. The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex. However, a study, external claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.  The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection. BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell. The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery. Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics. The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach. One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI. \"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added. In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.  Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected â that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".  \"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.  If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic.

        "title": "Mozambique injuries as police fire on Venâncio Mondlane's convoy",
        "content": "Mozambique's opposition leader has vowed to continue anti-government protests At least a dozen people were injured after Mozambican police violently dispersed a protest led by opposition leader VenÃ¢ncio Mondlane, the runner-up in last year's disputed presidential election, Mondlane's team and a civil society group say.  Eyewitnesses and Mondlane's aides said the police fired live rounds at the opposition leader's convoy and the anti-government protesters who had joined him on the streets of the capital, Maputo, on Wednesday. Neither the police nor the authorities have commented. The protests came as President Daniel Chapo, who took office in January, was due to sign a deal after talks with other political parties to end months of protests over the disputed election. Mondlane, who has been calling for the protests, was excluded from the talks leading to the ceremony. A communique from Mondlane's office said the opposition leader had been leading a procession on Wednesday afternoon when his convoy came under fire. \"A contingent of the UIR [a rapid intervention police unit] rammed into VenÃ¢ncio Mondlane's convoy and began a barrage of gunfire, using live ammunition and tear gas,\" it added. In response to the incident, Interior Minister Paulo Chachine told reporters that the police had a mission to prevent any attempt to disrupt the deal-signing ceremony. He denied that there had been an attempt to kill Mondlane. Sixteen people were injured, according to local civil society group Plataforma Decide. The BBC has not been able to confirm the casualty figures. Mondlane's team said two children from a nearby school had died from the shooting. It said 16 people had been injured, including their camera person, with others seriously affected by tear gas.  In a statement, it said Mondlane's condition was \"unknown, and his whereabouts are causing concern among his entire team\". A video shared on social media shows the moment when gunshots started ringing out as the procession approached what looks like an armoured vehicle on the streets. People run for safety and the crowds disappear, while the gunfire continues. More images of people bloodied from the incident have also been shared online. A witness, who was among the protesters, told the AFP news agency that police had started shooting, as if it was an \"ambush scenario. It was just a march\". \"I saw some people bleeding from their wounds. My friend was wounded in the leg. I also saw a child who was shot and lost his life in hospital,\" AFP quoted 27-year old protester Silvestre Alexandre as saying. The police were accused of using live bullets to disperse protesters Mozambique's former colonial power, Portugal, has condemned \"the unacceptable attack on VenÃ¢ncio Mondlane's convoy\" while calling for \"restraint from violence and respect for fundamental rights\". In a post on X, the Portuguese foreign affairs ministry has also offered condolences to the bereaved families.  Since President Chapo took over in January, he has made promises for a broad political dialogue that would include various sectors of the society, in order to end the country's post-election crisis. Some analysts have however criticised him for excluding Mondlane from the talks. On Wednesday, Mondlane condemned the political deal, calling it \"an agreement of people without the people\". He said that protests would continue. \"If they don't do what the people want, they won't govern Mozambique,\" he said. Since October, close to 400 people have died in violence linked to the protests, according to civil society organisations.

        "title": "Denmark's postal service to stop delivering letters",
        "content": "Denmark's letter deliveries began in 1624 Denmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90% decline in letter volumes since the start of the century. The decision brings to an end 400 years of the company's letter service. Denmark's 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June. Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as \"there is a free market for both letters and parcels\". Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germany's Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a \"socially responsible manner\". Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come. Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically. PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026, external. Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600. \"It's a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future,\" employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR. Denmark ranks as one of the world's most digitalised countries.  There's an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers' licences and health cards on their smartphones. Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically. Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable.  Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year. Letters handled by PostNord (in millions) The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95% of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail. \"There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care,\" Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmark's TV2. PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit.  Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas. The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs. \"When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (Â£3.35; $4.20) there will be fewer letters,\" PostNord Denmark's Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media. He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30% in the past year alone. PostNord also operates in Sweden. It is 40% Danish-owned and 60% Swedish-owned.

        "content": " Melvyn Bragg and guests explore the life and work of John Soane, architect of the old Bank of England and collector of the antiquities displayed in his home which became a museum. Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the architect Sir John Soane (1753 -1837), the son of a bricklayer. He rose up the ranks of his profession as an architect to see many of his designs realised to great acclaim, particularly the Bank of England and the Law Courts at Westminster Hall, although his work on both of those has been largely destroyed. He is now best known for his house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London, which he remodelled and crammed with antiquities and artworks: he wanted visitors to experience the house as a dramatic grand tour of Europe in microcosm. He became professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, and in a series of influential lectures he set out his belief in the power of buildings to enlighten people about “the poetry of architecture”. Visitors to the museum and his other works can see his trademark architectural features such as his shallow dome, which went on to inspire Britain's red telephone boxes.

        "title": "More women doctors than men for first time in UK",
        "content": "There are more female doctors than male doctors in the UK for the first time, figures show. The General Medical Council (GMC) said the number of women on its register had overtaken men for the first time, although numbers vary across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some 164,440 women are registered with a licence to practise, making up 50.04% of the register, compared with 164,195 men, the medical regulator said. One of the driving factors has been the rising number of women joining UK medical schools, it added. Since 2018/19, there have been more female than male medical students in each of the four nations, the regulator said. Its figures show there were hardly any female doctors more than 150 years ago when the register first opened in 1859. This remained the case for decades but started rising from the turn of the century, with a rapid increase from the 1970s. Currently more women than men work as doctors in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with fewer female doctors in England and Wales, the GMC said. The medical specialties with the most women doctors are obstetrics and gynaecology and paediatrics. Surgery, ophthalmology and emergency medicine have the least women.  The GMC said there are also more female GPs in the UK, with 57.7% of the workforce made up of female doctors. Professor Dame Carrie MacEwen, chairwoman of the GMC and a consultant ophthalmologist, said the demographics of the medical workforce are \"rapidly changing, and that diversity will benefit patients\". She continued: \"But women training for careers in medicine continue to face challenges that must be acknowledged and tackled. \"And for those women already working as doctors there is still work to do to create supportive and inclusive workplaces, and to ensure they have access to progression opportunities, including leadership roles, so that they can have long and fulfilling careers in medicine.\" Figures from the GMC's training survey about discrimination in the workplace found 9% of female respondents reported unwelcome sexual comments, or advances causing embarrassment, distress or offence, compared with just 4% of men. Dr Latifa Patel, chairwoman of the British Medical Association representative body, called the development a \"significant milestone for the profession and for patients\". \"Retaining women doctors in the workplace, in the NHS, and happy and fulfilled in their roles, must be a priority,\" she added. Professor Scarlett McNally, president of the Medical Women's Federation and a surgeon, said: \"This huge change should be celebrated.\" Workplace sexual-harassment clampdown for doctors Overseas doctors will remain 'crucial' to UK Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Tottenham Street: Fire crews tackle central London blaze",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Plumes of smoke above London's West End About 40 firefighters have tackled a fire in central London, as smoke was seen spreading across the capital's skyline. Crews were called to a fire at two buildings near Tottenham Street at 07:43 GMT on Thursday, the London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. Six fire engines were called to the scene, and two hours later, the fire was under control, the brigade said. The LFB said an investigation had begun into the cause of the fire.  Alec McNally, station commander at the LFB, said the fire spread towards the roof of the building Alec McNally, station commander at the LFB, said: \"This morning crews were called to a fire at Tottenham Street that involved two buildings. \"[They] had to put out a fire that had developed onto an atrium-style conservatory, which was towards the roof of the building.\" He added that the fire was now under control and one adult was rescued by firefighters and taken to hospital with \"mild smoke inhalation\". The brigade urged people to avoid the area and keep windows and doors closed to avoid smoke. Approximately 40 firefighters are attending the scene  BBC reporter Gem O'Reilly, at the scene, described the smell of the smoke as \"horrendous\" and \"like burning chemicals\". One local resident added that it was a \"toxic and acrid\" smell. The London Ambulance Service said that its first paramedic arrived at the scene less than two minutes after the emergency alert was received.  \"We sent a number of resources to the scene, including ambulance crews and members of our Hazardous Area Response Team,\" a spokesperson said. \"We treated one patient at the scene and took her to hospital.\" Police and ambulance crews are also at the scene The LFB said half of the ground floor of the building was alight, and the brigade used one of its 32m turntable ladders to help fight the fire from above. Crews from Soho, Euston, Islington and surrounding fire stations were at the scene. On Thursday afternoon, the LFB said one fire engine remained at the scene alongside its fire investigation unit.  The cause of the fire is not yet known, the LFB said.

        "title": "Glastonbury 2025: Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX and The 1975 to headline",
        "content": "Olivia Rodrigo will become the second-youngest act to headline the Pyramid Stage US pop star Olivia Rodrigo and British band The 1975 will headline the Glastonbury festival this summer, organisers have announced. They will be joined by five-time Brit Award winner Charli XCX - who will top the bill on the festival's second stage on Saturday 28 June. There will also be debut Glastonbury performances by Alanis Morisette, Noah Kahan, Gracie Abrams, Lola Young and US rap phenomenon Doechii, who will headline the West Holts stage. Returning favourites include Wolf Alice, Wet Leg, Fatboy Slim, Loyle Carner and Scissor Sisters. Rock legend Neil Young has already been announced as the Saturday night headliner, with Rod Stewart playing the Sunday afternoon \"legend slot\". Sidetracked podcast: Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw react to Glastonbury's headliners The 1975 have played Glastonbury several times, but this will be their first headline appearance Cheshire's The 1975 are festival veterans, who have headlined the Reading and Leeds festival three times since 2016 - but this will be their first time at the top of Glastonbury's line-up. Balancing hooky dance-rock with more experimental forays into electronica and even ambient music, they pepper their lyrics with references to online relationships, chemical dependency and wry, self-aware humour. Frontman Matty Healy is known for his provocative, and often divisive, actions. On their recent tour, he has been spotted chewing raw steak, berating security guards via Auto-Tune, and passionately kissing fans in the front row. More seriously, the band are being sued by organisers of a Malaysian festival, which was shut down after Healy kissed one of his bandmates on stage.  The singer said he was protesting at the country's anti-LGBT laws, under which homosexual acts can be punished by 20 years in prison. \"I feel like they'll be great headliners,\" said BBC 6 Music's Nick Grimshaw, speaking on the Sidetracked podcast. \"They have great taste and great vision - and they're a band who will think about do a bespoke show.\" Olivia Rodrigo drew a huge audience for her Glastonbury debut in 2022 Rodrigo is the first Glastonbury headliner to have broken through in the 2020s - and the second-youngest solo headliner of all time, after Billie Eilish, who was 20 when she topped the bill in 2022. Like Eilish, the 22-year-old will play the Pyramid Stage with just two albums to her name, but she has a solid armoury of fist-pumping pop-punk singalongs (Good 4 U, Brutal, Get Him Back), alongside lighters-aloft ballads like Driver's License and Vampire. An accomplished live performer, her 2024 Guts tour banked $186m (Â£144m) in ticket sales; and she will also headline the BST festival in London's Hyde Park two days before Glastonbury. Rodrigo last played the festival in 2022, drawing a huge - and noticeably young - crowd to the Other Stage. During that performance, she brought out Lily Allen to perform the expletive-laden track F You, dedicating it to the US Supreme Court justices who had, a day earlier, ended the constitutional right to abortion in America. Charli XCX will bring Brat to Worthy Farm Rumours that Rihanna would play the Pyramid Stage turned out to be wishful thinking for the second year running. But Charli XCX will cement her position as one of the UK's biggest pop stars with her set on the Other Stage. She returns to the festival after winning five Brit Awards for her deliberately trashy seventh album, Brat. Playing the Other Stage will release her from the requirement to tone down her set for audiences on BBC One, and indulge in the frenetic, hedonistic club sounds that made her name. \"The Other Stage is traditionally more of a home for electronic music,\" said Annie Mac on Sidetracked. \"It makes so much sense for her to counteract the Neil Young set on Saturday night.\" Charli's set also marks the latest step in the star's journey through Glastonbury's smaller stages, starting at the Silver Hayes dance arena in 2014. \"I was really ill and I forgot to wear a bra on stage, which was good!\" she later told the BBC about her debut..  \"[Radio 1 DJ] Huw Stephens came on during the last song and told me I was singing live on the radio. I lost my voice and it was all a bit crazy, but it was fun.\" Hopefully she'll avoid the lurgy this summer.  Rap pioneer Busta Rhymes will make his debut at the festival Other acts announced for Glastonbury 2025 include Ezra Collective, Jorja Smith, The Libertines, The Maccabees, Franz Ferdinand, Kae Tempest, Beabadoobee, Kneecap and The Prodigy. Pop star Raye will also play just before Neil Young on the Saturday night, following her breakthrough set at lunchtime on the Pyramid Stage just two years ago. The line-up so far includes: Friday 27 June The 1975 Loyle Carner Biffy Clyro Alanis Morissette Busta Rhymes Maribou State Gracie Abrams Four Tet Wet Leg Anohni & The Johnsons Badbadnotgood Blossoms Burning Spear Cmat Denzel Curry En Vogue English Teacher Fatboy Slim Faye Webster Floating Points Franz Ferdinand Glass Beams Inhaler Lola Young Myles Smith Osees Pinkpantheress Self Esteem Supergrass Vieux Farka TourÃ© Wunderhorse Saturday 28 June Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts Charli XCX Raye Doechii Deftones Ezra Collective John Fogerty Amyl & The Sniffers Amaarae Beabadoobee Beth Gibbons Bob Vylan Brandi Carlile Caribou Father John Misty Gary Numan Greentea Peng Jade Japanese Breakfast Kaiser Chiefs Kneecap Leftfield Lucy Dacus Nick Lowe Nova Twins Pa Salieu Scissor Sisters Tom Odell The Script TV On The Radio Weezer Yussef Dayes Sunday 29 June Olivia Rodrigo Rod Stewart The Prodigy Noah Kahan Nile Rodgers & Chic Wolf Alice Jorja Smith Overmono The Libertines AJ Tracey Black Uhuru Celeste Cymande Future Islands Girl In Red Goat Joy Crookes Kae Tempest Katy J Pearson Parcels Pawsa Royel Otis Shaboozey Snow Patrol Sprints St Vincent The Brian Jonestown Massacre The Maccabees The Selecter Turnstile More acts will be announced before the festival opens its gates on 25 June.

        "title": "New Zealand fires UK envoy Phil Goff over Trump comments",
        "content": "Goff's (pictured) comments were \"deeply disappointing\", Foreign Minister Winston Peters said New Zealand has fired its most senior envoy to the United Kingdom over remarks that questioned US President Donald Trump's grasp of history. At an event in London on Tuesday, High Commissioner Phil Goff compared efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which allowed Adolf Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia. Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: \"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?\" His comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said. His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week. He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats.  Mr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\" Peters said Mr Goff's views did not represent those of the New Zealand government. \"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying. \"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about. Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence. Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon. When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\" The 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government.  Luxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\".  Former Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goff's sacking, saying it was backed by a \"very thin excuse\". \"I have been at Munich Security Conference recently where many draw parallels between Munich 1938 and US actions now,\" she wrote in a post on X. Under the 1938 Munich Agreement, Hitler took control of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland. The deal failed to stop Nazi Germany from advancing deeper into Europe and World War Two began when he invaded Poland in 1939.

In Northern Iraq, Yazidi women and girls who have been the victims of brutal sexual enslavement and lost swathes of their family and community to genocide at the hands of IS, are finding an unusual way to heal - boxing. Since 2014, when ISIS began targeting Yazidis because of their religious identity, those who survived the genocide have been confined to internally displaced persons camps in the Kurdish region of Iraq. Here conditions are difficult and the women and girls still struggle to process all that has happened to them.

        "title": "Scientists discover new part of the immune system",
        "content": "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said. They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals. The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection. And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs. The discovery centres on the proteasome â a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body. Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones. But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, external, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria. It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them. Staphylococcus bacteria, one healthy on the left and one being destroyed as its outer layer is torn open by antimicrobials made by the proteasome.  Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening. \"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection. \"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\" The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics. They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics. And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.   Prof Yifat Merbl, centre in black, with the rest of her lab team Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection. \"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\" But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time. More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.  Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand. Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.  Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting. \"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\" She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\".

        "title": "Doctors back total ban on smacking children in England",
        "content": "Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing. Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\". Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament. The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life. Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\" If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England. Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK. In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the \"reasonable punishment\" defence still stands. In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860. Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022. Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so. The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage. A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the \"single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation\".  \"This government has prioritised significant reform of the children's social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,\" they added. Parents at a baby sensory group in Sale, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they were all against smacking children, but some were unsure about whether it was right for the government to intervene. Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\" Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\". Oli Harrison, pictured with his daughter Lily, said \"some kind of legislation\" would help provide clarity for parents When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\". He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children's wellbeing. Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif. Sara was murdered in August 2023 after a \"campaign of torture\" by her father and stepmother which lasted for two years. Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death. It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault. He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to \"draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal\". Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment. Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with \"depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour\". She said a legal change was needed \"urgently\", adding that \"right now we know physical punishment remains a part of childhood for too many young people in England\". Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors' calls. He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean \"a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand\" faces criminal prosecution. Lynn Perry, chief executive of the Barnardo's children's charity, said: \"No violence against children is acceptable. And yet children continue to face less legal protection against physical assault than adults.\" Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes and Hayley Clarke Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

        "title": "Home buyers race to beat stamp duty rise",
        "content": "Paul and Kate say the cost of buying a home is already tough to deal with Home buyers are scrambling to complete purchases by the end of the month or face paying thousands of pounds extra in stamp duty. First-time buyers in particular could be hit when stamp duty thresholds in England and Northern Ireland change on 1 April.   One couple said they felt like they were \"in a race, and our prize is Â£11,000\". Lenders say a significant swathe of the country will be drawn into paying the tax, but the government says it is helping more people to buy their first home. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 do not pay stamp duty land tax, but this will revert to Â£125,000 from 1 April. For most first-time buyers the threshold is currently Â£425,000, but this will fall back to Â£300,000 in April. The increases to the thresholds had been introduced during the September 2022 mini-Budget. Paul Gorton featured in the 2024 series of cult reality TV series The Traitors. The 37-year-old and his partner Kate Waldron now face another episode of high jeopardy to complete the purchase of their first home in time. \"We're on a knife edge, we've got weeks, otherwise it's going to cost us a large chunk for no reason,\" Mr Gorton said. They are trying to buy a property in Congleton, Cheshire. Ms Waldron, 34, said it was a particularly stressful time because she only gave birth to baby Cooper three months ago. They already have two-year-old Charlie and a dog called Buddy. \"We're doing it all at once. It's an added stress with this deadline looming over us,\" she said. Missing that deadline would cost them Â£6,500, despite having put all their money into the deposit, and facing the prospect of regular bills and nursery fees. What is stamp duty and how is it changing? The seven bills due to go up in April Karen Potter, an estate agent in Southport, has about 37 clients in the danger zone of missing the deadline. \"In a stressful arena anyway, we've got this panic where there's another source of strain and stress for them,\" she said. Property portal Rightmove has estimated that in England, some 25,000 first-time buyers and 74,000 home movers, in the buying process, would be unable to complete in time to beat the deadline. Mortgage brokers have reported buyers pulling out of deals because they could not move before the end of March. The proportion of areas in England in which the average first-time buyer home falls into the scope of stamp duty, external will rise from 8.4% to 32% on 1 April, according to analysis by the Skipton Group, which includes a building society and estate agency. Jonah and Elle are hoping to complete a purchase within days Stamp duty has always been a more common issue for buyers in the south east of England, where house prices are higher.  Some will face higher stamp duty bills owing to the changing thresholds, external, which include the first-time buyer relief being available only to those buying a property for less than Â£500,000, rather than less than Â£625,000. Jonah Kavanagh and Elle Van Petersen are hoping to buy their first home together in Guildford. They, and their sellers, are pulling out all the stops to get the move completed in time. Failure to do so would cost them Â£11,000 extra in stamp duty. \"It feels like we are in a race, and our prize is Â£11,000,\" said Mr Kavanagh, 29, who was one of those who got in touch on the issue via Your Voice, Your BBC News as he was worried about others in a similar situation. Ms Van Petersen said there was plenty of \"uncertainty, anxiety, and nervousness\" now on top of the shock that came when no extension to stamp duty relief was announced in the Budget. The government has previously said that Budget was a necessary package to fill what it called a black hole in the public finances, and other changes were freeing up properties for first-time buyers. \"We're committed to making home ownership possible for hardworking Brits, that's why we're fixing the planning system and building 1.5 million more homes,\" said a Treasury spokesman. For Mr Kavanagh and Ms Van Petersen the impact, were they to miss the deadline, would be less money and sensible savings to cover living costs, furniture, and unexpected costs. Are you buying a home and hoping to avoid the stamp duty rise? Please share your experience: Make overpayments. If you still have some time on a low fixed-rate deal, you might be able to pay more now to save later. Move to an interest-only mortgage. It can keep your monthly payments affordable although you won't be paying off the debt accrued when purchasing your house. Extend the life of your mortgage. The typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available.

        "title": "Worst train stations for cancellations named and shamed for first time",
        "content": "This is the first time the information will be proactively presented to passengers Millions of passengers will see train cancellation and delay data published prominently at more than 1,700 railway stations in England from Thursday. The data will update every 28 days showing statistics for the most recent month in a bid to increase transparency and to hold operators to account. The government says performance information will appear on large digital display boards, with smaller stations displaying QR codes for passengers to scan on smartphones. Ince and Elton in Cheshire was the worst performing station for cancellations in the four weeks to 1 February, according to data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR). The BBC understands that the data will not be announced audibly for people with print disabilities but the government says online data will be posted on a new portal which has been made accessible to screen reader users such as those who are blind and visually-impaired. The concept of publishing train reliability data is not new. The ORR publishes performance statistics which detail the percentage of services that are delayed or cancelled.  Between 1 October and 31 December 2024, some 5.1% of train services were cancelled and only 62.1% of services were on time, according to the ORR. However, this is the first time that potentially embarrassing information is being proactively presented to millions of train passengers in England each day. And it is the first time the ORR is publishing monthly figures on the worst performing stations for the whole of England, Wales and Scotland. Though the data covers all three countries, the Department for Transport only has the power to display it in English stations. The devolved Welsh and Scottish transport departments currently have no plans to display the figures in their stations. The data also reveals how individual train operators are performing at each station. Train operators say cancellations are not always in their control and that the ORR data does not reflect cases when operators plug a gap in their services with another train. Transport correspondent Sean Dilley shows how a screen at Reading train station details cancellations Ince and Elton (Cheshire) - 22.8% Gathurst - 16.2% Earlswood (Surrey) - 11.7% Birchgrove - 11.7% Rhiwbina - 11.7% Whitchurch (Cardiff) - 11.7% Salfords (Surrey) - 11.7% Arram - 10.7% Hartlepool - 9.9% Ellesmere Port -9.7% Source: Office of Rail and Road. Covers the period 5 January to 1 February As well as revealing the worst performers, the data also reveals that 33 stations of out of nearly 2,600 in England, Scotland, and Wales had no cancellations in the four-week period. Buckenham in Norfolk was the only station with a perfect score. It had no cancellations or unscheduled stops and all trains arrived on time or within three minutes, although only 100 trains stopped there in the month. Train user Charlotte thinks the rail industry needs to communicate better with passengers Travellers in Reading were generally supportive of having the data on display in the station, though questioned what it would achieve. \"I think it's a long time coming,\" said Charlotte from London. \"You need to have better communication.\" Rachel Alexander from Reading was keen to see the data display followed up with action. \"It would help if they're doing something about it to have less cancellations and have more trains,\" she said. The move has been welcomed by the independent passenger watchdog, Transport Focus. The group's director, Natasha Grice, told the BBC the railway needs to rebuild trust, and transparency around cancellations was part of that. \"Previously, performance information has tended to be available by route or a group of routes. This initiative makes the data more relevant to an individual passenger by showing the numbers for their station,\" she said. Jacqueline Starr, chair and chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train operators, said the move shows how serious the industry is about putting things right for customers frustrated by cancellations and delays. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC the policy was about creating \"a new era of accountability\". It is part of a wider overhaul of the country's railways under the government's planned return to nationalisation under Great British Railways. \"We need to be able to hold these operators to account before we take them into public ownership,\" she said. The government said Rail Minister Lord Hendy will be meeting with all train operators to \"address concerns and demand immediate action\". Do you commute by train? Share your experience.

        "title": "US confirms direct talks with Hamas over Gaza hostages",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has issued what he called a \"last warning\" to Hamas to release the hostages being held in Gaza. \"I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform. Hamas accused the US president of encouraging Israel to break the ceasefire deal currently in effect between the two sides. Trump's statement came just hours after the White House confirmed it was holding direct talks with Hamas over the remaining hostages. Washington has until now avoided direct engagement with the group, and there is a longstanding US policy against having direct contact with entities it lists as terrorist organisations. One day, three crises and Trump's free-wheeling foreign policy Gaza food prices spike after Israel halts aid deliveries Stories of the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel In his social media post, Trump said there would be \"hell to pay\" if the hostages were not released, while not specifying the nature of the support he was sending Israel. \"Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he added. \"For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance.\" He also appeared to issue a wider threat: \"Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that such threats \"complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation [Israel] to avoid implementing its terms\". It's not the first time Trump has threatened Hamas. In December, he said there would be \"all hell to pay\" if hostages were not released by the time he took office. The post came after Trump met with a group of hostages in the White House who had been recently released under the ceasefire. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US has been negotiating directly with Hamas to try to secure the release of the hostages. Israel had been consulted prior to the talks, she added. President Trump believed in doing what was in the best interest of the American people, Leavitt told reporters. The work of the special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, work was a \"good faith effort to do what's right for the American people\", she added. \"Two direct meetings\" have taken place between Hamas and a US official, \"preceded by several communications\", a Palestinian source told the BBC. News of the talks was first reported by Axios, external, which said the two sides were meeting in Qatar to discuss the release of US hostages as well as a wider deal to end the war. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,440 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says there are still 59 hostages being held in Gaza, with up to 24 believed to be alive.   Five US citizens are among the captives. One of them, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive and the other four are presumed dead. This video can not be played Watch: White House press secretary confirms US in talks with Hamas over hostages A former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be \"more proactive\" about getting its citizens back. Mick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that \"it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated\". Israel's prime minister's office said in a statement it has \"expressed its position\" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information. According to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks. Hamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration. The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia. Alongside the US and Egypt, Qatar has also played a major role in talks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

        "title": "Gardener wins £1M payout caused by software bug",
        "content": "Corrine Durber, with her husband Colin (left) and her solicitor Peter Coyle (right) outside the High Court A gardener who was told by Paddy Power her Â£1m jackpot from an online game was a computer error has vowed to \"enjoy retirement\" after a High Court judge ruled she was entitled to the entire sum. Corrine Durber, from Gloucestershire, played the Wild Hatter game in October 2020 - a two-part game involving a fruit machine and a wheel of fortune. After spinning the jackpot wheel, Mrs Durber's iPad Screen displayed she had won the \"Monster Jackpot\", which was stated as Â£1,097,132.71. But the gambling giant only paid out Â£20,265 telling her she had won the smaller \"Daily Jackpot\", with the difference attributed to a programming error with the game's display. Mrs Durber sued PPB Entertainment Limited, which trades as Paddy Power and Betfair, for breach of contract and for the rest of her winnings, based on what she was shown on screen. In a judgment on Wednesday, Mr Justice Ritchie granted summary judgment in her favour, meaning she won her case without a trial. He said: \"When a trader puts all the risk on a consumer for its own recklessness, negligence, errors, inadequate digital services and inadequate testing, that appears onerous to me.\" Speaking to ITV news, Mrs Durber said the money would be lifechanging for her family. \"Obviously it will look after the children, from that we'll pay their mortgages and we're going to enjoy our retirement,\" she said. Corrine Durber said she would never bet with Paddy Power again PPB had said that the outcome was determined by a random number generator, which had said she had only won the daily jackpot, but an error affected the animations of the game and showed her the wrong result. Mr Justice Ritchie said that the idea of \"what you see is what you get\" was central to the game. He continued in a 62-page ruling: \"Objectively, customers would want and expect that what was to be shown to them on screen to be accurate and correct. \"The same expectation probably applies when customers go into a physical casino and play roulette. \"They expect the house to pay out on the roulette wheel if they bet on number 13 and the ball lands on number 13.\" The judge found that the result from the random number generator was different from the result on screen due to human error in mapping the software, which had affected 14 plays over 48 days. Mrs Durber said she was \"relieved and happy\" that the judge had confirmed she won \"fairly and squarely\" Â£1m from Paddy Power. She added: \"But why couldn't Paddy Power pay-up straight away instead of putting me through this legal torment?\" Following the ruling, a spokesperson for Paddy Power, said: \"We always strive to provide the best customer experience possible and pride ourselves on fairness. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate case and are reviewing the judgment.\" More news stories for Gloucestershire Listen to the latest news for Gloucestershire Tell us which stories we should cover in Gloucestershire Follow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Aspirin: Scientists crack how painkiller might stop cancers from spreading",
        "content": "Scientists believe they have discovered how the cheap painkiller aspirin can stop cancers spreading. In animal experiments they showed the drug enhanced the ability of the immune system to fight back. The team at the University of Cambridge said it was an exciting and surprise discovery that could eventually lead to cancer patients being prescribed the drug - but not yet and people are advised against just taking the pills themselves. Regular aspirin comes with risks and trials are still trying to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit. Tantalising data from more than a decade ago, external showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer. But how? It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body.  This process is called metastasis and is the cause of the majority of deaths, external from cancer. Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.   But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer.  Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.    Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: \"What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells.\" He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread.  The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin.  \"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin,\" says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London. He says the study provided \"the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle\" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer. Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed. Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin, external. But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too.  These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial, external to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back.  She said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\". However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\". In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects. The discovery, published in the journal Nature, external, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin. The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread. They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread. Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body.  Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: \"It was a Eureka moment. \"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated.\" Boots recalls paracetamol over labelling error Warning over rapid at-home prostate tests Aspirin 'may prevent cancer in diabetes patients' Cancer family 'financially broken' by benefits wait Brain surgery took my childhood memories - will new op make me forget my fiance?

        "content": "The Prince of Wales visited NHS staff at the Royal Berkshire Hospital The Prince of Wales has suggested NHS staff should have enforced career breaks to aid their mental health. Prince William made the comment while visiting the Oasis Health and Wellbeing Centre and garden, at Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH) in Reading. He attended a meeting to hear how health workers coped with the pandemic and chatted to staff who were on the frontline. The prince told a small group of NHS staff who use the facility: \"Unless there's almost an enforced break in somebody's career - as part of your career development - we're never going to get to the point where we can look after their mental health.\" Prince William toured the gardens of the Oasis Health and Wellbeing Centre The RBH recorded the first person in the UK to die after testing positive for Covid-19, five years ago to the day on 5 March 2020. The prince - a former air ambulance helicopter pilot - visited the trust's centre in his role as patron of NHS Charities Together. The organisation has provided Â£380,000 in grants for various projects, including renovating the centre, which has a gym, yoga classes and a garden providing spaces for recreation, reflection and vegetable growing. It launched its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal in 2020 and raised Â£162m to support NHS staff, patients and communities, working with a network of 235 NHS charities, based in every trust and health board around the UK. The prince chatted to staff from the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust who were on the frontline during the pandemic Prince William listened as one senior nurse became emotional when he described not visiting his elderly parents in Italy for two years to protect them during the outbreak. \"Everyone in the NHS is there to care for others so the last person who gets looked after is the individual,\" the prince said. \"I've seen that when I've worked with doctors, nurses, paramedics - they always put it down the line, they don't want to put their workload on to someone else - how do you go around identifying the right people? \"For me, looking into the nation's mental health, if you like, over the last few years, unless there's almost an enforced break in somebody's career - as part of your career development - we're never going to get to the point where we can look after their mental health, because you always rely on the individual to put their hand up.\" Do you have a story BBC Berkshire should cover?

        "title": "China says it is ready for 'any type of war' with US",
        "content": "President Xi Jinping's China faces the prospect of a trade war with Donald Trump's US China has warned the US it is ready to fight \"any type\" of war after hitting back against President Donald Trump's mounting trade tariffs. The world's top two economies have edged closer to a trade war after Trump slapped more tariffs on all Chinese goods. China quickly retaliated imposing 10-15% tariffs on US farm products. \"If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,\" China's embassy said on X, reposting a line from a government statement on Tuesday.  It is some of the strongest rhetoric so far from China since Trump became president and comes as leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual National People's Congress.  LIVE: We answer your tariff questions What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? China targets 5% growth as it reels from Trump tariffs  On Wednesday, China's Premier Li Qiang announced that China would again boost its defence spending by 7.2% this year and warned that \"changes unseen in a century were unfolding across the world at a faster pace.\" This increase was expected and matches the figure announced last year. Leaders in Beijing are trying to send a message to people in China that they are confident the country's economy can grow, even with the threat of a trade war. China has been keen to portray an image of being a stable, peaceful country in contrast to the US, which Beijing accuses of being embroiled in wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. China may also hope to capitalise on Trump's actions relating to US allies such as Canada and Mexico, which have also been hit by tariffs, and will not want to ramp up the rhetoric too far to scare off potential new global partners. The Premier's speech in Beijing on Wednesday emphasised that China would continue to open up and hoped to attract more foreign investment. China has, in the past emphasised that it is ready to go to war. Last October, President Xi called for troops to strengthen their preparedness for war as they held military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan. But there is a difference between military preparedness and a readiness to go to war. Beijing is to increase military spending by more than 7% this year The Chinese embassy in Washington's post quoted a foreign ministry statement in English from the previous day, which also accused the US of blaming China for the influx of the drug fentanyl  \"The fentanyl issue is a flimsy excuse to raise US tariffs on Chinese imports,\" the foreign ministry spokesperson said. \"Intimidation does not scare us. Bullying does not work on us. Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China,\" he added. The US-China relationship is always one of the most contentious in the world. This post on X has been widely shared and could be used by the China hawks in Trump's cabinet as evidence that Beijing is Washington's biggest foreign policy and economic threat. Officials in Beijing had been hopeful that USâChina relations under Trump could get off to a more cordial start after he invited Xi to his inauguration. Trump also said the two leaders had \"a great phone call\" just a few days before he entered the White House. There were reports that the two leaders were due to have another call last month. That did not happen. Xi had already been battling persistently low consumption, a property crisis and unemployment. China has pledged to pump billions of dollars into its ailing economy and its leaders unveiled the plan as thousands of delegates attend the National People's Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament, which passes decisions already made behind closed doors. China has the world's second-largest military budget at $245bn but it is far smaller than that of the US. Beijing spends 1.6% of GDP on its military, far less than the US or Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. However, analysts believe China downplays how much it spends on defence.

        "title": "Zhenhao Zou: London student guilty of multiple counts of rape",
        "content": "This video can not be played Police enter Zhenhao Zouâs London flat in January 2024 and arrest him on suspicion of rape A PhD student who has been convicted of drugging and raping 10 women \"may turn out to be one of the most prolific sexual predators that we've ever seen in this country\", according to the lead detective on the case. Chinese national Zhenhao Zou, 28, attacked two women who have been identified and another eight who have yet to be traced, his trial at Inner London Crown Court heard. The University College London (UCL) student filmed nine assaults as \"souvenirs\", and kept a trophy box of victims' belongings including jewellery and clothing. Judge Rosina Cottage said Zou was a \"dangerous and predatory\" offender and warned him he faces a \"very long\" jail term when he is sentenced on 19 June. The Met Police has launched an appeal to find any more of Zou's potential victims The Met Police's Cdr Kevin Southworth said the video evidence showed there may be as many as 50 further victims, whom they are \"desperate to trace\". \"Such is the insidious nature of these offences, I think there is a possibility that many more victim survivors may not even know that he has, in fact, raped them,\" he said.  Following the trial and as a result of the media coverage, the Met confirmed that one woman had already been in touch about Zou. Zou kept a trophy box of victims' belongings As well as 11 counts of rape, Zou was found guilty of voyeurism, possession of extreme pornographic images and false imprisonment. The crimes he has been convicted of took place between 2019 and 2024. Hidden cameras were discovered by the Met Police in his bedroom, as well as ecstasy and an industrial chemical the human body turns into the \"date-rape\" drug GHB. 'Depraved and cowardly' rapist could have attacked 50 more women Seven of the rapes happened during the pandemic in China. The evidence of those attacks was videos shown to the jury that Zou kept of him having sex with unconscious and semi-conscious women. Police have never identified them. Four of the rapes took place in London. Two women were identified and gave evidence; the other two rapes were of the same woman, but she has never been tracked down. Zou filmed the women using spy-cameras Jurors had to watch footage of nine of the rapes during court proceedings, appearing visibly upset and being given regular breaks as the material was shown. Some of the attacks were filmed at his flats in Bloomsbury and Elephant and Castle, others at an unknown location in China. The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place. This video can not be played 'No comment': Video shows police interviewing Zhenhao Zou In his defence, Zou told the jury he had discussed sexual preferences with one of the women he filmed, and she had said she liked \"uniform role play\". \"We specifically discussed the kinds of role play I like, which was rape role play,\" he said. He told the court this was how the videos came to be made. Zou paid Â£4,000 a month to rent his luxury flat The student comes from a wealthy family, and had enough money to afford a Rolex watch, a wardrobe full of designer clothes and cosmetic procedures including a hair transplant and facial surgery. He paid Â£4,000 a month in rent. Zou moved to Belfast in 2017 to study at Queen's University before heading to London in 2019 to do a master's degree and then a PhD at UCL. The Met Police has launched an appeal to find any other victims. \"If you're a woman who's in any way had a one-on-one encounter with this man Zou, then we would like to hear from you,\" Cdr Southworth said. The force said it was particularly keen to hear from women from the Chinese student community who may have met Zou and were living in and around London between 2019 and 2024. The Met said it would also like to speak to potential victims who may have met Zou while he was living in China. Reports to the force can be made online via the Major Incident Public Portal, external. UCL president Dr Michael Spence said:â¯ \"We have been appalled by these horrific offences.  \"Our thoughts are with the survivors and we wish to pay tribute to the bravery of the women who reported these crimes and gave evidence at the trial.\" Saira Pike from the Crown Prosecution Service said: \"I'd like to express my heartfelt thanks to the courageous women who came forward to report Zhenhao Zou's heinous crimes.  \"They have been incredibly strong and brave â there is no doubt that their evidence helped us to secure today's verdict. \"Zou is a serial rapist and a danger to women.\" The jury found Zou guilty of: 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim Three counts of voyeurism 10 counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image One count of false imprisonment  Three counts of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence  He was cleared of two further counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image, and five counts of possession of controlled drugs to commit a sexual offence.

        "title": "Michael Sheen buys £1m worth of people's debts",
        "content": "As part of a new Channel 4 documentary, Michael Sheen has used Â£100,000 of his own money to write off Â£1m of people from South Wales' debts Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has written off Â£1m-worth of people's debts, using Â£100,000 of his own money. Sheen started a debt acquisition company to help 900 people in south Wales. It has been documented in a new Channel 4 show called Michael Sheen's Secret Million Pound Giveaway, external, due to air next week - five months after the closure of Port Talbot's last blast furnace, which marked the end of traditional steelmaking in south Wales. The show aims to reveal how some banks and finance companies profit from society's most vulnerable. Sheen said he did not have Â£100,000 to \"throw around\" and therefore wanted the project to be \"effective\". Despite initial doubts, an encounter with a woman in a Port Talbot cafe who shared the story of \"steelworkers in tears\" losing their jobs, convinced him to keep going.  Sheen to fund new national theatre for Wales Final curtain goes down on National Theatre Wales  It comes two months after Sheen announced he was funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales. In 2021, Sheen declared himself a \"not-for-profit\" actor, pledging to use all the money he earns for good causes.  The 56-year-old, who has starred in films such as Frost/Nixon and The Damned United, also sold his houses to make sure the 2019 Homeless World Cup went ahead in Cardiff.  Appearing on the One Show on Tuesday, the actor explained how exactly the system of debts work. It sees people's debts get put into a bundle, with a debt-buying company then able to buy those bundles at a lower price.  Despite the money being owed by people remaining the same, the companies that own the debt can then sell them for less and less money.  Sheen said he was able to set up a debt acquisition company with Â£100,000 of his own money to buy Â£1m worth of debt because it had come down in value. Although the system was \"bizarre\" and he initially had \"no idea\" how it worked, Sheen said \"it seemed like a good thing to do\".  The company was not set up in Sheen's name and he had to be at \"arm's length from it\". He did not know the identity of people's debts he paid off, he only knew where they lived and the kind of debt it was. Sheen added: \"I would never know who they are - I still don't know who they are.\" Sheen, from Port Talbot has performed in theatre venues across the world - including the Sydney Opera House During the making of the documentary, the process became far more complicated than he anticipated. \"I thought I would only work on this for a few weeks or a month or something, and it turned into two years, because we had to do it secretly,\" he said.  Sheen added that setting up the company took so long that at a one point he felt like he wasn't going to be able to keep doing it.  His mindset changed after filming in a cafe in his hometown of Port Talbot as the local steelworks prepared to close.  \"The woman who worked at the cafe we were filming in told me the story of the men sitting on every table in tears, who were losing their jobs,\" he said.  \"And I just thought - then, it really hits home, I just thought anything I can do [to help]\".  The hour-long documentary will air on Channel 4 on Monday 10 March - five months after the last remaining blast furnace was closed in Port Talbot - which brought an end to the traditional method of steelmaking in south Wales.  As a result, Tata Steel announced that 2,800 jobs were going to be cut which created uncertainty and stress for many families.  Currently, Sheen confirmed that he has helped 900 people with their debts across south Wales.  He added that due to the \"stigma\" around discussing money, some people might not even realise their debts have been paid off, and therefore he urged people to check their accounts.

        "title": "Co-op admits unlawfully blocking rival store openings",
        "content": "The Co-op has admitted breaching rules to prevent rival supermarkets from opening nearby more than 100 times. The UK's competition watchdog found Co-op had breached an order which limits supermarkets' ability to prevent nearby land being used by rival retailers across England, Scotland and Wales. Blocking other grocers from opening nearby hits competition between supermarkets and means shoppers have less choice when trying to get cheaper prices, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. A spokesperson for Co-op said: \"This is a matter we take very seriously, and we have taken all necessary action to ensure this issue is resolved and does not happen again.\" The Co-op admitted 107 breaches of the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010. It has re-written 104 agreements and agreed to resolve three others, the CMA said.  It released a list of the 107 locations, external and in an open letter to the Co-op, the CMA said it was \"concerned by the very large number of breaches\".  The Co-op's spokesperson added: \"As a business that is committed to operating fairly, we recognise this is extremely disappointing.\"  The Co-op owns almost 2,400 stores across the UK and holds a 5.2% market share in the UK's Â£190.9bn supermarket industry, according to the CMA. The chain said the number of breaches amounted to \"less than 2% of transactions\" across its property portfolio, which includes its supermarkets and funeral directors. Many of the UK's biggest supermarkets have also breached the land order in recent years, but not to the extent that Co-op was found to in the CMA's latest action. Last year Morrison's had the highest number of breaches of the order at 55. Tesco 23 breaches in 2020 Waitrose 7 breaches in 2022 Sainsbury's 18 breaches in 2023 Asda 14 breaches in 2023 Morrisons 55 breaches in 2023 Marks and Spencer 10 breaches in 2023 The order bans new restrictive covenants which prohibit land being used for a supermarket.  It also bans exclusivity arrangements which prevent landlords from allowing stores to compete with an existing supermarket which were over five years long. Daniel Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA said: \"Restrictive agreements by our leading retailers affect competition between supermarkets and impact shoppers trying to get the best deals.\" Lee Tiso, 57, from Scotland said the lack of choice where he lives means he struggles to shop around to save money. He said: \"I live in Lochgilphead, which is a remote area of the Argyll. Co-op and Tesco have small stores here. \"The nearest Aldi and Lidl are 40 miles away in Oban and the nearest Poundland or Home Bargains is on the outskirts of Glasgow and 68 miles away. \"We are forced to pay whatever Co-op charges.\" It's a similar issue for Maureen Loftus who moved to the Isle of Skye in Scotland. She said the only stores nearby are a Co-op supermarket, a Co-op convenience store and a Spar. \"I don't know why other supermarkets aren't here considering the consumer demand?\" she said. She added Tesco, Asda and Morrisons make daily deliveries to a small number of click and collect points on the island - but the \"slots are so in demand\" that to get an easy slot she has to travel to another village.  \"About 10,000 people live permanently on Skye and the number of visitors to the island is huge,\" she added. \"Many are in campervans, self catering accommodation or camping which means the Co-op regularly runs out of fresh foods by 16:00 during the holiday season.\" Rising food prices have put pressure on household budgets in recent years. Last month, on average, the cost of buying groceries was still 3.3% more expensive than it was a year ago. Campaigners argue it is ever more important for consumers to have the ability to choose between a number of retailers to get the best deals. People who cannot travel to large supermarkets rely on convenience stores and can end up paying far more.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: 'I am happy to be a European' - Jesse Eisenberg on becoming a Polish citizen US actor Jesse Eisenberg has been awarded Polish citizenship by President Andrzej Duda, after telling the story of the Jewish population during World War Two in his Oscar-winning film A Real Pain. Eisenberg wrote, directed and starred in the film, about two American cousins who travel to Poland to honour their grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, who was based on Eisenberg's own great aunt. He told the citizenship ceremony: \"While we were filming this movie in Poland, and I was walking the streets and starting to get a little more comfortable in the country, something so obvious occurred to me, which is that my family had lived in this place for far longer than we lived in New York. \"And of course, the history ended so tragically.\" Kieran Culkin won an Oscar on Sunday for playing Eisenberg's on-screen cousin in A Real Pain He continued: \"In addition to that tragedy of history is also the tragedy that my family didn't feel any connection any more to Poland, and that saddened me and confirmed for me that I really wanted to try to reconnect as much as possible. \"And I really hope that tonight in this ceremony and this amazing honour is the first step of me, and on behalf of my family, reconnecting to this beautiful country.\" Eisenberg was inspired to make A Real Pain after the death of his great aunt Doris at the age of 106 in 2019. She grew up in Poland but fled to the US in 1938. Other family members who remained in Poland were killed during the Holocaust. President Duda said: \"I am delighted that people from across the ocean acknowledge their heritage, recognise that their ancestors hail from the Republic [of Poland] and seek to forge a connection with our country.\" Eisenberg was nominated for an Oscar for writing the film, while his co-star Kieran Culkin won the award for best supporting actor.

        "title": "Fact-checking Donald Trump's speech to Congress",
        "content": "In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office. He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called \"appalling waste\" in government spending. BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims.  Trump said he inherited an \"economic catastrophe\" from Biden. This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics., external The International Monetary Fund estimates, external that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7. On rising prices, Trump added \"we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country\". Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed. The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office. Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s, external. Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he \"let the price of eggs get out of control\". Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US. Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024. The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (Â£780m) plan to help combat the issue. The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it.  The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them. Trump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud\" in federal government spending. No evidence has been provided for this figure. On its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, external, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings. However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published \"receipts\" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings. US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m. Speaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that \"as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded\". This is true. In February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol, external. This is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000. By comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden.  Numbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024, external. Trump has ordered US troops to patrol the southern border with Mexico  Continuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: \"Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States\". There is no evidence for a figure this high. Encounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US. It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated. A report published by the Office of Homeland Security, external last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million. It says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s. On US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: \"We've spent perhaps $350bnâ¦ and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\" BBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included. The US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank, external. It calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn. How much has the US given to Ukraine? Fact-checking Elon Musk's claims in the Oval Office The US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure. We have asked the White House where it comes from. Correction: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316. Additional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.

        "title": "Most areas in England to cut eating-disorder help for under-18s",
        "content": "Most areas in England are planning cuts to specialist eating-disorder services for children and young people this year, an analysis shows. Of the nation's 42 NHS integrated care boards, 24 are due to reduce spending for under-18s in 2024-25, once inflation is taken into account. Overall spending is due to go up by 2.9%, with budgets rising in the other areas, but the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), which carried out the analysis, said this was too little to cope with increased in demand. NHS England said improving care was \"vital\" and more action was being taken in the community to support young people before their condition became a crisis.  Spending had been increasing for a number of years but \"more work needs to be done\", an official added. Veronika, 20, has been struggling with an eating disorder for five years. \"Shrugged off\" by services in the past, she says cuts could be \"catastrophic\" for people like her. \"It will have a knock-on impact and people won't want to seek help even from their GP, even for physical-health monitoring,\" Veronika says. \"It will just spiral on and on. \"It is horrible living day in and day out with it. \"And if you are not seen quick enough, I know myself how quickly things can spiral in a matter of weeks or days. \"It is going to be tragic for some and just long and horrible for others\".  Eating-disorder services cover a range of different support, from therapy and counselling to crisis support and hospital treatment. But they were already underfunded, the RCPsych said, and it had had to ration care to the under-18s most affected. Last year, referrals went up by 13%. By the end of 2024, more than 6,000 under-18s were on waiting lists. And targets for routine and urgent waits are not currently being met. Dr Ashish Kumar, of the RCPsych, said: \"Eating disorders, in particular anorexia, have high rates of mortality yet are treatable conditions. \"And with the right care and support in a timely manner, most patients can make a full recovery.\" Tom Quinn, of the eating disorder charity Beat, said: \"We are extremely concerned at the prospect of funding cuts to children and young people's eating-disorder services.  \"These vital services are already on their knees.\" It comes after the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Eating Disorders warned \"woefully inadequate care\" meant lives were being lost and families torn apart.

        "content": "Volodymyr Zelensky says he is travelling to Saudi Arabia next week, where talks between Ukrainian and US officials aimed at ending the war will take place The Ukrainian president says he will work \"constructively\" with Trump to reach a \"fast\" and \"lasting\" peace Earlier, US envoy Steve Witkoff said the idea was to \"get down the framework for a peace agreement\" At a summit in Brussels, the Ukrainian president called on European leaders to support steps he's outlined for building a \"full and fair\" end to the fighting Meanwhile, Russia has repeated its opposition to European troops in Ukraine after any deal - saying it would be \"direct war\" Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 Edited by Nathan Williams Adam GoldsmithLive reporter Hugs and handshakes greeted Volodymyr Zelensky at a European summit\nin Brussels this morning, on a day when frosty relations with the US looked to\nbe thawing too. After a warm welcome, which included new packages of support for\nhis embattled country, the Ukrainian president asked his European allies to\nsupport the steps which he said would create a \"fair and lasting\npeace\" in Ukraine. This included a truce in the air and sea, as well as a release\nby Russia of Ukrainian prisoners. But Zelensky stressed that this peace must\nnot come at the \"cost of giving up Ukraine\". Meanwhile, constructive noises rippled across the Atlantic, as\nUS Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff suggested that US officials were planning\ndiscussions with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia next week. Witkoff said the idea was to \"get down the framework for a\npeace agreement\", and Donald Trump later confirmed that these talks are\nplanned, and suggested that both Russia and Ukraine want to make a deal. Vladimir Putin, though, remains staunchly opposed to any\npeacekeeping force that might be a part of such an agreement - his foreign\nministry says this would \"lead to an extremely dangerous escalation\". That brings our live coverage of Ukraine to an end for tonight\nyou can continue to read more in our main story. Our Europe editor has taken a look at how European leaders are reacting to changed world order. We have also reported on the countries said to be willing to join a \"coalition of the willing\" to help Ukraine. Thanks for following us and good night. The British government has struck a deal with a defence company, allowing Ukraine armed forces to use more advanced attack drones in the Black Sea.  In a Ministry of Defence statement, it says contracts amounting to almost Â£30m will see Anduril UK supplying Ukraine with drones designed to monitor an area before striking targets that enter it. Defence Secretary John Healey met staff from the company at its Washington DC facility ahead of the deal. The deal follows a meeting of world leaders in London last week, when the prime minister and allies agreed to help support Ukraine militarily.  Ukraineâs armed forces will take delivery of the drones, launchers and spare parts over the coming months.  Ukraine's defence minister says the country is working on alternatives to the US intelligence that they used to receive, but was paused.  Speaking at a press conference in Berlin earlier, Rustem Umerov told reporters that: \"We did not get the detail yet on how it will be restricted, but we already working for the alternatives.\"  We're just hearing news of another drone attack in Ukraine.  According to Odesa's regional governor Oleh Kiper, Russian forces launched a new mass drone attack on the Black Sea region late this evening.  \"On the outskirts of Odesa, three private homes are on fire\nand energy infrastructure has been damaged,\" Kiper writes on social media. Last night, four people were killed when a Russian missile hit a hotel in Kryvyi Rih, President Zelensky's home town, amid a score of attacks on the country that left a further four dead. We can bring you some more comments from Donald Trump in the Oval Office.  Asked about Macron's comments that France might extend its nuclear umbrella over its European partners, Trump replies that he favours \"denuclearisation\" instead. \"We've made a lot of progress with Ukraine and a lot of progress with Russia over the last couple of days and it would be great to bring that to an end so we don't have to talk that way about nuclear,\" he says. And, the US president reiterated his stance that European partners need to step up defence spending, when questioned on whether he might withdraw US funding from Nato. \"It's common sense right, if they don't pay Iâm not going to defend them,\" he says.  Trump also says he is \"looking at that\" when questioned on rumours that the temporary legal status of 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US may be revoked. He adds: \"We're not looking to hurt them, especially Ukrainians, they've gone through a lot.\" Donald Trump has shared his thoughts on talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. \"I think Ukraine wants to make a deal because they donât have a choice,\" he tells reporters in the Oval Office. \"I also think that Russia wants to make a deal because in a certain different way - a different way that only I know - they have no choice either.\" As we reported earlier, a US delegation is currently planning to meet Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.  And, the US president was asked whether he would also be visiting the country to meet with Vladimir Putin.  \"I donât know, I canât tell you,\" he responds, before adding: \"Iâm going to Saudi Arabia.\" Macron welcomed Putin to his summer home in August 2019 The Russian foreign ministry has released a strongly-worded statement criticising French President Emmanuel Macron's comments, which we covered in a previous post It calls Macron's Wednesday night address \"extremely aggressive\" and \"anti-Russian\" and says the deployment of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine would \"inevitably lead to an extremely dangerous escalation\".  The ministry also claims Macron's openness to discuss extending its nuclear protection to other European nations shows \"Paris' ambitions to become the nuclear 'patron\" of all of Europe,\" calling it \"nuclear blackmail\".  He says the absence of security guarantees for Russia, threats from the West through the \"unrestrained expansion of Nato\" and a \"desire to turn Ukraine into an anti-Russian bridgehead\" is what led to the current crisis - referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Zelensky's trip to Saudi Arabia on 10 March is a pre-planned visit. The Ukrainian president was originally scheduled to meet top Saudi officials last month - but he decided to postpone his trip due to the US-Russia talks that took place on 18 February, when Kyiv was not invited.  Zelensky has now confirmed Ukrainian negotiators will hold talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia after his planned meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman next week.  This video can not be played Watch: Zelensky's letter to Trump 'positive first step' - Witkoff Earlier we heard from the US's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff about the plans to meet with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia to discuss a \"framework\" for peace. Witkoff says he hopes \"we get things back on track with the Ukrainians and everything resumes\". He also says Trump's viewed Zelensky's letter as a \"very positive first step\" and the message included an apology and \"sense of gratitude\" from the Ukrainian leader.  More now from the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who says Ukraine will work \"constructively\" with President Trump to reach a \"fast\" and \"lasting\" peace.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukrainian negotiators will meet US officials in Saudi Arabia next week.  \"Next Monday, I have a visit planned to Saudi Arabia for a meeting with the Crown Prince. After that, my team will stay in Saudi Arabia to work with our American partners,\" he says in a post on social media. Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent The conclusions on defence reached at the summit in Brussels today were unanimously agreed by the 27 leaders.  A statement on the European Council's website says: \"The European Union will accelerate the mobilisation of the necessary instruments and financing in order to bolster the security of the European Union and the protection of our citizens.\" We havenât yet got the text on Ukraine, which is thought Hungaryâs Viktor Orban did not sign. The other 26 leaders reportedly did.  Nick BeakeEurope Correspondent Weâve seen a copy of the conclusions reached by all 27 EU leaders on boosting defence spending across the continent.  The document has not yet been officially published but in it the leaders back plans to loosen rules on spending limits so that individual countries can plough more cash and investment into their military and defence manufacturing.  The leaders also agreed they want to look at plans put forward by the European Commission this week for loans of up to 150 billion euros for member states to this end.  They also welcomed moves for the European Investment Bank and private investors to help EU countries invest in defence. This video can not be played Following a summit of 18 world leaders on Sunday, Starmer said the UK and France would lead efforts to create a \"coalition of the willing\". Although we do not have details on the countries involved, Starmer said the UK would back its commitment with \"boots on the ground, and planes in the air\". The prime minister also said the coalition would defend a deal in Ukraine and guarantee peace. British officials released an update today saying around 20 countries are reportedly interested in becoming part of the group.  More now from Volodymyr Zelensky, who describes his talks with French President Emmanuel Macron where they discussed security guarantees today. He says he spoke with Macron about an upcoming meeting where they will discuss  \"the level of military representatives\" willing countries might offer \"to ensure reliable security\" for Ukraine. The Ukrainian president says in a social media post that he also thanked Macron for recognising \"the need for new, more substantial steps to protect our entire Europe\".  As we've been reporting, there have been discussions about European commitments to bolstering Ukrainian security. This has involved discussion over Keir Starmer's so-called 'coalition of the willing' - with British officials reporting that 20 countries are already interested in being involved. We can now bring you a few lines from the UK's Defence Secretary John Healey. Speaking to reporters, Healey says he came to America to \"strengthen\" the defence \"bond\" between the US and UK. His US counterpart Pete Hegseth says the media is interested in \"narratives\" around Ukraine and Russia but Donald Trump is interested in peace. The UK's Defence Secretary John Healey has just arrived at the\nPentagon to meet with his US counterpart Pete Hegseth.  Healey stepped out of\nthe car and was greeted by Hegseth at the steps of the US defence department building.  The Trump administration's Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff says he is trying to organise a meeting with a Ukraine delegation in Saudi Arabia to discuss a peace \"framework\".  âWe are now in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians in Riyadh or maybe Jeddah, but it will be Saudi Arabia,\" he tells reporters in Washington DC. âI think the idea is to get down the framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well.â That's after we just reported that Volodymyr Zelensky told the European Council that Ukraine hopes to have a \"meaningful meeting\" with the US next week. Danny AeberhardEurope regional editor, BBC World Service Displays of solidarity for Ukraine are nothing new at European summits. But they're likely a welcome relief for President Zelensky, who is attending today's summit in Brussels, especially after his recent bruising experiences in Washington.  He has thanked European leaders for showing that his country was \"not alone\", but he needs action. And these leaders know they're facing a crisis that feels existential for the bloc, as well as Ukraine.  With President Trump's radical shift of US foreign policy and the threat from Russia, they speak of a watershed, in terms of Europe taking responsibility for its own security.  It remains to be seen whether they can deliver.  Meanwhile, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK - its former commander-in-chief, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi - has accused the US of destroying the world order.  The comments may re-ignite a row with Washington that Zelensky has been trying to douse. Russia, no doubt revelling in the splits, continues to reassert its own, unmodified maximalist goals.  Myroslava PetsaBBC News Ukrainian, reporting from Brussels Ukraine and the United States have âresumed workâ and hope to have a âmeaningful meetingâ next week, Volodymyr Zelensky has told the European Council summit.

        "title": "Six takeaways from Trump's big speech",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Key moments from Trumpâs first address to Congress US President Donald Trump declared \"the American Dream is unstoppable\" as he addressed a raucous joint session of Congress for the first time since he returned to power. In the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, he outlined his vision for his second term, as Republicans applauded a high-octane six weeks that has reshaped domestic and foreign policy. Trump was heckled by Democrats and he goaded them in turn during the rowdy primetime address, during which he said his administration was \"just getting started\". The Republican president has moved to slash the federal workforce and crack down on immigration, while imposing tariffs on the US's biggest trading partners and shaking up the transatlantic alliance over the war in Ukraine. Here are six of the key takeaways. Following a second day of market turbulence, Trump played down the potential economic fallout from a trade war he ignited this week, including 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. But in contrast with the ovations that greeted his other policy objectives, many Republicans remained seated, a sign of how Trump's import taxes have divided his party. \"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again,\" he said. \"And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.\" Trump added that reciprocal tariffs tailored to US trading partners would \"kick in\" on 2 April. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business that Trump could announce a trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday. Trump will 'probably' cut tariffs, says commerce chief What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them? Trump said he had received an \"important letter\" from Ukraine's leader earlier in the day, which appeared to match what Volodymyr Zelensky posted publicly on social media. Ukraine's president had said he was now ready to work under Trump's \"strong leadership\" to end the war and \"come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer\". \"I appreciate that he sent this letter,\" Trump told lawmakers. Zelensky offered the olive branch a day after Trump paused all military aid to the beleaguered US ally. It followed an acrimonious Oval Office meeting last week when the two leaders argued in front of TV cameras, before cancelling plans to sign a minerals deal that would allow the US to profit from an economic partnership involving Ukraine's natural resources. Trump was reportedly hoping to announce during his speech to Congress that the  deal had finally been sealed. But it did not materialise. Live updates: Trump 'appreciates' Zelensky's message Trump and Zelensky's fraying relationship, in their own words Despite most of his 99-minute speech focusing on domestic issues, Trump's worldview also came more sharply into focus. There are places in the world he wants to expand US influence and others where he wants to withdraw. Repeating his desire for the US to acquire Greenland, he vowed \"we're going to get it - one way or the other\". And he said his administration would \"reclaim\" the Panama Canal. There were several mentions of African countries when he rattled through a long list of aid programmes funded by US taxpayers that he portrayed as ridiculous. Liberia, Mali, Mozambique and Uganda were all places where he suggested money had been wasted. But his most pointed remark was about Lesotho, which he said was a country \"nobody has ever heard of\" despite receiving $8m (Â£6.2m) to promote LGBT rights. The government there quickly responded.  \"To my surprise, 'the country that nobody has heard of' is the country where the US has a permanent mission,\" Foreign Affairs Minister Lejone Mpotjoane told the BBC.

The tech mogul's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) taskforce has moved to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cut billions of dollars in foreign aid and slash programmes across the US government. The SpaceX and Tesla boss, wearing a dark suit with a blue tie, stood and acknowledged the cheers from the crowd. \"Thank you, Elon,\" the 78-year-old president said. \"He's working very hard. He didn't need this.\" Musk's cuts have sparked some angry scenes at town hall meetings and his instructions to federal employees have at times been overruled by members of Trump's cabinet. In the chamber, Democratic lawmakers held up signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"false\". Doge claims to have saved $105bn already, but that figure can't be independently verified. Receipts have been published for $18.6bn worth of savings, but accounting errors have been reported by US media outlets that have analysed the figures. Young Republicans cheer Trump on from Texas watch party This video can not be played Watch: Congressman Al Green ejected from chamber after disrupting Trump speech Within the first five minutes of the address, Al Green of Texas was escorted out of the chamber by the sergeant-at-arms after refusing to comply with the House Speaker's demands that he stop heckling the president and take his seat. As Trump spoke, other Democrats held up signs saying: \"This is a lie.\" With Republicans in control of the White House, House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats have been largely leaderless as they work to hone their message and counter the blitz of activity from the Trump administration. Many Democratic women arrived in the House chamber wearing pink pantsuits in protest. Dozens from their party - some of them wearing the words \"Resist\" printed on the backs of their shirts - exited the chamber during the speech. \"There is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy,\" Trump said, appearing to revel in the partisan rancour. Democratic leadership chose Elissa Slotkin of Michigan - a first-term senator elected in a battleground state that Trump won in November - to deliver the party's official response. She accused Trump of an \"unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends\" and warned that \"he could walk us right into a recession\". This video can not be played Watch: 'Country is going through something' - Elissa Slotkin delivers rebuttal to Trumpâs speech Trump pledged to voters that he would beat inflation on his return to office and he used the speech to say his focus would be to reduce the cost of energy, by opening up the country to new oil and gas drilling. \"We have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far, and now I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.\" The soaring cost of eggs has been headline news in recent weeks, and Trump made clear who he felt was responsible. \"Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control - and we are working hard to get it back down,\" he added. Egg prices rose as the Biden administration directed millions of egg-laying birds to be culled last year amid a bird flu outbreak, though prices have continued rising during the early stages of Trump's second presidency. Inflation was slightly elevated at 3% last month, but way down from its peak of 9.1% in 2022. Only one in three Americans approve of Trump's handling of cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey on Tuesday.

        "title": "Prostate cancer: Rapid at-home PSA tests spark concerns",
        "content": "At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found. The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood. Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample. Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their \"questionable accuracy\" and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results. There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, external, or from 45 for higher risk groups. That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen. A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease. PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer. Of the five tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative but one (left) returned a clear positive result Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024. Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels. They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from Â£6 to Â£95. They come in two main types: tests in which a blood sample is taken at home and posted to a private laboratory for analysis rapid tests which give a result in minutes and display a dark line if PSA is detected above a certain level The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day. The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\". Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules. Others are sold to \"monitor prostate health\" or identify \"potential prostate issues early\". One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked \"for professional use only\". Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer What are the symptoms of prostate cancer? I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy  For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.  A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette. Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l. A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l. \"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK. \"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\" Online reviews appear to bear that out. In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal. In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer. The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\". Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP. Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher, says patients \"may not get the  full picture\" from at-home PSA tests In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history. Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative. \"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds. \"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\" Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\". \"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity. Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing. The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries. Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward. A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year. \"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added.

        "title": "Treasury earmarks billions in spending cuts ahead of Spring Statement",
        "content": "The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had Â£9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. Analysis: Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs.  \"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes,\" a government insider told the BBC. \"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\" Insiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training. \"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added. Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent Â£65bn on sickness benefits, external - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around Â£100bn before the next general election. Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourage some to \"game the system\".  People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work. Steve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\". Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments The seven bills due to go up in April What is the OBR and why does it matter? The chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\". \"Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks,\" an insider told the BBC. This week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China.  Trump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves has told the BBC that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation. Uncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid. In the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings. It is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast. But there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy.  Inflation, which measures the rate of price rises over time, is expected to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills.

While the\npresident may have hoped he would be able to announce a mineral deal with\nUkraine, the best he could do was read a conciliatory letter from Volodymyr\nZelensky that the Ukrainian president had posted on X hours earlier. And with a tariff\nwar between the US and its biggest trading partners looming, the president\nappeared to be sticking to his guns â but gave no firm indications either way. In the end,\nTrumpâs speech may be most remembered for his partisan needling of Democrats in\nthe audience, and their icy, sign-waving reactions.  Much like\nthe first month of Trumpâs presidency, there was plenty in Trumpâs address to\nCongress for his supporters to love, and lots for his critics â those, at\nleast, who tuned in â to jeer. We're finishing up our live coverage for the night, but there's plenty more to read across the BBC. Congressman Al Green's protest on the House floor \"was unhelpful\", former Democratic Representative Stephanie Murphy tells the BBC. \"But he doesn't represent the entire Democratic party\", she adds. \"Elissa Slotkin, who was chosen to provide the rebuttal, is the person that the Democratic party wants to present,\" she says. Green was removed from the chamber early in Trump's speech, after he stood and shouted at the President while waving a gold-tipped cane. He later told reporters he was yelling at Trump about Medicaid - the health insurance program for the poor that Democrats and many others fear Trump will cut. You can read about his exit and the other ways Democrats protested through signs and wardrobes in our earlier coverage. This video can not be played Watch: BBC Verify looks into Trump's claims of government waste By Lucy Gilder Speaking about Bidenâs record on immigration earlier in his speech, Trump said âthere were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of themâ¦were released into our countryâ. Itâs true that hundreds of thousands of border crossings were recorded each month under Biden. In December 2023, Border Patrol recorded 249,740 crossings, external at the southwest border, the most ever recorded in a single month. While thereâs no evidence that âvirtually allâ of these migrants were released into the US, the majority were, albeit with some conditions. Of the peak crossings recorded in December 2023, for example, the majority - nearly 192,000 - were released from custody subject to conditions such as having to appear before an immigration court.  About 39,000 of the total were transferred to another type of government custody and more than 19,000 were returned to their home country.  For more analysis on Donald Trump's address to Congress, the BBC World Service's Global News podcast has an extra edition going in-depth on what the president said. You can listen along here. Lisa LambertReporting from Washington DC This video can not be played 'Country is going through something' - Elissa Slotkin delivers rebuttal to Trumpâs speech Compared to Trump's nearly two-hour address that featured cheers and jeers,  celebrations of invited guests, and an itemized list of now-slashed government spending, Senator Elissa Slotkin's rebuttal on behalf of Democrats was instead solemn and simple. She stayed on brand for key issues to Democrats, for example saying that the US is put at risk when Trump \"demonizes those are different and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.\" She also praised unions and higher taxes on billionaires - both key issues for Dems. But some of her remarks - delivered in front of a background of American flags - seemed aimed at moderates or Republicans disaffected with Trump. She took aim at the world's richest man, Elon Musk, saying he was combing through Americans' private information with a \"gang of 20-year-olds\" from his White House team known as Doge.  And she called for \"fixing our broken immigration system,\" a message which could appeal to Republicans. Most strikingly, she invoked Ronald Reagan, who is still revered by many Republicans as a great president two decades after his death.  \"Iâm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s,\" she said. \"Trump would have lost us the Cold War.\" The role of the rebuttal is to give an alternative view to what the president has just presented. \"Iâm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before,\" she said. \"And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.\" We've been hearing some analysis of Trump's speech from Zhanna Bezpiatchuk, from the BBC's Ukrainian service. Speaking to BBC News, she says she thinks \"Ukrainians didn't get any answers\" from Trump's speech. Bezpiatchuk says the president didn't give \"any clear vision\" of what he means by \"peace\", or mention anything about \"any security guarantees for Ukraine\" or \"whether he is ready to resume\" military aid. \"It's a very tough moment for Ukraine,\" she says. Oklahoma Republican Congresswoman Stephanie Bice spoke to BBC News moments ago, when she gave us her reaction to Trump's speech.  She began by praising Trump's recent policies, saying that tariffs will \"level the playing field\". \"Its not fair that some countries are taxing US goods,\" she says, adding that Trump is showing that \"we can't be taken advantage of any longer\". She says Trump's tariffs are necessary to bring other countries \"to the table\" to re-negotiate trade arrangements. She goes on to praise Trump's economic approach. \"Doge is reining in wasteful spending,\" she continues, talking about Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, adding that Trump will also bring down the costs of food and fuel. New York Democrat Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez - who skipped Trump's address - is giving her response to the speech live on Instagram.  \"This was not Trump's best speech,\" she says, adding that he \"rambled a lot\" and presented \"a lot of wrong information\".  One of the things he did not address, she says, is Medicaid.  Medicaid is a key issue among Democrats, who fear Trump plans to cut the insurance programme which helps millions of low-income and other Americans pay for healthcare.  \"Donât you find it interesting that Trump didnât mention Medicaid once?\" she says to her viewers, saying that much of the information the president presented is meant to distract from his administration's plans for the programme.  \"Republicans are coming for your Medicaid,\" she says.  Trump has said he has no plans to cut Medicaid, though he has endorsed a House budget proposal which calls for cuts which could target social programmes such as Medicaid. By Nick Eardley and Shayan Sardarizadeh Let's turn back to a line from President Trump during his speech. He repeated his unsubstantiated claim that the US has provided $350bn in aid to Ukraine. \"We've spent perhaps $350bnâ¦ and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is.\" BBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trumpâs $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included.  The US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank.  They calculate that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn. Their figure for Europe includes aid directly from the European Union, but also from bilateral deals from European countries, both inside and outside the EU. It includes military, financial and humanitarian aid. [The US Department of Defense has also done a calculation, which looks at a broader range of US military activity in Europe and includes replenishing defence stocks. Its figure is $182.8bn - still considerably less than the figure the president has mentioned.] We asked the White House where their figure had come from, but we haven't had an answer.

This video can not be played 'Country is going through something' - Elissa Slotkin delivers rebuttal to Trumpâs speech \"We all know that our country is going through something\nright now,\" Slotkin says, wrapping up her rebuttal. \"Weâre not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the\nnext decade.\" But \"this isn't the first time\" and \"we've gone through periods of political instability before\", she adds.  \"Ultimately we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.\" She says what's needed in these situations are \"engaged citizens\" and \"principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it\".  \"I promise that I, and my fellow\nDemocrats, will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that\nyou deserve,\" she says. Slotkin, delivering the Democratic rebuttal to Trump's speech, then pivots to one of Trump's favourite talking points, and an area where Democrats typically perform worse in the polls - immigration. \"As someone who spent my whole career\nprotecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming\nacross its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that,\" she says. \"But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration\nsystem is dealing with the symptom, not the disease.\" Trump spent much of his address tonight celebrating his administration's border work. Slotkin says: \"America is a nation\nof immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy,\nthat allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to\nthe Presidentâs plan on that.\" \"As a Cold War kid, Iâm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in\nthe 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War,\" Slotkin, a Democrat, says.  \"I would rather have American\nleadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week,\" she says. Ronald Reagan remains highly popular with Republicans, 20 years after his death, and many look to his presidency as a time when the US flourished. Focusing on the White House team headed by Elon Musk known as Doge (for Department of Government Efficiency), Slotkin asks: \"Is there anyone in America who\nis comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer\nservers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your\nbank accounts?\" \"No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails\non what they do with your private data,\" she says. Slotkin concedes that \"we need a more efficient government... but change doesnât need to be chaotic or make us less safe.\" Elissa Slotkin, a Senate Democrat from Michigan, is in front of a backdrop of American flags. She turns to what many Americans say they care most about and an issue that helped Trump win the White House: the economy. \"The president talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print,\" she warns. She points to the new tariffs Trump imposed on goods from US neighbours roughly 24 hours ago, and the retaliatory tariffs Canada has since put in place.  They will start trade war and hurt manufacturing, she adds. \"The national debt is going to go up, not down, and if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.\" Slotkin starts by saying she is \"honoured\" to have the opportunity to speak tonight, and promises to be shorter than the president's speech. She starts by introducing herself and her life so far. Slotkin says the election \"made it clear that prices are too high\nand that government needs to be more responsive\" to people's needs. \"But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And,\nwe can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a\ndemocracy,\" she says. \"So that's what I'll lay out tonight.\" Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin is now giving the Democrats' response to Trump's congressional address. You can watch her speech live on the top of this page.  We'll bring you all the top lines, stick with us.  Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the Capitol This video can not be played In his speech, Donald Trump referenced the attempt on his life at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on 13 July. It became a major part of his speeches going into the November election and he often has spoken of it in religious terms. \nAt a campaign rally that day, a gunman - later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania - opened fire from a rooftop overlooking the rally, shooting Trump in the ear and leaving one man dead and two wounded.\nThe aftermath of the chaotic incident ultimately led to the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle, the director of the Secret Service.\nTrump's new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, was also there that day, and was pictured rushing on stage to protect the then-candidate. Trump acknowledged Curran in his speech tonight.\nI was in Butler that day, and many people I met there told me their support for the president was strengthened in the aftermath Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "content": "Northamptonshire Police said it believed the victim was 43-year-old mother-of-three Marta Bednarczyk A 13-year-old girl has been charged with murdering a woman whose body was found following a house fire. Police said the woman's body was discovered at the address in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in the early hours of Monday morning. Officers said the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had also been charged with arson with intent to endanger life. Formal identification was yet to be confirmed, but detectives believed the victim was 43-year-old mother-of-three Marta Bednarczyk. A post-mortem investigation gave the preliminary cause of death as a result of a sharp force injury. Police and firefighters attended the house in Newcomen Road shortly after 03:00 GMT following reports of the blaze. The victim was declared dead at the scene at 03:29. A scene guard remains in place and police are asking people to avoid the area. Det Ch Insp Johnny Campbell, senior investigating officer from the East Midlands special operations unit, said he wanted to thank officers and staff who had worked \"tirelessly\" since the \"very tragic events\". \"And, in particular, all our thoughts are with Marta's family who have been fully co-operative throughout what has been a devastating couple of days for them.\" The force said the girl was due to appear at Northampton Magistrates' Court at 10:00 on Wednesday.

        "content": "More than 5,000 people who should have been offered cancer or other types of routine screening did not receive invitations because of an error dating as far back as 2008, NHS England says.  Those affected have now been notified and given details of a dedicated helpline for support.  About 10 people are thought to have since died, but it is not clear whether any screening could have prevented those deaths.  The screening included checks for possible cervical, breast and bowel cancer, as well as abdominal aortic aneurysm. The error first came to light in 2024, when some people contacted the health service to say they had not received invitations. The issue was caused by cases where patients' GP registration process hadn't been fully completed by practices, meaning their details did not flow through to NHS screening IT systems to invite eligible people for routine screening.  NHS England believes a total of 5,261 people have been affected.  Steve Russell, NHS national director for vaccinations and screening, said: \"This issue has now been fixed and everyone affected will be offered support and any catch-up screening as soon as possible, including where they may now be above screening age. \"We would like to extend our sincere apologies to those affected for this error and any additional worry this may have caused.  \"Anyone who is concerned they may have missed an invitation to screening can call our dedicated helpline for support and further information.\" Around 15 million people are invited to NHS screening every year.  NHS England says it has issued guidance to GP Practices and Integrated Care Boards to make sure all patient registrations are fully completed, and has put in place new measures to ensure all eligible people are invited for screening. Anyone in this group that is no longer eligible for screening will be able to have their screening if they choose to opt in.  Details of how to do this are set out in the letters that have been sent to those affected. Did you miss out on an NHS screening due to the admin error? Tell us your story.

        "title": "Trump is no longer swayed by the stock markets",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: How Trumpâs stock market rhetoric has shifted over the years On the day of the US presidential inauguration I was told by a top US tech chief executive that although he was likely to be hit by retaliatory tariffs, he assumed any trade war would die down.  \"Trump lives by the Dow Jones' reaction,\" he said - something markets call the \"Trump put\". This means that whenever a White House announcement that damaged sentiment came out, the president would row back after seeing a stock market fall. Those assumptions have now changed, after the president gave a TV interview in which he downplayed how much he was moved by markets. And only a day after US stock markets fell sharply on worries over the impact of Trump's policies, the president said he was going to double tariffs against Canada on steel and aluminium, in response to higher charges for Canadian electricity, worth about $100 per bill, in New York, Minnesota and Michigan - although he later halted that plan after Ontario suspended those charges. President Trump has said he is rebuilding wealth based on decades or even a century into the future, and this cannot be measured in the quarterly results of America's stock market giants. Alongside comments from his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the White House was communicating to markets that the president now has some tolerance for short-term market and economic pain. This has changed the calculus. There are another two factors at play here. There is evidence of actual potential reversal in the US economic sentiment, raising questions about a recession. The very latest real-time analysis by the Atlanta branch of the US Federal Reserve predicts a falling US economy in the first three months of the year. Government cuts could also contribute to such a reading, but private sector sentiment has taken a hit too, especially by the hokey cokey over tariffs. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Trump halts plan for 50% steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada Above all, the uncertainty threatens to be crippling. The policies change by the day, and even then can get retrospectively paused. Key US government departments are not entirely clear on the direction of travel in the White House. On top of all of this, in the case of Canada, a likely election suggests little incentive to compromise.  Indeed, what is there to compromise with when Trump says he wants to use economic leverage to make his northern neighbour his \"51st State\"? The direction of travel here is for the trade war to escalate in intensity and scope. New trade barriers on the European Union may emerge in three weeks' time based on \"reciprocity\". As other nations see signs of inflation re-emerging in the US, they will be more likely to try to add to it, to bring home to US consumers the consequences of the decisions of their government. In the past fortnight the world has learnt that President Trump is serious about tariffs, even on his allies. They have been applied in a huge way. Key trade partners have reciprocated in kind and have an incentive to up the ante. And the White House now wants to communicate it has a high pain threshold for short-term economic and market disruption. All roads lead to 2 April and the announcement on \"reciprocal tariffs\", and for now these tensions do not appear to be heading for a truce, ceasefire or pause.

        "content": "An annual injection designed to guard against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has completed an important early safety trial, researchers report in The Lancet, external medical journal.  Lenacapavir stops the virus from replicating inside cells.  If future trials go well - now it has passed the first, Phase I, testing hurdle - it could become the longest-acting form of HIV prevention available.  Currently, people can take daily pills or sometimes have injections every eight weeks, external, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), to reduce their risk.  PrEP tablets are highly effective but taking them every day can be difficult. About 39.9 million people are living with HIV, 65% of them in the World Health Organization African Region, according to the most recent figures, for 2023. And the WHO, Global Fund and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids (UNAids) are all working on strategies to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, which include improving access to medicines such as PrEP.  For the trial, 40 people without HIV were injected into the muscle with lenacapavir, with no major side effects or safety concerns. And after 56 weeks, the medicine was still detectable in their bodies. Future trials must include more diverse participants, the researchers told the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, external. But they added: \"Yearly dosing of lenacapavir has the potential to further decrease current barriers to PrEP by increasing the uptake of, persistence on, and, therefore, scalability of PrEP.\" Richard Angell, from the Terrence Higgins Trust HIV charity, said: \"PrEP as a daily pill has been a game-changer in our HIV response. \"The prospect of 'safe' annual injectable PrEP is as exciting as it is transformational. \"It's great to see these early results that suggest injectable PrEP might be effective for up to 12 months. \"We need to get ready for its rollout now and fund sexual-health clinics to do so.\" Access to PrEP had been variable, Mr Angell said, creating inequalities.  \"The oral pill is still not available in prisons, online or in community pharmacy,\" he said. \"The Scottish Medicines Consortium has finally approved two-monthly PrEP injections for use in Scotland - but we are waiting for NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approval for use in England.\" Scientists say they can cut HIV out of cells Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Georgescu barred from Romanian vote in final court ruling",
        "content": "A supporter holds a portrait of Calin Georgescu Romanian far-right populist Calin Georgescu has lost his appeal against a ruling barring him from participating in May's presidential election.  The Constitutional Court issued the final ruling on Tuesday afternoon after deliberating for two hours. It said the decision was unanimous. The Central Electoral Bureau had earlier rejected Georgescu's candidacy for a rerun of the presidential election in May.  Georgescu had won the first round of last year's presidential vote, but it was annulled after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in setting up almost 800 TikTok accounts backing him. On Sunday, the election bureau said Georgescu's candidacy did not \"meet the conditions of legality\", as he \"violated the very obligation to defend democracy\".  Georgescu appealed that verdict the following day. In a Facebook video on Tuesday night, Georgescu did not call for further protests - but instead suggested supporters could choose another candidate to back in the re-run election in May. \"If you want to support anyone by signing new lists for the presidential campaign, please do as your conscience tells you,\" he said. \"It seems democracy and freedom are taking their last breath these days. \"But we need to show now, more than any other time, that our choice matters in a peaceful and democratic way,\" Georgescu added. Earlier in the evening, many of the protesters outside the court had Romanian flags draped around their shoulders. Some held up Orthodox Christian icons and one clutched a large wooden crucifix.  A man dressed in a traditional peasant smock scaled a lamppost with a giant Romanian flag and waved it enthusiastically over the crowd. They chanted \"Calin Georgescu is president\" and \"freedom\", and condemned the judges as traitors. One woman had a sign that read \"Stop dictatorship\". It took a while for news of the ruling upholding the ban to reach the crowd. When it did, there were loud \"boos\" directed at the judges inside. Some in the crowd carried religious icons The crowd soon became noisy and angry, saying they had come to the streets to defend democracy. Calin Georgescu, the man they support, has come from the far-right fringes of Romanian politics, but he is now at the forefront and promises to make Romania great again. On 26 February, he was detained for questioning on his way to register as a candidate for the May election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to take to the streets of Bucharest in protest. Many Romanians believe he is being blocked by a political elite that is corrupt and remote from the people. George Simion, an ally of Georgescu and the leader of the far-right opposition Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) wrote on Facebook: \"Shame! You will not defeat us. The people of Romania have awoken. They will win.\" The presidential election was annulled after Georgescu won the first round in November 2024, when intelligence was released suggesting a giant TikTok promotion campaign for Georgescu had been backed by Russia. To European leaders and many in Romania it looked like Russia was trying to weaken Europe and undermine its liberal values.  That is still the opinion of many Romanians who fear a man who admires Vladimir Putin and dislikes Nato. The Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that suggestions that Russia had links to Georgescu were \"absolutely baseless\", and protesters out in Bucharest on Tuesday evening called the claims \"fake news\". \"I don't care who you vote for, I just want to be able to vote,\" Anna told the BBC.  Soon after Georgescu's video statement, people began to leave the area. Several supporters told the BBC they were disappointed more people had not come out in protest.

        "title": "Donald Trump doubles planned tariff on Canada steel and aluminium",
        "content": "Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them. Tariffs of 25% still went ahead and took effect on Wednesday. The move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country.  It marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours.  \"Cooler heads prevailed,\" Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats. Canada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office.  Trump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drugs and migrants crossing into the US.  Canada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries.  Canada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; Â£16bn) of US products.  Ford had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed.  He had also previously said he would \"not hesitate to shut off electricity completely\" if the US \"escalates\". Announcing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the \"right decision\" to try to focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal. \"With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,\" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for contacting him about a meeting. \"They understand how serious we are,\" he added. \"We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.\" In his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves.  He also criticised Canada for relying on the US for \"military protection\", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state. He added that it \"would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear\" if Canada were to join the US as a state. The White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had \"once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people\". Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government.  Faisal Islam: Trump is no longer swayed by the stock markets The back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets. The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December. The UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern. Monday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a \"transition\" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession. Investors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis. Even before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses. On Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers.  They have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming. Mr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation. \"It's definitely a worrying time for us,\" he said. \"Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Somali al-Shabab militants storm Qahira Hotel in Beledweyne",
        "content": "Al-Shabab controls large parts of rural Somalia Somali security forces have ended a deadly 24-hour siege by Islamist fighters who stormed a popular hotel in the central city of Beledweyne, authorities said.   The attack by al-Shabab began with a car bomb exploding, followed by gunmen entering the hotel, leading to intense clashes with security forces. \"The attackers have been neutralised. Some detonated themselves while others were killed by police forces,\" Omar Osman Calasow, the mayor of Beledweyne district, told the BBC. The mayor said seven people had been killed in the attack but witnesses said the death toll could be higher.  The raid at the Qahira Hotel took place as politicians, security officials and traditional elders were meeting to discuss plans for an offensive against al-Shabab in central Somalia. Police officer Ali Mahad told AFP news agency that most of those in attendance had been rescued.  A federal lawmaker from Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jesow, told the BBC that about seven gunmen had attacked the hotel.  It is unclear how many people have been wounded, but the lawmaker said they were trying to organise planes to fly victims to Mogadishu for treatment. Parts of the hotel were reduced to rubble as government forces and gunmen exchanged fire, shopkeeper Ali Suleiman, who witnessed the attack, told the Reuters news agency.   \"We first heard a huge blast followed by gunfire, then another blast was heard,\" he said. Calasow said the 24-hour siege ended on Wednesday morning, leaving \"significant damage\".  \"Among those killed in the attack were military officers, traditional elders, and soldiers,\" Calasow added.  Al-Shabab said it had killed 20 people, including government officials and leaders of a pro-government clan militia. The federal government said it was still investigating and has not commented on the reported killing of the officials.  In a statement, Ali Abdullahi Hussein, the president of Hirshabelle state, praised the security forces for their bravery in neutralising the extremist militants.  \"Let us unite to complete the elimination of these brutal extremists,\" Hussein added.  Beledweyne is about 335km (208 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, and is a strategic location in the campaign against al-Shabab. The Somali forces, alongside African Union peacekeepers, continue to wage a campaign against the militants, which remain a big threat despite the ongoing military operations.

        "title": "Kyle Clifford jailed: John Hunt's victim impact statement in full",
        "content": "John Hunt, pictured with wife Carol, said he was \"so proud of all of my girls\" Racing commentator John Hunt reduced a packed courtroom to tears as he read through his victim impact statement, moments before the man who murdered his wife and two daughters was given a whole life prison sentence. The killer once again refused to appear and face the court, but Mr Hunt nevertheless directed his words at him, pausing only at brief moments to catch his composure and his tears. This is what he said. Warning: This article contains details that some people may find distressing My name is John Hunt and I am blessed to be Carol's husband, and Hannah, Louise and Amy's dad. Thank you for returning the guilty verdict. That you had to consider the evidence was purely down to Kyle choosing to not admit responsibility. You too are victims of his callous, cowardly, vindictive behaviours and I wish he hadn't put you through that. I so wanted to deliver these words, eye to eye with Kyle. I will continue to act as if I am doing so. When I was first invited to provide a victim impact statement, I initially misunderstood its purpose. Do I really need to detail the impact of having three quarters of my family murdered? But then I realised that this was my final opportunity to say what I want to say to you specifically Kyle, words that will also be directed to your family who will carry guilt forward for the rest of their lives; I know you valued them so poorly from all the conversations we had Kyle but I suppose even they must be damaged by what you have done. I also want to confirm to the world the truth, especially how Louise conducted herself within a textbook, mature breakup on her part, understanding the conflict of saying goodbye to someone she once loved but not allowing those memories to cloud her certain knowledge that you simply failed to be the person she needed.  You failed. I am so proud of all of my girls. Unlike you Kyle, at every step of their lives they made the correct choices to improve themselves as people; Louise enjoyed more success and fulfilment in one morning than you achieved in your entire miserable life. Louise, Hannah and Carol Hunt made \"correct choices\" every step of their lives, John Hunt told Cambridge Crown Court Do you recall Kyle, how kind we all were to you? Helping you and Louise enjoy trips away, do you remember how she loved a swanky hotel? You were always invited to meals out. A Sunday lunch at the pub or a special celebration, you were always made welcome. The only Christmas you spent together was at our house. Was it four or five days you spent with us? The food, the games, the laughter, the normality... what was it about that blissful existence you hated so much, Kyle? Could you not handle how pleasant it was, such a contrast to what you were used to.  The trips to Italy, Disneyland and many more; Louise gave your relationship so much effort which you were never able or willing to match. We all offered you kindness, especially Carol. She had picked up on your personal inadequacies right from the start. She sensed your immaturity but always knew Louise would work things out. Carol still displayed her compassion right up until the moment she answered the door to you on 9 July. Do you remember her kindness Kyle; how she urged you to get some relationship help and guidance for fear that you would never be able to sustain a lasting relationship. You calmly accepted that advice on the doorstep and then, seconds later, savagely stabbed her eight times and ended her life. John Hunt paused only a few times during his statement, which was read before Clifford was sentenced to a whole life term in prison When I challenge myself about how you were able to deceive us all, I simply say that you are a psychopath who, for the duration of your time together with Louise, was able to disguise yourself as an ordinary human being.  You reserved your best make-believe version of yourself for the times you were in our house. You managed to maintain that veneer of decency throughout the first year of your time with Louise, but you couldn't maintain it in the early part of 2024. Although Carol and I never witnessed any alarming behaviour, your visits became less frequent. You began the first of two affairs that we know about, your aversion to a day's hard work continued as you messed up yet another job at Reynolds. It wasn't only the Army that found you worthless. I often think of the list Louise wrote to herself to remind her of the reasons that you fell short. The racism. She was rightly disgusted by that. Your belittling language. The fact that your family is a mess. Like any woman should be allowed to do, she worked you out despite repeated deceit and said enough is enough. I hope women around the world will take Louise's bravery as a shining beacon for their lives. If you feel enough is enough, then it is. Crossbow killer jailed for life for triple murders Recap on the sentencing hearing as it happened  I'd like to remind you Kyle of how gracious Louise was to you in that final text to you. This is what she said on the 26 June, the morning after she had finished with you face to face. She texted you thanking you for what was a wonderful year together, explaining how much she once loved you, that she never wanted any animosity to develop between you and that she wanted you to take care of yourself. You texted back saying: \"Thank you for the clarity Louise, so we can both start our healing process. I love you so much and I will for a very long time. I will always be here for you if you ever need me, please don't hesitate. I wish you all the best and take care of yourself too.\" The difference was, we know now, that Louise meant every word whereas you simply lied. You didn't love her enough to stop you having those two affairs in the spring of last year? Or to start planning to kill her and her family just days later. And that a horrific rape on her was part of the plan. Your levels of misogyny are off the scale. Louise's favourite novel from her school days was Harper Lee's classic, To Kill a Mockingbird. She was captivated by the goodness of Atticus Finch both as a father and a lawyer. She would often quote lines from the novel to match life's challenges. One of those quotes that comes to mind, right here in this moment, is that of Miss Maudie reasserting Atticus's assertion that it's a sin to Kill a Mockingbird. She said \"Your father's right. Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird\". All their lives Carol, Hannah and Louise similarly spent their time bringing joy and colour and happiness to other people's lives. You killed three beautiful Mockingbirds, Kyle. Family say crossbow killer 'belongs in hell' Crossbow killer refuses to answer police questions The arrogant ex-soldier who turned into a triple killer So, to remind you, over a period of four hours you brutally killed Carol, waited over an hour until Louise came into the house. You incapacitated her, raped her and when you realised Hannah was coming home, you shot Louise in the back. I can't imagine a more cowardly act. You couldn't look her in the eye. You murdered Hannah minutes later. So four hours. A few weeks later I also spent four hours with them Kyle; in the funeral director's. The usual room wasn't big enough for three bodies but they removed a partition wall so we could all be together. I sat for a while with Louise to my right. She looked so peaceful and Hannah to my left. I couldn't quite reach to hold their hands at the same time. Amy and I placed a photograph of Chester in Louise's right hand. Carol was at the top of the room. She was dressed in a beautiful orange dress she had bought for a wedding we went to a month beforehand. I stroked her hair and told her how much I loved her. I thanked her for being such a wonderful partner in life and wonderful mother. They were my four hours Kyle. And what about me? The impact of what you have done will be taken to my grave but on the way there, I want you to know that I stand strong before you today. As you are consigned to a fate far greater than death, I can draw on the love and strength that I still feel from the girls in every moment of every day. I am lucky. I have the most wonderful daughter; Amy who gives me such focus and purpose. I have Gareth and Alex. I have my extended family, reaching far beyond my mum, brothers and sister, aunts and uncles and cousins. I have many friends who watch out for me on an hourly basis. Carol's friends are mine and I now have a renewed relationship with Hannah's and Louise's best friends. I will always be there for them and they will be there for me too.  A morning service and vigil was held at St James's church in Bushey after the women's deaths in July So whilst I am so badly damaged, I am determined to see what my future is, surrounded by so many amazing people. And the chance to do has been gifted to me by my incredible Hannah. I firmly believe that, had she not managed to show such amazing physical and mental strength in raising the alarm after you fatally injured her, then I would have been your fourth victim that day. Hannah handed me a second chance, one that she worked so hard to achieve for me. Do you really think after what she did for me, I will slight her memory and example by just giving up?  Even though the days are difficult and feel on many occasions, impossible, I will channel my inner Atticus Finch at all times. He said: \"I want you to see what real courage is. Instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you are licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.\" And now comes the time when your fate on this earth will be confirmed. Every single person in the world, I'm thinking of mothers and fathers in particular, especially those daughters, now expects the formality of a life sentence. Never again to make choices of your own. To breathe fresh air only occasionally. To eat when someone else tells you to eat. But just remember one thing. Whatever sentence you are about to receive, whatever misery lies ahead for you for the next 60 years. Remember that after your days on earth are done, on your dying day, there will be no release for you. The screams of Hell, Kyle, I can hear them faintly now. The red carpet will come out for you. At that point, when the person you could have been meets the person you are, you will realise your miserable fate will last for eternity. This statement was written ahead of the sentencing hearing.

        "title": "North Sea collision: Ship's captain arrested for manslaughter",
        "content": "The fire is still burning on the Solong container ship, which was in a collision with the Stena Immaculate oil tanker in the Humber Estuary The captain of a cargo ship has been arrested after it collided with an oil tanker in the North Sea. The Portuguese-flagged Solong and the US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate crashed off the East Yorkshire coast at about 10:00 GMT on Monday. Humberside Police said the 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter following searches for a missing crew member of the Solong. Crowley, the Florida-based joint owners of the stricken oil tanker, said the fire on board its vessel had \"greatly diminished with no visible flames\".  The company said it was continuing to help the UK authorities during initial salvage activities but its priorities were the wellbeing of its 23-strong crew and efforts to limit the environmental impact of the crash. It added that it was unclear how much of the jet fuel it was carrying had been released into the sea but an \"initial review shows impacts have been limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation of the fuel\". German firm Ernst Russ, which owns the Solong, confirmed to the BBC that the man arrested is the master of the ship. It said he, along with the rest of the crew, were assisting the investigation. A crew member from the cargo ship was still missing and presumed dead after a search and rescue operation ended on Monday evening, according to Transport Minister Mike Kane. Whitehall sources have told the BBC there were Russians and Filipinos among the crew of the Solong. The BBC understands all of the crew on board the Stena Immaculate are Americans who are currently in Grimsby and will be repatriated in due course. 'A massive ship came out of the blue': Sailor recounts how North Sea collision unfolded Watch: Charred cargo ship and oil tanker seen from above Police said they had begun a criminal investigation into the cause of the collision and was working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch was also undertaking a parallel preliminary assessment to establish the causes of the crash, police said. HM Coastguard confirmed 36 people had been taken safely to shore. Det Ch Supt Craig Nicholson said: \"Humberside Police have taken primacy for the investigation of any potential criminal offences which arise from the collision between the two vessels.\" He said the arrested man was in custody. \"Following inquiries undertaken by my team, we have arrested a 59-year-old man on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision. \"This follows the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong. \"Our thoughts are with the family of the missing crew member, and I have appointed family liaison officers to make contact and provide support to the family.\" This video can not be played Watch: Aerial images show extent of damage to both ships Smoke is continuing to billow from Solong. The ship's German owner, Ernst Russ, said it was supporting the missing crew member's family.  It also confirmed there were no containers on board carrying sodium cyanide, as had been initially feared. \"There are four empty containers that have previously contained the hazardous chemical and these containers will continue to be monitored,\" the firm said. Crowley said its tanker was struck by Solong while anchored off the coast of Hull, causing \"multiple explosions\" on board and an unknown quantity of jet fuel to be released. The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks, at least one of which was ruptured when it was struck. Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, said officials had told him there was no evidence so far of any of the heavy engine oil leaking from either ship, or pollution in the water or the air. Tug boats shadow the Solong container ship as it drifts in the Humber Estuary while alight On Tuesday, Kane told the House of Commons the \"working assumption\" was that one crew member from the cargo ship had died. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she had met with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and been informed that early indications suggest both vessels are now expected to stay afloat. She added the Solong could be \"towed away from the shore, and salvage operations can get under way\". Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the US government's tanker security programme, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed, according to Crowley. It had been anchored while waiting for a berth to become available at the Port of Killingholme on the River Humber, the company said. Additional reporting by Stuart Harratt and Kevin Shoesmith.

        "title": "Canada tariffs updates: White House halts plan to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium",
        "content": "White House officials say the US will impose 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, rather than the 50% Donald Trump announced earlier The rollback comes after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would temporarily suspend its plan to charge a 25% tariff on electricity it sends to northern US states That reversal came after US President Trump had said he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50% in retaliation to the Ontario threat  According to the province's Premier Doug Ford, negotiations between his province and the Trump administration are ongoing, with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick inviting Ford to Washington As a reminder: Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The companies that bring the goods into the country pay the tax to the government Trump said the tariffs will begin on Wednesday, adding that he'll declare \"a national emergency on electricity\" in those states Meanwhile, Trump is meeting a group of business CEOs in Washington DC Tuesday's tariff back-and-forth comes after the worst day of 2025 for US markets, fuelled by fears of President Trump's aggressive tariffs on America's biggest trading partners This video can not be played Doug Ford suspends electricity surcharge until meeting with US Edited by Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies Alex LedermanUS reporter It seems the day will end as it began on the tariffs front - with the US planning to impose a 25% surcharge on steel and aluminium imported from Canada, as well from everywhere else in the world, starting at midnight.  But in the intervening hours, economic threats and then rollbacks have flown back and forth across the US-Canadian border all day. Just a few days ago, I was in the room as Canadaâs Liberal Party gathered to elect its next leader on Sunday. With the US president's warnings from across the border, the anti-Trump feeling in the room was palpable. The red maple leaf Canadian flag hung everywhere in sight.  Canadians - usually stereotyped for being so polite - were ready for a fight.   A once-dejected Liberal Party felt rejuvenated. With a trade war looming and a widespread feeling that Canadian sovereignty could be under threat, the party had a newfound sense of purpose.  \"In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" the newly selected party leader Mark Carney told a roaring crowd.\n\nPolls showed a huge bounce back from near-certain defeat to the Conservatives in the coming general election.   Just hours before, hundreds of ordinary Canadians made their voices heard outside Parliament.\n\nâWe are not for sale!\" one sign read. \"Not a 51st anything,\" another poster said, held high. \"If there's anybody out there threatening my home, I want to be a part of the fight against that,\" one woman told us.  The entire political landscape has changed in Canada. With Donald Trump's tariffs and threats, Canadians have rallied around their flag.  It's been a hectic Tuesday for North American trade, with threats of fees on imported goods flying back and forth between the US and Canada like a ping pong ball.   Yesterday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity sent from the province to the US, threatening to \"shut off electricity completely\" if the US were to further escalate the ongoing trade war. Trump retaliated by doubling the US's upcoming 25% global steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% for Canada.  But then by this afternoon, both parties had stepped back from these vows. Head spun? Here's an approximate timeline of how it all went down, in Eastern Daylight Time:  10:30 am Trump announces an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium in retaliation to Doug Ford's Monday electricity surcharge threat, bringing the import fee to 50% 12:25 pm When asked why Mexico wasn't facing the same fees, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded: \"We're respectful\"  12:40 pm Ford says he will meet with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that shutting off electricity to various northern US states is the âlast thingâ he wants to do  13:45 pm White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Ontario's threat to shut down electricity imports to the US \"egregious and insulting\". When asked if the US still considers Canada a close ally, she says they \"might be a competitor now\" 13:55 pm Canada's next Prime Minister Mark Carney posts on social media, calling the new tariff hike \"an attackâ, saying his government will \"ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada\"  14.05 pm The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that without its country's exports, \"the US won't have enough of either metal to satisfy the needs of its demanding economy\", suggesting Trump's promised \"golden era\" would therefore not be possible  14:50 pm Ford says he will suspend the electricity surcharge after Lutnick reached out to him in a phone call with an \"olive branch\", adding that he will be headed to Washington on Thursday to negotiate with the US trade secretary and is \"pretty confident\" Trump will back down on the additional tariff hikes  15:35 pm Trump says he's \"looking at\" walking back the additional hikes and \"could make a different decision\"  16:50 pm White House officials Lutnick and Peter Navarro confirm Trump has reversed his plans to double the steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada to 50%, and say the 25% tariff will go into effect as scheduled at midnight for Ottawa and the rest of the world Much of today's tariff discussion was centred around Canadian energy imports to the United States. President Donald Trump blamed the province of Ontario's now-rescinded move to place a 25% surcharge on electricity heading into the US as the reason for his now-cancelled decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs. But how much electricity does the US import from Canada ? When Ontarioâs leader Doug Ford announced the 25% surcharge on electricity exports, he suggested that the measure would impact 1.5 million homes and businesses across the northern states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York.  Canadian Minister Stephen Lecce has also claimed that Canada sells 12,000 megawatts of power into the US market each day, and is a â30 times net exporterâ to the US - âthey need our powerâ, he says. According to Electricity Canada, external, a trade association for Canadian energy suppliers, the US imports electricity from its neighbour because it makes sense for affordability. The trade association says that cross-border trade in electricity works by allowing regions to coordinate with neighbours to draw on each otherâs surplus supplies when excess electricity isnât being used, therefore keeping costs down and avoiding overbuilding.  For instance, it says, Canadians tend to use more electricity during winter for heating, while demand in the US is higher during the summer, when it is needed for cooling. The White House says Donald Trump has delivered \"a win for the American people\", after Ontario Premier Doug Ford dropped his threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the US. In response, Trump had also threatened to double the rate of aluminium and steel tariffs on Canada from 25% to 50%. He has also since walked back on this threat. \"President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world,\" the statement says. The White House says Trump's plans for a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will still take effect on Wednesday - \"with no exceptions or exemptions\".  Jessica MurphyReporting from Toronto Marty Warren, the national director for the union representing steelworkers in Canada, tells the BBC the on-again-off-again threats of tariffs from the US on his industry are \"reckless\" and have been a cause of major anxiety for workers. \"Our members are scared,\" Warren of the United Steelworkers tells the BBC. Earlier on Tuesday, the union said the tariffs would be an \"industry killer\" that would lead to job losses. Warren says that his union has been in discussions with its US counterpart to send a message that these tariffs stand to hurt both American and Canadian workers. \"We're relying on allies. Some won't speak up,\" he acknowledges. \"Some will, but we're trying to work closely and lobby the people that we think we can get a message through.\" He adds his union members are not only concerned about tariffs, but also the sovereignty of Canada as US President Donald Trump repeats his desire to make Canada \"the 51st state.\" Warren notes that this second Trump administration is different from his first, which also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium back in 2018. They were rolled back the following year. \"Trump said he would take Canada through economic means,\" he says. \"This constant threat, this constant disrespect for Canadians and Canada's sovereignty is what makes it different.\" Charging some of its closest allies and trade partners more to import goods might seem counterintuitive for the US.   But by making imports more expensive, Trump is hoping to stoke demand for US-made goods, helping to boost domestic manufacturing.   Trump has also said he wants to raise money for the government through the fees.  Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News the presidentâs âgoal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the out outsiders payâ - a proposal the president has dubbed the âExternal Revenue Serviceâ.  If trade dries up though, it's not clear how much revenue tariffs will raise.  Before the media left the room, Trump made some wide-ranging opening remarks at the business roundtable event, covering everything from ceasefire negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine to the success of Doge. He spoke briefly about tariffs, saying they're having a \"tremendously positive impact\". He claimed car companies have relocated their manufacturing from Mexico to the US. He also accused China of owning the plants being built in Mexico, adding that tariffs had put a stop to that now.  The relocation of industry to the US is a \"bigger win\" than the money being brought in by the tariffs, he said. After President Trump entered the roundtable event and made his opening remarks, the media present appear to have been asked to leave shortly after he began answering questions. Our feed has been cut. Online feeds run by other outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Fox, have also been turned off. President Trump is now meeting the CEOs of America's largest companies for a roundtable discussion, where the current economic situation is sure to be top of the agenda. Around 100 business leaders are expected to be in attendance at the regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, DC. Those in the room will include the CEOs of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart. The meeting comes as US stock markets plummeted in response to Trump's threats of tariffs on neighbouring Canada and Mexico, as well as other nations. The market drop signals anxiety on the part of investors, who worry that the tariffs could trigger an economic slowdown or cause a recession.  Trump himself declined to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News last week, saying: \"I hate to predict things like that\" after acknowledging that his policies will bring about a period of transition.  In addition to senior US trade adviser Peter Navarro, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has now also confirmed that the White House will no longer impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, according to the BBC's US media partner, CBS news.  Trump had earlier suggested a reversion to 25% tariffs could happen today.  The original 25% tariffs will still go into effect on Wednesday, Lutnick says.  Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House Senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has confirmed that the administration has reversed plans to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Navarro says the change happened after Ontario's Premier Doug Ford backed down from his electricity surcharge, which Navarro described as \"sounding ominous\". \"I think he [Doug Ford] kind of understood that this was not going to be a fight,\" Navarro says. \"I've encouraged our friends in Canada to keep the rhetoric down.\"  The 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel will still be enforced.  Earlier, Navarro said Ford was a \"politician in Canada\" rather than an economist.  Additionally, while Navarro said the transition to \"Trumponomics\" could be a \"little bumpy\", he said the administration was confident.  \"If you're a stock market investor and you understand Trumponomics, you will be bullish, and you won't fall prey to daily volatility and get fleeced by day traders,\" Navarro added.  While President Donald Trump has hinted he might consider cutting back on the 50% tariffs he's announced on Canadian steel and aluminium, plans are currently still in place to bring in 25% tariffs on these materials from midnight on Wednesday for several countries. US steel and aluminium imports from a number of countries, including Canada, its biggest steel supplier, will be taxed at a minimum of 25%. The other countries listed in his executive order, external signed in February include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, EU countries, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the UK.  The order revokes exemptions for tariffs Trump had made for those countries during his first term, in 2018. It also increases aluminium tariffs from 10% to 25%. Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House It's rare to see a White House news conference in any administration where a US ally is spoken about in the tone used today with regard to Canada, even in periods when officials in Washington have clearly been exasperated with their partners abroad. At one point, Leavitt recited statistics on the cost of living in major Canadian cities, saying their residents would be âbetter servedâ if, as Trump has suggested, Canada becomes the 51st state of the US. The White House posture towards Canada is starkly different to the stance on Mexico, which has also faced the threat of tariffs.  Just recently, for example, Trump said he had a âgreat relationshipâ with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom the Washington Post this week dubbed âthe worldâs greatest Trump whispererâ. Nadine YousifReporting from Toronto We just heard from Ontario's leader Doug Ford, who announced at the top of his news conference that he has agreed to temporarily pause a 25% surcharge to electricity his province sends to 1.5 million American homes, after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick extended an \"olive branch\". Earlier today, President Trump threatened to double tariffs he planned to impose tomorrow on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Ontario's electricity hike. This afternoon, after Ford spoke, Trump said he could cut back on import duties. All eyes will now be on a meeting that is set to take place between Ford and Lutnick. That will happen on Thursday in Washington, according to Lutnick. Among those in attendance will be Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc. Ford cautioned that Ontario still has electricity as a bargaining chip. But he said that he would not deny an opportunity to sit down with the Americans and let \"cooler heads prevail\". This video can not be played Trump to 'probably' cut Canada tariffs after Doug Ford's reversal We've just heard a response from Donald Trump following Doug Ford's reversal on imposing a 25% tariff on electricity flowing from his province to northern US states.  The president tells reporters at the White House that he's now considering cutting back on the 50% tariffs he announced earlier on Tuesday. Trump said he's \"looking at it\" and could \"make a different decision\". Trump then confirmed that the \"strong man in Canada\" - referring to Ford, who also earlier threatened to cut off electricity exports to the US - has suspended his own tariff plans. \"I respect that,\" Trump said.  US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \"Iâm glad they listened\" in a post on social media, after Canada's Doug Ford announced a pause on plans to end his territory's energy exports to some US states.  Tensions quickly flared between Ford and Trump on Tuesday, after Ford said he would \"not hesitate\" to stop supplying the US with electricity in response to Trump's tariffs, and Trump in turn said Canada would pay a price \"so big it will be read about in history books for years to come\". Lutnick announced that he and Ford have agreed to meet in Washington on Thursday ahead of Trump's 2 April deadline for reciprocal tariffs. In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota, Lutnick said.  Ontario Premier Doug Ford has just finished speaking to the press in Toronto after a back and forth over tariffs between the US and Canada.   Hereâs what you need to know:   One other notable soundbite from that news conference with Ontario Premier Ford. He told reporters: \"You can't attack your number one customer, Canada, and not expect a response.\" He said the country had responded to US tariffs and the next step was to negotiate.   Calling himself a âbusinesspersonâ, he said he wanted to find a solution to âstop the bleedingâ.  Ford added that China was sitting back and laughing at the US and Canada's trade spat.  Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent As President Trump escalated his trade war with\nCanada and US stocks rode a rollercoaster, White House press\nsecretary Karoline Leavitt painted an upbeat picture earlier today. Setbacks are only âtemporaryâ.  Economic warning\nsigns are just a âsnapshot in timeâ.  Manufacturing job numbers are strong, and\nforeign investments are up.  And to whatever extent there are problems with the\nUS economy, it is because of Trumpâs predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. American voters tend to have short memories,\nhowever, and blaming current conditions on a president who left office in\nJanuary is unlikely to fly for long â particularly when economic uncertainty\nhas been exacerbated by Trumpâs own actions. That short memory ultimately may end up helping\nTrump and his team, however, if their trade and government-slashing plans do\neventually lead to the kind of growth they have promised.  Congressional\nelections arenât until November 2026, and this is still early in Trumpâs second\nterm. There is plenty of time to bounce back. But\nevery day on this current trajectory means the political hole the president is\ndigging gets deeper, whether Leavitt acknowledges that from the White House\npodium or not. Ford says that when someone extends an \"olive branch\", he would thank them for the opporutnity. \"All you folks have seen how President Trump has changed things on a daily basis,\" Ford said. \"I don't want to wait until April 2,\" when Trump said reciprocal tariffs would kick in, Ford said. \"God only knows\" what would happen between now and that deadline, he said.

        "title": "Donald Trump vows to 'buy a brand new Tesla' after stock slump",
        "content": "People protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company. Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it. Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration. Trump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\". This video can not be played Watch: 'Thank God for Elon Musk' - Maga Republicans praise Doge cuts The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons. He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year. The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday. Trump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\" Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).  He has instigated sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics. That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners. \"Tesla takedown\" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.  Organisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week. Musk's Tesla facilities in US face 'Takedown' protests Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries? Who is Elon Musk? Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled \"domestic terrorists\", the president said \"I will do that\", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson. \"You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,\" Trump said. On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on \"radical left lunatics\", who he said were trying to \"illegally and collusively boycott\" the firm. However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year. UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year. Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall. Ultimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said. \"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said. Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). There has also been a steep decline in China â a key market â and Australia. Some experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies. Investors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said. There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms. In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\". Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday. Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations. Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January that Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability. Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump's tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.

        "content": "More than 12 million customers of Nationwide will each receive a payment of Â£50 following the takeover of Virgin Money. The Nationwide, the UK's largest building society, described the money as a \"thank you\" to its members, at a cost of Â£600m. However, there was criticism that the same members were not given a vote on the Â£2.8bn acquisition of Virgin Money last year. Most customers will receive the Â£50 directly into their accounts by the end of April, although some will be paid by cheque. Nationwide is writing to members receiving the payment from now to let them know how and when they will get the money. The payments will go to more 12 million customers who: Had a savings or current account, or mortgage, at the end of last September Additionally, have made at least one transaction on their current account or savings, or had a balance of at least Â£100 in their current account, savings or mortgage in the 12 months to the end of September last year Still have their accounts or mortgage at the time the payment is made Those criteria mean about four million customers will not receive the payment. The customers of Virgin Money - which was the name for the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank group - will not be eligible for the money either. Debbie Crosbie, Nationwide chief executive, said the payment \"recognises the role our members played in building the financial strength that made the deal possible\". Following last year's deal - the biggest banking takeover since the financial crisis - Nationwide became the UK's second largest provider of mortgages and savings accounts. However, there was some controversy over the fact that, while Virgin Money members were given a vote on the deal, Nationwide members were not. Nationwide's board decided no member approval was required. The Â£50 payment  is separate to Nationwide's so-called fairer share payments scheme, which periodically returns some of its profits to members.

        "content": "Paul Danan found fame on Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks and reality TV shows Hollyoaks actor and reality TV star Paul Danan died at his Bristol home from a cocktail of drugs including cocaine and heroin, an inquest opening has been told.  Danan died in January at the age of 46. The inquest was opened and adjourned on Tuesday at Avon Coroner's Court, with senior coroner Maria Voisin setting a provisional date of 28 May for the actor's full inquest hearing. Danan, who played Sol Patrick in Hollyoaks, was also known for his appearances on the likes of  Celebrity Love Island and Celebrity Big Brother. Coroner's officer Alexis Camp told the hearing that Danan was pronounced dead at his home in Brislington, Bristol, at 5.20pm on 15 January. His body was identified at the scene by his partner, Melissa Crooks. Ms Camp said: \"The circumstances are that Mr Danan was found unresponsive at his home address. \"Emergency services attended and confirmed he had sadly died. A post-mortem has taken place and samples have been removed for further analysis.\" The court was told that the provisional cause of Danan's death is combined toxicity of heroin, methadone, codeine, pregabalin, cocaine, zopiclone, contributed to by benzodiazepine use. Ms Camp said: \"I understand there are no family concerns,\" adding that \"no note was left\" by the star. Statements will be taken from Danan's GP, family, police, the ambulance service and inquiries are ongoing with Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (AWP), she said.  Danan had been due to appear for a plea hearing at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 16 January after being charged with being in possession of cocaine and cannabis, according to court documents. He was also accused of driving whilst under the influence of drugs on 2 October last year, in Warrington, Cheshire. Danan had openly discussed previous issues with drugs, including addictions to cocaine and codeine, which he said he used to \"self-soothe\" after losing acting parts in his 20s while in the US. He also said that he had spent more than Â£1m on rehab over the years. In 2020, Danan launched drama classes in Bristol, his adopted home, for adults with mental health or addiction issues, or who have been through trauma or been in prison. Speaking at the time of his death, the actor's management company said he was \"known for his television presence, exceptional talent and unwavering kindness\", and had been \"a beacon of light to so many\".

        "content": "Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba described South Sudan's President Salva Kiir as a brother to his own head of state South Sudan's government has denied earlier reports that Uganda had deployed special forces to its capital, Juba. Uganda's military chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba said the soldiers had gone to the neighbouring country to help South Sudanese President Salva Kiir \"secure\" the city. The statement came amid escalating tensions between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, raising fears that their fragile peace deal could collapse and a conflict could resume.  \"We shall protect the entire territory of South Sudan like it was our own,\" Gen Kainerugaba had written on the social media platform X, external.  Uganda's army spokesperson Felix Kulayigye also confirmed the deployment to the BBC but declined to reveal details. South Sudan's government did not immediately respond to the reports on Tuesday morning, but speaking to local media later Information Minister Michael Makuei said Ugandan troops were not in Juba. Concern about the security situation in South Sudan has been mounting, with the US on Saturday ordering the evacuation of all its non-emergency staff from the country.  Last week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers - all allies of Machar - were arrested by the security forces, which an opposition spokesman called a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal. One of the ministers has since been released. The arrests followed clashes in the Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army. It had fought alongside Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 following  a power struggle between him and Kiir. It led to heavy fighting in Juba, with Kiir accusing Machar of plotting a coup. Machar denied the allegation, but South Sudan then plunged into a civil war that killed more than 400,000 people. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.

        "content": "Desmond and Mary Byrne were counter sued after being attacked by neighbours A couple who retired to Thailand said they have been told to prepare to be sent to prison after they were attacked by neighbours. Mary Byrne, 69, and her husband Desmond, 77, who emigrated from Middlesbrough in 2021, said they became embroiled in a dispute with a younger couple over access and a small garden. In December 2023 the Byrnes were alerted to a commotion in their garden but found themselves being kicked and punched in an incident which was caught on CCTV. Their neighbours were prosecuted, but now Mr and Mrs Byrne have been charged themselves and said they have been told by the British Embassy the outcome could go \"either way\". Mrs Byrne said their neighbours were Thai kickboxers and that the woman \"continually stamped on my head\" while her husband was \"ferociously thumped 22 times\". \"At one stage Des did kick his leg up in defence and as far as we know he did not have contact,\" she said. \"I strongly believe, 100%, it was in defence.\" After initially denying charges, the younger couple are understood to have pleaded guilty. But in May last year Mr and Mrs Byrne were called to a police station and told they were being charged with injuring their neighbours. Mrs Byrne said her head was stamped on while her husband was \"thumped 22 times\". The Byrnes said they had their fingerprints taken and passports confiscated.  \"We were extremely shocked,\" Mrs Byrne said. \"The superficial injuries to both of these people is laughable.\" The couple are due back in court on Wednesday to learn the outcome, but said they \"feel trapped\" waiting. \"We can't get out, we can't leave. So in one way or another, we feel trapped,\" Mrs Byrne said. Luke Myer, the couple's former MP, told BBC Radio Tees: \"I'm doing everything I can to raise Mary and Desmond's case with the Foreign Office. \"Of course, it is a matter for the Thai legal system and we can't interfere with that. \"I think raising the profile of the issue is really important to make sure they are treated fairly and ultimately they are able to come home.\" A Foreign Office spokesperson said they are supporting two British nationals in Thailand and are in touch with the local authorities. \"We are not pessimistic, we both know we've done nothing wrong,\" said Mrs Byrne. \"But we have to prepare for whatever they're going to do for us.\" Follow BBC Tees on X,, external Facebook, external, Nextdoor and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Air India plane diverted after plastic bags and clothes block toilets",
        "content": "The airline said it found polythene bags, rags and clothes inside the lavatories  Air India has confirmed that one of its flights from the US was forced to turn around last week after passengers trying to flush away plastic bags, rags and clothes clogged up most of its toilets. The plane, which was heading from Chicago to India's capital Delhi, spent several hours in the air before it returned to the US city.  Video clips from inside the aircraft showed scenes of confusion as passengers huddled around crew members who seemed to be explaining the situation.  The incident has stirred a lively debate on social media, with many Indians weighing in on aeroplane bathroom etiquette.  The incident took place on 5 March on Air India Flight 126, according to a statement by the airline released on Monday. About two hours into the flight, crew members reported that some of the toilets were \"unserviceable\".  Subsequently, they found eight of the 12 toilets in business and economy class could not be used, \"causing discomfort to all on board\". The plane can carry up to 342 passengers. At that point the plane was already flying over the Atlantic Ocean, according to Air India's statement. Due to restrictions on night operations at most European airports at the time, the pilots decided to return to Chicago for \"passenger comfort and safety\". A BBC check on flight tracking website Flightradar24 found the plane was near Greenland when it turned around, and had spent a total of 10 hours in the air. Air India said an investigation later found \"polythene bags, rags and clothes that had been flushed down and stuck in the plumbing\" of the plane's toilets. It released several pictures showing bags containing waste cleared from the toilets. One photo showed a crew member holding a drainage pipe completely stuffed with what appeared to be rags. The statement said that all passengers and crew disembarked normally in Chicago and were provided with accommodation and alternative flight options. Plane toilets store human waste in special tanks and use a vacuum system for flushing. These are normally disposed of once the plane has landed.  While clogged toilets are not uncommon, it is \"next to impossible\" for all toilets to break down \"due to only passengers' fault, and in a way that it causes an emergency diversion\", Mark Martin, an aviation expert, told the Hindustan Times newspaper. But Air India said it had previously found objects such as blankets, underwear and diapers flushed down its planes' toilets. \"We take this opportunity to urge passengers to use lavatories only for the purposes that they are meant for,\" it said.  On X, many criticised the airline for poor upkeep and the lack of sanitation facilities on its aeroplanes.  \"Only Air India has such frequent mishaps. Honestly what has happened is indefensible,\" one user said. But others pointed out that the airline could not be held responsible for the situation.  \"Can we honestly dump all the blame on Air India and the crew, when people can't follow basic travel etiquette?\" another user said.

        "title": "Doctors didn't warn women of 'risky sex' drug urges",
        "content": "One woman, Lucy, says she lost \"a decade of her to life\" to compulsive gambling and risky sex after being prescribed a partial dopamine agonist Patients prescribed drugs for movement disorders - including restless leg syndrome (RLS) - say doctors did not warn them about serious side effects that led them to seek out risky sexual behaviour. Twenty women have told the BBC that the drugs - given to them for RLS, which causes an irresistible urge to move - ruined their lives. A report by drugs firm GSK - seen by the BBC - shows it learned in 2003 of a link between the medicines, known as dopamine agonist drugs, and what it described as \"deviant\" sexual behaviour. It cited a case of a man who had sexually assaulted a child while taking the drug for Parkinson's. While there is no explicit reference to this side effect in patient leaflets, the UK medicines regulator told us there was a general warning, external about increased libido and harmful behaviour. GSK says a risk of \"altered\" sexual interest is also referred to in the leaflets. Some of the women who described being drawn to risky sexual behaviour told us they had no idea of what was causing it. Others said they felt compelled to gamble or shop with no history of such activities. One accumulated debts of more than Â£150,000. Like many women, Claire first developed RLS during her pregnancies. The relentless need to move was often accompanied by sleeplessness and a crawling sensation under her skin. The condition persisted after giving birth and she was prescribed the dopamine agonist drug Ropinirole. She says she was not warned by doctors of any side effects. It initially worked wonders for her RLS, she says, but after a year or so she began feeling unprecedented sexual urges. \"The only way I could describe it is it was just deviant,\" she tells us - using that word without any knowledge of the GSK research which had established a link with such behaviour. The 2003 GSK report noted that a man on Ropinirole had sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence Claire says she began leaving her house in the early hours of the morning to cruise for sex. Wearing a see-through top and jacket, she would flash her chest at any man she could find. She did this regularly, she says, and in increasingly dangerous locations, despite having a partner. \"There remains an element in your head that knows what you're doing is wrong, but it affects you to the point that you don't know you're doing it.\" Claire says it took years to connect these urges with her medication - and they disappeared almost immediately when she stopped taking it. She feels complete \"shame\" and is \"mortified\" at the danger she placed herself in. Listen to 5 Minutes On: The prescription drugs that gave me a gambling addiction Impulsive behaviours, including gambling and increased sex drive, have long been listed as side effects in medicine leaflets for dopamine agonist drugs - and are thought to affect between 6% to 17% of RLS patients taking them, according to health guidance body NICE, external. A \"common\" side effect of any medicine can be considered to only affect as few as 1% of people who take it, according to the NHS. The drugs work by mimicking the behaviour of dopamine, a natural chemical in our brains which helps regulate movement. It is known as the \"happy hormone\" because it is activated when something is pleasurable or we feel rewarded. But agonist drugs can over-stimulate these feelings and under-stimulate the appreciation of consequences - leading to impulsive behaviour, according to academics. Sue told us she accumulated gambling debts of Â£80,000 The cases of what the GSK report from 2003 described as \"deviant behaviour\"  involved two men who were prescribed Ropinirole for Parkinson's disease. In one, a 63-year-old-man sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl, leading to a custodial sentence. The documents said the perpetrator's libido had increased significantly from the start of his treatment with Ropinirole and his \"libido problem subsequently resolved\" after his dose was reduced. In the second case, a 45-year-old man carried out \"uncontrolled acts of exhibitionism and indecent behaviour\". His sex drive was reported to have increased prior to being prescribed Ropinirole but his urges \"intensified\" after the treatment. Prevalence rates of what GSK calls \"deviant\" sexual behaviours caused by the drugs are unknown and tend to be under-reported by those who experience them, according to Valerie Voon, a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of Cambridge. \"There's a lot of stigma and shame attached to it, and people don't realise that it's associated with a medication,\" she says. Prof Voon believes risky sexual behaviours - beyond a purely increased libido - should be specifically warned about and screened by the NHS, because their impact can be \"devastating\". RLS is believed to affect about one in 20 adults - and women are about twice as likely to suffer as men. The 20 sufferers we spoke to say not only had doctors failed to tell them of the potentially serious side effects of the drugs, but also failed to review the impact of the medication on their bodies subsequently. Sarah was in her 50s when she was prescribed another dopamine agonist drug made by a different manufacturer. \"Previously I'd have had no interest if Brad Pitt walked in the room naked,\" she says. \"But it turned me into this raging woman who kept taking sexual addiction further.\" Sarah began selling used underwear and videos of sex acts online - and organising telephone sex with strangers. She also began shopping compulsively - ending up with Â£30,000 of debt. To combat the effects of the dopamine agonist, she began self-medicating by taking pain-relieving opioids and sleeping pills. She ended up being admitted to rehab - but that meant her driving licence was taken away and she lost her job. \"I turned to things that weren't healthy - I knew that the behaviour wasn't me, but I couldn't control it,\" she tells the BBC.

She even mentioned recent gambling behaviour when the second drug was prescribed, she says. She went on to rack up debts of Â£80,000. \"The effect on my family was horrific - it was life-changing money to lose,\" she says. \"But at the time I didn't know it was no fault of my own.\" A class action was brought against GSK in 2011 by four sufferers of Parkinson's disease - the BBC has learned. They said Ropinirole led to gambling debts and broken relationships. They also complained that despite a link between such behaviours and the drug having been established in medical studies as early as 2000, GSK had failed to include any warnings in its product literature until March 2007. The class action was settled but GSK denied liability. Cases of serious side effects have also been reported in other countries, particularly in relation to the use of drugs for Parkinson's disease. In France, a court awarded damages to a father of two who complained that Ropinirole had given him compulsive homosexual urges, while another man without a criminal record began torturing cats. In the US, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends the drugs should only be used for short-term treatment, such as end-of-life care. Many of the women the BBC spoke to also complained that prolonged use of the drugs also worsened their underlying RLS. It meant their dosage had been increased which, in turn, had exacerbated their compulsive behaviour - a process known as augmentation. Dr Guy Leschziner, a consultant neurologist, says the drugs still play an important role but he believes that drug companies, health authorities and doctors need to better warn patients of these side effects. \"Not everybody knows the kinds of really quite dramatic changes that can occur,\" he says. A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line. In a statement, GSK told the BBC Ropinirole had been prescribed for more than 17 million treatments and undergone \"extensive clinical trials\". It added the drug had proven to be effective and had a \"well-characterised safety profile\". \"As with all medicines, [it] has potential side effects and these are clearly stated in the prescribing information,\" it said. In response to its 2003 research that had found a link with \"deviant\" sexual behaviour, GSK told us this was shared with health authorities and had informed updates in prescribing information - which now lists \"altered or increased sexual interest\" and \"behaviour of significant concern\" as side effects. The current patient information leaflet for Ropinirole, external makes specific reference to changes in sexual interest on five occasions - almost exclusively warning about the frequency or strength of such feelings as potentially \"abnormally high\", \"excessive\" or \"increase[d]\". The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said that while a specific reference to \"deviant\" sexual behaviour is not included in warnings, such impulses vary and a general warning about activities which may be harmful is included. It also said that it is important for healthcare professionals to explain the possible risk to patients and not all experience these types of side effects. The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment. Some names have been changed in this article to protect people's identities.

Bath & North East Somerset Council is proposing to build the new schools in the former Culverhay School and Odd Down Sports Ground sites on the southern edge of the city. The plan includes a 120-place school for pupils with special educational needs, and the other is a 55-place alternate provision school. The council said Culverhay Sports Centre will close on 28 June so works could start, after officials deemed it as being at the end of its lifespan. More news stories for Somerset Listen to the latest news for Somerset A brand new gym and fitness spaces will also be built, as well as padel tennis courts and new walking trails around the playing fields. Culverhay Sports Centre has been operational since the 1990s and is only open in the evenings and partially on the weekend. Sports clubs currently using the centre would be offered alternative booking options at other leisure centres in Bath and Kenysham. Councillor Paul May, cabinet member for Children's Services, said the new schools would \"eventually\" provide places for pupils who needed support and would not have to leave the area for education. Barnaby Rich, partnership manager for the council at GLL, which manages the leisure centres in Bath and Keynsham, said the new sports facilities at Odd Down would bring \"significantly enhanced availability throughout the week\". \"Health and fitness members at Culverhay Sports Centre will have access to all our UK centres and can continue their fitness routines at our Bath or Keynsham leisure centres at no extra cost.  \"Additionally, we plan to run some of Culverhay's ongoing classes at Odd Down Sports Ground to reduce the necessity for extra travel.\" Draft plans for Odd Down will be go to public consultation in the spring.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: At the scene of drone attack on Moscow Three men have been killed in the Moscow region, in what is described as the largest drone attack on the Russian capital since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine. A further 18 people, including three children, were injured, health officials told Russian media. Officials said all three men who died had been working at a distribution centre when it was hit by drone debris in the village of Yam, near Domodedovo airport. Dozens of vehicles were destroyed when the drone hit a car park, and the glass front of a supermarket was badly damaged. The Russian defence ministry said 337 drones were intercepted over Russia and 91 of them were shot down over the Moscow region. Vorobyev said two of the men died while starting their shift at a food distribution centre The three men who died were aged 38, 43 and 50.  One was working as a security guard while the other two had just begun their shift at the Miratorg agricultural distribution centre when it was hit by a drone at 05:14 (02:14 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Moscow's regional governor Andrei Vorobyov. The company said later that 40 cars had been damaged in the car park. Several people were also hurt when a block of flats was hit in Vidnoye, just south of the Moscow ring road, and another block was damaged in the town of Ramenskoye, further to the east. Hours earlier, four people had been killed on Monday evening when a shopping centre was hit by shelling in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, according to Russian officials. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said seven apartments were damaged in Ramenskoye and he said it was \"the most massive\" drone attack that his region had seen. The roof of one building was damaged by drone wreckage, though Sobyanin described the damage as \"insignificant\". He also said 12 people - including three children - had to be evacuated following the overnight strike. One district train network was suspended, and flight restrictions were put in place at Moscow's airports after the attack.  Follow updates on this story The attack came hours ahead of a crunch meeting between representatives from the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia, focused on ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. The talks in Jeddah between Ukrainian delegates and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were the first official meeting since last month's fiery exchange at the White House between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump. Rubio suggested on Monday that, as part of an agreement to stop the war, Ukraine may have to relinquish territory to Russia, adding that both sides needed to understand that \"there's no military solution to this situation\". Flight restrictions were imposed on Moscow's four major airports due to the attack Following the strikes, flight restrictions were imposed on Moscow's four major airports - Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo, Vnukovo and Zhukovsky - as well as airports in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions. These are major transport hubs used by millions of passengers every year. Russia's defence ministry later said that, overall, 337 Ukrainian drones were either intercepted or destroyed overnight in the Moscow and nine other Russian regions, including Kursk. Officials in Kyiv said the scale of the attack was intended as a signal to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire in the air and sea. Overnight, Ukrainian officials reported Russian drone attacks on the capital Kyiv and several other regions.  Ukraine's air force said it had shot down 79 of 126 drones launched by Russia, as well as an Iskander-M ballistic missile. It added that another 35 drones had probably failed to reach their targets due to electronic warfare countermeasures, though it was unclear whether the other 12 hit their targets. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Rubio says Ukraine partial ceasefire plan 'has promise' ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?

        "title": "Rodrigo Duterte: Philippines ex-leader arrested after ICC warrant",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Rodrigo Duterte questions ICC warrant for his arrest A plane carrying the former president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has left Manila after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity over his deadly \"war on drugs\". He was taken into police custody shortly after his arrival at the capital's international airport from Hong Kong on Tuesday morning.  Duterte, 79, contested his detention but within hours was on a chartered jet en route to The Hague in the Netherlands, where the ICC sits. Current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said the country was meeting its legal obligations. During Duterte's time in office, thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial. Marcos said his predecessor would face charges relating to what he described as Duterte's \"bloody war on drugs\".  \"Interpol asked for help and we obliged,\" President Marcos told a press conference. \"This is what the international community expects of us.\" Duterte's daughter Sara, who said she would accompany him to The Hague, is vice president and a political rival of Marcos. She has said the arrest amounts to persecution. Rodrigo Duterte has offered no apologies for his brutal anti-drugs crackdown, which saw more than 6,000 suspects killed when he was president from 2016 to 2022, and mayor of Davao city before that. Nevertheless, he questioned the basis for the warrant, asking: \"What crime [have] I committed?\" in a video posted online on Tuesday by another daughter, Veronica Duterte. \"If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts, with Filipino judges, and I will allow myself to be jailed in my own nation,\" he said in a later video.  In response to his arrest, a petition was launched on his behalf in the Supreme Court - urging it not to comply with the request. According to a statement from the court's spokesperson, the former president also called for a declaration that the Philippines withdrawal from the ICC in 2019 \"effectively terminated\" its jurisdiction over the country and its people.  The ICC says it still has authority in the Philippines over alleged crimes committed before the country withdrew as a member. Duterte's downfall marks dramatic end to Philippines power struggle Some of Duterte's supporters rallied at the airport compound, where the former president was taken following his arrest.  \"I'm sad because I didn't think it would come to a point where he would be arrested. For me, he did a lot for our country and this is what they did to him,\" one supporter, Aikko Valdon, told the Reuters news agency.  State media said more than 370 police had been deployed to the airport and to other \"key locations\" to ensure peace was maintained.  While his supporters have criticised the arrest, activists have called it a \"historic moment\" for those who perished in his anti-drug war and their families, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) said. \"Duterte's arrest is the beginning of accountability for the mass killings that defined his brutal rule,\" said ICHRP chairman Peter Murphy. The former leader had been in Hong Kong to campaign among the large Filipino diaspora there for the 12 May mid-term elections, in which he had planned to run again for mayor of Davao.  Duterte was arrested by police in Manila airport shortly after his arrival from Hong Kong Duterte's arrest marks the \"beginning of a new chapter in Philippine history\", said political scientist Richard Heydarian. \"This is about rule of law and human rights.\" Heydarian added that authorities had arrested Duterte promptly instead of letting the matter take its course through the local courts to \"avoid political chaos\". The Duterte and Marcos families formed a formidable alliance in the last elections in 2022, where against the elder Duterte's wishes, his daughter Sara ran as Marcos Jr's vice-president instead of seeking her father's post. The relationship unravelled publicly in recent months as the two families pursued separate political agendas. Marcos initially refused to co-operate with the ICC investigation, but as his relationship with the Duterte family deteriorated, he changed his stance. The demand for justice in Duterte's drug war goes \"hand in hand\" with the political interests of President Marcos, Mr Heydarian said. Duterte served as mayor of Davao, a sprawling southern metropolis, for 22 years and has made it one of the country's safest from street crimes. He cast himself as a tough-talking anti-establishment politician to win the 2016 elections by a landslide. With fiery rhetoric, he rallied security forces to shoot drug suspects dead. More than 6,000 suspects were killed by police or unknown assailants during the campaign, but rights groups say the number could be higher.  A previous UN report found that most victims were young, poor urban males and that police, who do not need search or arrest warrants to conduct house raids, systematically forced suspects to make self-incriminating statements or risk facing lethal force. Critics said the campaign targeted street-level pushers and failed to catch big-time drug lords. Many families also claimed that the victims - their sons, brothers or husbands - were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Investigations in parliament pointed to a shadowy \"death squad\" of bounty hunters targeting drug suspects. Duterte has denied the allegations of abuse. \"Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it... I did it for my country,\" Duterte told a parliament investigation in October. \"I hate drugs, make no mistake about it.\" The ICC first took note of the alleged abuses in 2016 and started its investigation in 2021. It covered cases from November 2011, when Duterte was mayor of Davao, to March 2019, before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC. Since taking power, Marcos has scaled back Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign and promised a less violent approach to the drug problem, but hundreds of drug-related killings have been recorded, external during his administration.  Who is Rodrigo Duterte?  Duterte remains widely popular in the Philippines as he is the country's first leader from Mindanao, a region south of Manila, where many feel marginalised by the leaders in the capital. He often speaks in Cebuano, the regional language, not Tagalog, which is more widely-spoken in Manila and northern regions. When he stepped down in 2022, nearly nine in 10 Filipinos said they were satisfied with his performance as president - a score unseen among his predecessors since the restoration of democracy in 1986, according to the Social Weather Stations research institute.  His populist rhetoric and blunt statements earned him the moniker \"Donald Trump of the East\". He has called Russian President Vladimir Putin his \"idol\" and under his administration, the Philippines' pivoted foreign policy to China away from the US, its long-standing ally. Marcos restored Manila's ties with Washington and criticised the Duterte government for being \"Chinese lackeys\" as the Philippines is locked in  sea dispute with China. China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it was \"closely monitoring the development of the situation\" and warned the ICC against \"politicisation\" and \"double standards\" in the arrest of Duterte. His political heir, Sara, is tipped as a potential presidential candidate in 2028. The incumbent, Marcos, is barred by the constitution from seeking re-election.

        "title": "Why did Putin’s Russia invade Ukraine and does he want to get rid of Zelensky?",
        "content": "When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days. He wanted to overthrow the  pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence. Putin failed. But more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands, and the US - until recently Ukraine's strongest ally - has held direct talks with Russia over ending the war.  A joint US-Ukrainian proposal to pause fighting for 30 days has yet to be agreed by Russia.  Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022 As Putin launched the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, he gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history. Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government. Putin then prompted a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow. But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale. Putin had just recognised the rebel states as independent. Then, as the invasion began, he said the people there - many of whom are Russian speakers - needed protection from the Kyiv \"regime\". A day later, Putin called on Ukraine's military to \"take power into your own hands\" and target the \"gangs of drug addicts and neo-Nazis\" running the government. Putin then added another objective - to ensure Ukraine stayed neutral. He accused the Western defensive alliance, Nato, of trying to gain a foothold in Ukraine to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders. The Russian leader has long questioned Ukraine's right to exist, claiming that \"modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia\" after the communist revolution in 1917. In a long-winded 2021 essay he even suggested \"Russians and Ukrainians were one people\" dating back to the late 9th Century.  Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an \"artificial state\". Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine.  Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that \"denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation\" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion.  Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia. Fact-checking Putin's 'nonsense' history Zelensky - from comedian to wartime leader Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019 Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two. \"They want to destroy Ukraine politically, external by destroying the head of state.\" Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia. Even now, three years on, Putin refuses direct peace talks with Zelensky \"because of his illegitimacy\" - a false narrative that has been repeated by President Trump. As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution. Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead. Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line. Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997. But it was Russia who launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014. After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia. Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories \"with no aggressive intentions\". Sweden and Finland have joined Nato in the past two years precisely because of the perceived Russian threat. It is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, but there was no real prospect of this when the full-scale war began. Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: \"Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine.\" He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should \"forget about\" joining the Western alliance. Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones. Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war. Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand \"an inch to the East\". However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev said \"the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed\" at the time. Read more: What is Nato? Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine  At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian \"bullying and genocide, during the war in the east. More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. Germany's chancellor called the allegation \"ridiculous\". The Russian taunts of Nazis in charge in Kyiv are also not correct. Modern Ukraine has no far-right parties in parliament - they failed to get enough votes in the 2019 elections. On top of that, Zelensky is Jewish and many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in World War Two. Putin condemns him as a \"disgrace to the Jewish people\", but the US Holocaust Memorial Museum rejects his claims outright, saying he \"misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history\". Putin himself was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in 2024, although that has been rejected by the Kremlin. Russia's attempt to stop Ukraine leaving its sphere of influence goes back years, and its initial invasion began in 2014 when pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after months of mass demonstrations. Yanukovych had abandoned an EU deal under Putin's pressure, prompting protests that ended when snipers shot dead dozens of demonstrators. Yanukovych soon fled to Russia. Putin quickly seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Russian proxies took up arms against the government, occupying parts of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Two attempts to stop the war came to nothing. They were known as the Minsk agreements and were brokered by France, Germany and Russia itself. They reduced the scale of violence, but Zelensky has called them a trap that created a frozen conflict on Russia's terms. Both sides accused each other of violations, and the Kremlin said ultimately the failed accords were a precursor to Moscow's full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian leader has warned the Trump administration not to trust Putin: \"He broke the ceasefire, he killed our people.\" How Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed What minerals does Ukraine have? Tracking the war in maps After three years of offensives and counter-offensives, Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a war of attrition on an active front line of more than 1,000km (629 miles). Neither side has any realistic prospect of winning this war.  Russia annexed four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine after sham referendums in 2022, and yet it can really only claim to have full control of one of them, Luhansk. Ukrainian forces were able to liberate large areas of the north and parts of the south in 2022, but more recent counter-offensives have not had the same success.  They still control a small part of Russia's Kursk region after launching an offensive in August 2024, but have lost control of all major settlements there. Ukrainian troops have also lost ground in the east. Much of Russia's firepower has been turned towards the Donetsk region, as towns and villages are destroyed in a slow and grinding advance. The war is taking its toll on Russia's economy, with high interest rates and inflation and defence spending this year of at least 33% of the federal budget. Ukraine has lost a big part of its economic wealth to Russian occupation and destruction in its industrial east. Growth has been hit by attacks on its energy infrastructure. Although inflation and interest rates are high, Ukraine has secured Western aid to cover its budget deficit. How much has the US given Ukraine? Tens of thousands of people have died since Putin sent in the troops in 2022. Ukraine's president has spoken of 43,000 Ukrainian military deaths, but open source site ualosses.org suggests the number is above 70,000. More than 12,000 civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine, according to the UN. Russia rarely admits to military losses, but BBC analysis estimates that Russian deaths could range from 146,194 to 211,169. The war has forced 6.9 million Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, and a further 3.7 million to flee their homes inside Ukraine. At the start, Putin did not even call it war but a \"special military operation\". Eventually in 2024 he accepted it was, but claimed it was instigated by Kyiv or its \"Western handlers\".  Tens of thousands fighting for Russia die unnoticed on front lines Putin appears to believe that Ukraine should remain in Russia's sphere of influence because of the historical links between the two countries. From 1922-91 Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and many Ukrainians speak Russian especially in the east, including Volodymyr Zelensky who is a native speaker. Many Russians view Crimea as their own. It was annexed by Catherine the Great in 1783 and handed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Khrushchev in 1954. Ten years earlier, his predecessor Stalin had deported Crimea's Tatar population, so the majority population was ethnic Russian. Since 1991 Ukraine has been an independent state. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect. Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.

        "title": "Gene Hackman: How Alzheimer's left him alone in his final days",
        "content": "Reporters gathered outside the gated community where Hackman and his wife died Actor Gene Hackman was alone.  The two-time Academy Award winner didn't make any calls and missed meals.  Medical experts say it's possible the 95-year-old, who was in declining health and suffering from advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, did not even realise his wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living.  If he did, experts told the BBC, he likely went through various stages of confusion and grief, trying to wake her up before the disease caused him to become distracted or too overwhelmed to act - a process that likely repeated for days before he, too, died.  Officials in New Mexico say Betsy Arakawa, 65, died of a rare virus about seven days before Hackman perished on 18 February of natural causes.  The pair - and one of their dogs - were found dead in their Santa Fe home after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.  Authorities, at first, said the grim discovery was \"suspicious enough\" to launch an investigation. Their remains were discovered in advanced stages of decomposition. Arakawa was found in a bathroom with scattered pills nearby. Hackman was found near the kitchen with a cane and sunglasses. One of their three dogs was found dead in a crate.  But a police investigation found no foul play.  Instead, the case has shed light on the grim realities of Alzheimer's disease, which damages and destroys cells in one's brain over time - taking away memory and other important mental functions.  \"It's like he was living in a reel,\" Catherine V Piersol, PhD, an occupational therapist with decades of experience in dementia care, told the BBC of how Hackman may have experienced the repeated loss of his wife. This video can not be played Watch: Gene Hackman may not have known Betsy Arakawa was dead She noted patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease like the actor live in the present and are unable to both look back at moments in the past or look forward and act.  \"I imagine he would be trying to wake her up and not being successful. But then [he] could have been distracted in another room because of one of the dogs or something,\" she described.  Then later, he'd again notice his wife on the ground and would \"live through it again\", she said.  Though no one knows how Hackman spent his last days alive, the grim nature of the possibilities were discussed by authorities and the area's medical examiner. At a press conference last week, Dr Heather Jarrell, New Mexico's chief medical examiner, said Arakawa died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. Hackman's death was the result of significant heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a contributing factor.  Given Hackman's advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, it is \"quite possible that he was not aware that she [his wife] was deceased\", Dr Jarrell said. His autopsy indicated he had not eaten recently, though he showed no signs of dehydration. Officials found no evidence that he had communicated with anyone after his wife's death and could not determine whether he was able to care for himself. Ms Piersol said patients with advanced Alzheimer's aren't able to pick up on environmental cues like light and darkness, making it harder to determine when he should eat, sleep or bathe.  \"Those [cues] are oftentimes just, no longer available to people at this stage of dementia,\" she said. This video can not be played Watch: Officials reveal causes of death for Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa Dr Brendan Kelley, a neurologist who specialises in memory and cognition at UT Southwestern Medical Center, explained why Hackman may also not have been able to call authorities for help. He said Alzheimer's disease can leave patients caught between emotional discomfort and the inability to act on it. \"A person might feel worried or frightened, but at the same time they might not be capable to take the actions that you or I might normally think to do in order to alleviate that worry or concern, such as calling somebody else, or going to speak to a neighbour.\" Dr Kelley says Alzheimer's patients experience emotions like pain and sadness, and experience physical needs like hunger and thirst, it's just harder for them to identify what they are feeling. He said missing meals could also increase levels of confusion and agitation. The couple's deaths and the startling details of Hackman living in the home for a week after his wife's passing has shocked the Santa Fe area, where the couple had lived for more than 20 years.  \"It's just absolutely devastating,\" says Jeffery Gomez, a long-time resident of the city, who remembers seeing Hackman around town in his different cars, always with a smile on his face. His partner, Linda, said the details were triggering, explaining she cared for her elderly mother with dementia. \"Even when you have help, it's a lot,\" she said.  \"We know Gene and his wife were very private people and she was probably trying to shield him from the public,\" she added, \"but the thought of doing that alone? It's a lot to shoulder.\" Laura N Gitlin, PhD, a behavioural scientist who researches ways to support caregivers told the BBC, this is becoming a common problem among caregivers.  \"With the aging of a population, we also simultaneously have a shrinking of the number of people in the family, number of children, or relatives who live nearby,\" she explained.  Ms Gitlin noted along with there being fewer caregivers, there is less support for these individuals on making big decisions - such as when it's time to place a loved one in a home instead of caring for them by yourself.  Jeffery Gomez said he couldn't understand how no one checked in on the couple for such a long while.   \"It breaks my heart he was alone so long.\"  A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

        "content": " The premier of Ontario threatens to cut off power to the US if its trade war escalates. Canada's most populous province has imposed a twenty-five percent surcharge on electricity exports to the United States in response to tariffs imposed by Washington. The premier of Ontario, Doug Ford, said he would be prepared to cut off power supplies altogether unless the US changed course. He said the surcharge would raise a total of up to four hundred thousand dollars a day from the states of New York, Michigan and Minnesota. On Sunday, Canada's next Prime Minister, Mark Carney, said the national government was right to retaliate against US tariffs. He said Canada would maintain its own duties on US goods until the Americans showed some respect. We hear from Yasir Naqvi, from Mr Carney's Liberal Party.

        "title": "US stocks plunge as fears grow over impact of tariffs",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: How Trumpâs stock market rhetoric has shifted over the years A sell-off in global shares eased in Europe on Tuesday following a sharp fall in US stocks that came as investors raised concerns about the negative economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. It followed the president saying in a TV interview that the world's biggest economy was in a \"period of transition\", when asked about suggestions of a potential recession. Since those remarks were broadcast on Sunday, top Trump officials and advisers have sought to calm investor fears. The US S&P 500 share index fell nearly 3% on Monday, but in Europe most of the major markets opened little changed.  In a Fox News interview broadcast at the weekend but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge concerns about the economy.  \"I hate to predict things like that,\" he said. \"There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.\" Charu Chanana, an investment strategist at investment bank Saxo, told the BBC:  \"The previous notion of Trump being a stock market president is being re-evaluated.\" On Monday in New York, the S&P 500, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the US, ended the trading day 2.7% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq share index was hit particularly hard, sinking 4%. Tesla shares fell by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia was down more than 5%. Other major tech stocks including Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also fell sharply. On Tuesday, Asian stocks fell sharply at first before recovering. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi ended 1.3% lower. The dollar slid further against the pound and the euro on Tuesday, having fallen sharply since the beginning of the month. However, there was little sign of the turbulence spilling into Europe. While the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the UK, dipped 0.1%, Germany's Dax index rose 0.4% and the French Cac 40 climbed 0.2%. Stocks slide as Trump warns of US economy 'transition' Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs \"Trump is keeping political leaders guessing regarding his next moves on tariffs, but the problem is that he's also keeping investors guessing and that's reflected in the dire market mood,\" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade. \"Whilst recession talk may be premature, the mere prospect of this coming to fruition is enough to put traders into a defensive mindset.\" Ruth Foxe-Blader of Foxe Capital told the BBC's Today programme that Monday had been a \"very difficult and chaotic day for the stock market in the US\" and \"the markets hate chaos\". She said investors were reacting to Trump's policies - but also selling tech stocks they felt were overvalued. Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the drop in Tesla share price \"comes down to hard numbers\" with new orders halving in Europe and China over the past year. She added there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics \"having a brand impact\", but \"there's other angles\" including competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and investors \"getting more worried about an economic slowdown\". After trading closed on Monday, a White House official told reporters: \"We're seeing a strong divergence between [the] animal spirits of the stock market and what we're actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders.\" They added: \"The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what's in store for the economy in the medium to long term.\" In a separate statement later in the day, White House spokesman Kush Desai said \"industry leaders\" had responded to Trump's agenda, including tariffs, \"with trillions in investment commitments\". Last week, the main US markets fell back to the level seen before Trump's election victory last November, which had initially been welcomed by investors due to hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation. Investors fear Trump's tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and dent growth in the world's largest economy. The president introduced the measures after accusing China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. More than 80% of USAID programmes 'officially ending'  Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on Ontario says it will slap a 25% surcharge on US-bound electricity Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors were initially optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war. He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets. \"It's a complete change in what the market expected,\" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending due to uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth. But Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to President Trump, has pushed back against those projecting this bleak outlook.  In an interview with CNBC, Hassett said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy and that that tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China were already bringing manufacturing and jobs to the United States.  \"There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward,\" he said.  He admitted there were some \"blips in the data\" for this quarter, which he pinned on the timing of Trump's tariffs and the \"Biden inheritance\".

        "title": "Elon Musk says X hit by 'cyber-attack' as thousands report outage",
        "content": "Experts have cast doubt on Elon Musk's claim that a large-scale outage which hit X was caused by hackers in Ukraine. Platform monitor Downdetector says it had more than 1.6 million reports of problems with the social media site from users around the world on Monday. \"We're not sure exactly what happened but there was a massive cyber-attack to try and bring down the X system with IP [Internet Protocol] addresses originating in the Ukraine area,\" Musk said in an interview with the Fox Business channel. However, Ciaran Martin, professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government told the BBC that explanation was \"wholly unconvincing\" and \"pretty much garbage.\" Prof Martin - former head of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre - says it looks as if X was targeted by what's known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where hackers flood a server with internet traffic to prevent users from connecting to a website. \"It's not that sophisticated - it's a very old technique,\" Mr Martin told Radio 4's Today programme. \"I can't think of a company of the size and standing internationally of X that's fallen over to a DDoS attack for a very long time,\" he added. He said the incident at X \"doesn't reflect well on their cyber security.\" Many users trying to access the platform and refresh feeds on its app and desktop site during Monday's outages were met with a loading icon. Musk, who has been a frequent critic of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelensky, has offered no evidence to support his claim and did not say whether or not he thought state actors were involved. He posted on X that \"either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved\". But Prof Martin said tracing IP addresses \"tells you absolutely nothing,\" because hackers in this situation would hijack devices from all over the world. The BBC has approached the Ukrainian embassy in Washington DC for comment. Alp Toker, director of Netblocks, which monitors the connectivity of web services, said its own metrics suggested the outages could well be linked to a cyber attack. \"What we've been seeing is consistent with what we've seen in past denial of service attacks, rather than a configuration or coding error in the platform,\" he told the BBC. He said the organisation has seen several major outages spanning more than six hours on Monday, \"each having global impact\". \"This is amongst the longest X/Twitter outages we've tracked in terms of duration, and the pattern is consistent with a denial of service attack targeting X's infrastructure at scale,\" he added. Musk has previously claimed that the platform has been targeted by DDoS attacks, but these have not been confirmed. Like all major social networks, X is a regular target for disruptive and attention seeking attacks.  But X has a track record of falling due to these attacks much more than other larger sites like Facebook and Instagram.  In 2023, a small group of hackers called Anonymous Sudan took the site offline in more than a dozen countries for hours in an attempt to pressurise Elon Musk into launching his Starlink service in their country.  Two men were arrested, external in 2024 for being the ringleaders of the group - showing that hackers can disrupt X with DDoS attacks from anywhere in the world with the right tools and expertise. Cyber specialists are seeing a \"sharp rise\" in DDoS attacks which are becoming \"an increasingly popular tool\" for criminals, according to Sian John, chief technology officer at cyber security company NCC Group. \"Businesses that store large amounts of sensitive data, like tech firms, financial institutions, and healthcare providers, are frequent targets,\" she said. \"But any organisation with an online presence is at risk.\" Additional reporting by Joe Tidy, Imran Rahman-Jones and Chris Vallance.

        "title": "Major cuts at NHS HQ as more directors stand down",
        "content": "NHS England's outgoing chief executive Amanda Pritchard has already resigned  Major cutbacks are planned at NHS England as part of government plans to \"avoid duplication\" with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). It means around 6,500 jobs are at risk, about half the workforce at NHS England, with the aim of saving Â£175 million a year. The news comes as it emerged three more NHS England board members will leave. This follows recent announcements that chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis will quit. NHS England was established in 2013 by former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley to give it greater independence and autonomy.   Government sources have said the overall plan is to bring NHS England much closer to the DHSC and reallocate resources from central administration to regional health boards. Sir Jim Mackey, the incoming interim chief executive due to replace Ms Pritchard from April, is set to oversee \"a transition team\" that will push through the \"radical reduction and reshaping of the centre with the DHSC\".  The plan will seek to reduce the duplication of jobs between the two organisations. Some of the job cuts could also be made within the DHSC. NHS England chief financial officer Julian Kelly, chief operating officer Emily Lawson, and chief delivery officer Steve Russell collectively announced their decision to stand down at the end of March on Monday. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We are entering a period of critical transformation for our NHS. With a stronger relationship between the department and NHS England we will all work together to meet the scale of the challenge.\" In an email to staff, Ms Pritchard added she believed it was the right time for \"radical reform of the size and functions\" of NHS England. But she added: \"I know this news will be very unsettling. The transition team will develop plans over the coming weeks and we know that colleagues will want this to be completed as soon as possible to provide future certainty.\" Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "What we know about the North Sea oil tanker collision",
        "content": "This video can not be played BBC Verify breaks down moments before cargo ship, tanker collision One crew member is missing, presumed dead, while more than 30 people have been rescued after a cargo ship, the Solong, struck an oil tanker, the Stena Immaculate, in the North Sea off the east coast of England on Monday. It is unclear how much fuel has been released into the sea, but early assessments suggest the impact is limited, with some fuel having burned off and evaporated. The Solong was still on fire on Wednesday, while the fire on the Stena Immaculate has been extinguished, according to the ship's co-owner. Despite initial fears of potentially devastating environmental damage, air quality tests have registered no toxins so far. A 59-year-old Russian national - who, according to the Solong's owners, is the ship's captain - was arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter on Tuesday. This video can not be played Watch moment cargo ship and oil tanker collide in North Sea The Portuguese-flagged Solong struck the larger oil tanker in waters off Hull just before 10:00 on Monday. The Stena Immaculate had been anchored there after making its way to Hull from a Greek port. The US-flagged ship had been transporting jet fuel for the US military. The Solong container ship had been making its way south to the Netherlands from Grangemouth in Scotland. An American sailor from the Stena Immaculate described the point of collision to the BBC's US partner CBS. He said \"a massive ship came from out of the blue\" and those on board only had seconds to react. He did not give his name as crew are not currently allowed to speak to the media. The sailor said flames immediately began erupting from the vessel following the crash. One of the men who was on the Stena Immaculate told the BBC the Solong collided with the anchored Stena Immaculate at 16 knots (around 18mph).  Data from tracking site MarineTraffic appears to indicate that one ship was moving and the other was nearly stationary when the collision happened. It is still unclear what caused the cargo ship to strike the oil tanker. Martyn Boyers, the chief executive of the port of Grimsby East, told Sky News the area had been \"very foggy\" on Monday morning, which may have contributed to visibility issues. Meanwhile a rescuer told The Times the fog was so thick during the initial search that crews could \"not see a thing\". As of Wednesday afternoon, fire on the Solong has diminished but continues to emit smoke with occasional reports of flames, according to its owner Ernst Russ.  It said the Solong has separated from the Stena Immaculate and has drifted south as marine firefighting crafts tackle the blaze. The fire onboard the Stena Immaculate had been extinguished as of Wednesday afternoon, according to its co-owner Stena Bulk. It is currently safe at anchor, and over the next few days the owners will decide what to do with the ship, it added. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there have been no further reports of pollution from either vessel.  The UK's transport secretary has said the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch has begun a preliminary assessment of the crash, and that early indications suggested both vessels were not expected to sink.  Earlier, an exclusion zone of 1km radius was put in place around both vessels. One of the 14 Solong crew members is still missing and presumed dead, with the search called off on Monday night after \"an extensive search\", said the coastguard. They have not yet been identified. Whitehall sources have told BBC News there were Russians and Filipinos among the Solong's crew.  Ernst Russ, the German owners of the Solong, said their \"first thoughts\" were with the family of the missing crew member \"at this uncertain and distressing time\". They confirmed the captain of the ship had been arrested and said that he, along with the rest of the crew, were assisting the investigation. Humberside Police's senior investigating officer Detective Chief Supt Craig Nicholson said specialist officers have been tasked with making contact with the missing sailor's family and supporting them. It is thought that all 23 crew on board the Stenna Immaculate were Americans who are currently in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due course.   The entire crew managed to evacuate safely during the disaster. The Stena sailor said after the Solong crashed into them, the crew on board the tanker had tried to fight the fires,  but they realised it was futile - so they made the decision to abandon ship. Crew members grabbed their essential belongings from their cabins - and after everyone was accounted for-  boarded the lifeboat together. Their captain was the last person to leave the ship, the sailor said. He described flames licking at the crew as they headed for the lifeboats. Some even had their hair singed. The whole process took about 30 minutes, he told CBS. A total of 36 crew members from both vessels were brought back to shore. One person was taken to hospital. The collision took place about 13 miles (20km) off the East Yorkshire coast, near Hull and Grimsby, in a busy shipping area. The Stena Immaculate was anchored and drifting at a speed of 0.1 knots at 09:48 GMT on Monday, according to ship tracking site MarineTraffic.  The tanker had been anchored there since Sunday evening, while the Solong had been approaching from the north after setting off from Grangemouth in Scotland on the same night. The vessels are the oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate and a cargo ship called Solong. Here is a graphic to show how they compare: The Stena Immaculate is a US-flagged ship that was transporting jet fuel for the US military. Crowley, the firm which manages the ship, said it was unclear how much fuel might have been released but the tanker had been carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel when it was struck. Erik Hanel, who runs the ship's co-owner Swedish firm Stena Bulk, said the jet fuel was spread among 18 containers and either one or two have been damaged. The Solong had been making its way south from the Scottish port of Grangemouth to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.  Operator Ernst Russ said on Tuesday the ship had not been carrying containers of sodium cyanide - which had been previously reported. The Stena Immaculate's owner confirmed at least one fuel tank had ruptured on the tanker. But it's unknown how much jet fuel has entered the water. Jet fuel is toxic and if ingested can kill marine organisms, which can then become harmful to seabirds that feed on them.  Some of the fuel has been burnt off, but jet fuel has a high boiling point, so evaporates slowly. Crowley said an initial review showed impacts on the sea had been \"limited due to exposure to the fire and evaporation\" of the fuel. They did not say that the fire on board had been put out. Experts say the extent of the risk will depend on how much fuel has leaked out and the speed at which authorities contain the spill. It also depends on natural conditions, such as how quickly bacteria can break down the liquid. Local wildlife trusts have warned of a potentially \"devastating\" impact on local habitats and species including threatened seabird colonies, grey seals, harbour porpoises, fish and minke whales. Solong's owners said they had a team \"actively engaged\" with local authorities and would work with clean-up teams to \"mitigate further impacts on the marine environment\". Chief Coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said in a statement on Wednesday evening that aerial surveillance flights \"have not indicated any pollution on the surface of the water attributable to either of the casualty vessels\". The clean-up needs to start \"as quickly as possible\", said Dr Paul Johnson at the University of Exeter's Greenpeace laboratories. He told the BBC it would be \"very difficult, very time consuming\" and require \"considerable investment in heavy equipment\". The operation is still focused on containment of the ships. But animal charities have said they are on standby to treat any injured birds and marine life that wash ashore. The UK is responsible for responding to marine pollution up to 200 nautical miles from land, with a specialist coastguard team expected to lead the effort. After finding the source of the spill, teams will work to stop the fuel from spreading using a variety of methods. Options include deploying inflatable tubes called booms, which are hundreds of metres in length and laid on the water's surface to stop the oil from spreading.  Teams could also use mechanical devices called skimmers, which are designed to float on the surface and pump contained oil into waste storage units. Chemical dispersion could also be used. This involves spraying a specially formulated dispersant from modified aircraft or boats which breaks the oil into smaller droplets that sink.

        "title": "Mike Amesbury: Ex-Labour MP to stand down over assault conviction",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Convicted MP Mike Amesbury says he'll resign at the \"earliest opportunity\" Former Labour MP Mike Amesbury has said he will stand down from parliament after being given a prison sentence for repeatedly punching a constituent. The Runcorn and Helsby MP has told the BBC he will begin the \"statutory process\" of winding up his office before resigning as an MP \"as soon as possible\". His resignation will trigger the first by-election of Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government. Amesbury was given a 10-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted assaulting Paul Fellows.  In his first interview since the sentencing, Amesbury said he \"regrets\" attacking Mr Fellows \"every moment, every day\". But Amesbury told the BBC he would have tried to remain an MP - a job he said was his \"calling\" - had he been given a lighter community sentence.  \"I would have continued to serve my constituents, I was elected just seven or eight months ago,\" he said. \"And that would have been my intention, if I was able to, to continue.\" Under parliamentary rules, if an MP receives a custodial sentence, a \"recall petition\" is triggered. If at least 10% of his constituents had voted to remove Amesbury, a by-election would have been called - potentially ousting him as MP. Mike Amesbury: 'He did some good but he must go' Convicted MP Mike Amesbury: What happens now? Parliament to prison: Charting MP's fall from grace Asked about his future, Amesbury told the BBC: \"I'm going to step aside at the earliest opportunity. \"I've got processes I must go through - there's a statutory process in terms of redundancies,\" he said. Amesbury described the fallout from his court case as \"difficult\", but said he \"owns\" his mistake. Amesbury defended continuing to take his MP wages - despite not appearing in House of Commons debates since the video of him punching Mr Fellows first surfaced in October 2024. He told the BBC he carried out casework for his constituents, even while behind bars. \"I actually picked up some casework in prison,\" Amesbury said, as his office manager forwarded on \"correspondence\". \"Life doesn't stop as an MP,\" he added. Amesbury spent three nights in jail following his 10-week sentence being handed down at Chester Magistrates' Court on 24 February. Chester Crown Court later suspended his sentence, allowing him to serve his time in the community instead of behind bars. As part of his suspended sentence, Amesbury must carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, undertake an alcohol monitoring programme, go on an anger management course and carry out 20 days of rehabilitation work. Campaigners had called for Amesbury to be stripped of his wages during his trial and imprisonment.  The Independent Parliament Standards Authority (IPSA), which regulates MPs' pay, said the rules mean that until a member is suspended as a result of a House of Commons disciplinary procedure they must be paid their salary. Asked how he responded to people who might think he had been treated lightly in having his sentence suspended, Amesbury said he had been \"punished accordingly\".  \"I pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity in terms of the law,\" Amesbury said. He told the BBC he is \"going to lose the family home\", his livelihood and walk away with a criminal record. \"If people think that's lightly, so be it.\" Video footage of the assault, played in court, showed Amesbury punching Mr Fellows in the head, knocking him to the ground. The politician then hit him at least five more times and swore at him. Amesbury was then heard saying: \"You won't threaten your MP again, will you?\" The court heard that Amesbury told the police he had been approached by a man \"shouting and screaming\", and said that, because he was terrified and the other man's \"arms were swinging\", he felt he had no option but to \"defend\" himself. Despite the judge calling his comments \"a pack of lies\", Amesbury maintains he \"felt threatened\" by Mr Fellows. In the days leading up to the incident Amesbury said he had been dealing with death threats and the impact of a stalker which raised his \"anxiety levels\". Threats and abuse \"make you on edge\", Amesbury said, noting that two MPs - Jo Cox and Sir David Amess - were murdered in the past decade. \"So, when someone approached me at ten past two in the morning it was quite natural to be on edge and anxious - and I got it wrong,\" he said. He said he should have walked away, adding: \"I just saw red - a moment of madness which I will regret for the rest of my life.\" He added he would like to apologise to Mr Fellows in person, but held back as the legal process unfolded. The BBC has also been in contact with Mr Fellows. Mr Fellows previously told the Mail on Sunday, external: \"I've not had any kind of personal apology, anything in either writing or trying to contact me.  \"I felt like it was just purely for the media and the judge.\" In the same interview, Mr Fellows said Amesbury \"could have killed me and deserves to be in prison\".

        "title": "Former central bank boss becomes Canada's next leader",
        "content": " Canada's next prime minister, Mark Carney, has denounced US tariffs and Donald Trump's threat to make Canada the \"51st state\". Canada's next PM, former central bank governor Mark Carney, has swapped his former persona as a central bank governor for fighting talk against the US administration led by Donald Trump and the tariffs its seeking to impose on trade partners. Mr Carney has very little political experience - he has never been elected as an MP, let alone served in a cabinet post. But as Governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and Governor of the Bank of England during the Brexit negotiations, he has a long track record in global finance during times of economic turbulence. Can he face down the Trump administration's tariffs?

        "title": "Dad of detained US tourist urges care on visa requirements",
        "content": "Becky Burke had planned a \"life-changing\" trip around North America  A Welsh woman has spoken about being held in \"horrendous\" conditions after she was accused of \"violating\" her visa and was stopped at the US border.  Becky Burke, 28, has spent 11 days in a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing centre in Washington State and was also denied entry into Canada, over a \"visa mix-up\".  Speaking to the BBC, Ms Burke said: \"They keep saying in all their booklets that this is not a prison. It's hard to distinguish from my conception of a prison.\" ICE said: \"All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States regardless of nationality.\" ICE said she was being detained at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. Her father, Paul Burke, has urged travellers to be \"very careful\" about their visa requirements. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it could not comment on specific cases for privacy reasons, but added: \"All persons arriving at a port-of-entry to the United States are subject to inspection. \"CBP officers treat all travellers with integrity, respect, professionalism and according to law. \"In the event a foreign national is found inadmissible to the United States, CBP will provide the foreign national an opportunity to procure travel to his or her home country. \"If the foreign national is unable to do so, he or she will be turned over to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) for repatriation.\" The UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) confirmed it was supporting a British national. Ms Burke, an artist from Portskewett, Monmouthshire, began backpacking around the US on 7 January. She had flown from New York to Portland, Oregon, where she spent time with a host family, helping with household chores in return for accommodation. At the end of February she travelled to Seattle with plans to travel to Vancouver in Canada to stay with another family. However, when she reached the border, Mr Burke said the Canadian authorities denied her entry as they were concerned she may try to work illegally. She described how she spent six hours at the border, waiting while officials were \"trying to determine if what I had been doing in America counted as work\". She said she was \"interrogated\" and, despite explaining she was \"not paid at all\", it was decided she had \"violated\" her visa. Ms Burke said she was being held in a dormitory of 110 people in a \"maxed out\" immigration detention centre in Tacoma, Washington. \"They wake us up at 6:30am. There is never enough time to sleep. It's so cold,\" she said.  \"I wear the same jumper for a week. They're short or out of stuff, like blankets and extra clothes. I have one towel.\" She added many of the people she had met were \"stuck\" at the centre, separated from their families - in some cases, for years. \"Everyone is actually really shocked when I explain my situation,\" she added. \"I came to the US for the first time two years ago... I had a great time, that's why I wanted to come back again. I love nature and hiking. Now I see no nature in here at all.\" Immigration experts tell the BBC that once Ms Burke informed Canadian officials of her plans and they denied her entry, a suspension of her visa waiver and detention on the US side was probably unavoidable. Many countries strictly interpret what constitutes compensated work - even if no money changes hands. And under the best of circumstances, processing within by the US immigration system can move slowly. Circumstances are far from usual in the US at the moment, however. The Trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement across the US, so these experts caution that anyone entering the country should be careful to ensure that all their documents are in order and that they are clear about their intentions upon entering the country. American immigration policy and enforcement is changing under the new administration, and there is less tolerance for even seemingly honest mistakes. Such advice comes too late for Ms Burke, who is currently caught in a bureaucratic limbo. She's trying to stay detached from this, trying to see this as an experience to talk to the people in there and share their stories as well. It's an unusual circumstance - she says she is unlike most of the more than 100 detainees in her building in Tacoma - many of whom have been held for months or even years. She wants to travel back to her home in the UK as soon as possible, while others she speaks to, from places like Mexico, Brazil and Russia, have family in the US and are unwilling or unable to return to their home nations. According to the experts, we probably won't have any advance notice of when she is allowed to get on a plane and leave. It could happen, and her family find out about it after the fact. Couple held in Iran need 'prompt' UK action, says Nazanin's husband 'Heartbreaking' conditions at US migrant camp Enduring mystery of New York icon with Welsh owner Ms Burke's dad described the situation as a misunderstanding of her accommodation arrangements, which were \"just like a cultural exchange\". He said Ms Burke got free accommodation for helping host families \"around the house\", which he believes authorities may have suspected broke the terms of her tourist visa. Mr Burke told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast he could not understand why his daughter was \"locked up and she's in an orange prison jumpsuit whilst the paperwork gets sorted out\". He said what was meant to be a life-changing backpacking trip \"has turned into a nightmare\".  He added: \"At first she was just distraught. She was inconsolable. She is allowed to ring out using a shared iPad but we can't call her.\" The dad said, as their family is not American, they cannot add money to Ms Burke's inmate account for her to buy essentials, so they have reached out to some American friends to help. Mr Burke said his daughter just wants to come home and has asked for voluntary departure but it has been \"radio silence\". The family have been told voluntary departure has to be approved by a judge, but added they do not know \"how to make that happen\".  Ms Burke's family says she was \"inconsolable\" at first and just wants to come home Ms Burke's parents said they were in daily contact with the British consulate in San Francisco, which is the nearest one to the detention facility, but claimed \"official channels can't get a clear answer about what is going on\". Melissa Chavin, a US immigration lawyer based in London, said Ms Burke could be released either through voluntary departure or expedited removal, but the process of appearing in front of a judge as part of voluntary departure could be delayed because several dozen of the approximately 700 immigration judges had resigned or been fired by the Trump administration. Trump won the US presidential election last November after promising to strengthen US borders and rigorously enforce immigration law. Ms Chavin said expedited removal â which allows officials to quickly deport non citizens â had been expanded under President Trump and could now happen anywhere in the country as opposed to within 100 miles of the border. \"That could work out well for [Ms Burke] â in that she could leave quicker,\" Ms Chavin said, adding that it would also come with a five-year ban on travelling to the United States. She also urged people travelling to the United States to ensure they can pay for their own accommodation. Ms Burke said she planned the trip before Trump's presidency, but was \"cautious\" and aware she would need to prove that she did not intend to stay in the country. She added she was \"lucky\" compared to some people who were fighting to remain in the country, and were \"stuck between a rock and a hard place\". \"Everyone's story is really sad. No one deserves to be in here. Everyone detained here is so nice,\" she said. Mr Burke said his daughter had to swap her clothes for an orange jumpsuit  Ms Burke had organised some of her trip through Workaway, which matches hosts with travellers. A spokesperson for the company said it was \"very sad\" to hear about what had happened but that it was \"the responsibility of the host and person travelling to make sure they are within the law, have the correct visa or permit and insurance in place before travelling\". \"Unfortunately if these warning are not followed and someone attempts to enter the United States without the correct permissions or visas in place then the US border control are within their rights to refuse entry.\" Ms Burke's family have been in touch with Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes, who has raised the case with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty. \"I am deeply concerned about my constituent's welfare and the distress this situation is causing her and her family,\" said Ms Fookes.

        "title": "South Sudan tensions: US orders non-emergency staff to leave",
        "content": "Sporadic violence has continued in parts of South Sudan since the peace deal was signed in 2018 The United States has ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave, amid rising tensions in the country. Fighting in recent days has threatened an already fragile peace deal between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar. The two leaders signed a peace agreement in 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, but their relationship has remained fraught. On Sunday, the US State Department said that fighting was ongoing in South Sudan between various political and ethnic groups and that \"weapons are readily available to the population\". \"Due to the risks in the country, on March 08, 2025, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government employees,\" it said. The UN human rights commission for South Sudan on Saturday warned of an \"alarming regression\" that threatened to undo years of progress towards peace. President Kiir has called for calm and made an assurance that the country would not return to war. In an escalation of the tensions, a UN helicopter that had been evacuating members of the national army was shot at on Friday, killing several people, including one crew member. Earlier in the week, the deputy chief of the army and two ministers allied to Machar were arrested by security forces, which an opposition spokesman termed a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal. The arrests of the Machar-allied officials followed clashes in the country's Upper Nile state between government forces and a militia known as the White Army, which had fought alongside Machar during the civil war. South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. But just two years later, following a rift between Kiir and Machar, the country descended into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed. The 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented â including a new constitution, an election, and the reunification of armed groups into a single army. Sporadic violence between ethnic or local groups has continued in parts of the country.

        "title": "Oil tanker and cargo vessel collide in North Sea",
        "content": "This video can not be played Footage shows an oil tanker and a cargo vessel on fire in the North Sea Fires are still burning on an oil tanker carrying jet fuel and a cargo ship carrying highly toxic chemicals that collided in the North Sea on Monday morning. One crew member is still unaccounted for and the search has been called off after \"an extensive search\", HM Coastguard said. The collision involved the US-registered Stena Immaculate - which was transporting fuel on behalf of the US military - and the Portuguese-flagged Solong. Coastguard Divisional Commander Matthew Atkinson said 36 people had been rescued, with one person taken to hospital. The missing crew member had been onboard the Solong, he said. One of the men who was on the oil tanker told BBC News that the Solong came out of the blue and collided with the Stena Immaculate at 16 knots.  The crew scrambled to the life rafts taking only what they had on them. Efforts to assess any environmental damage are still ongoing after it was confirmed some jet fuel had leaked into the sea off the Humber Estuary.  Maritime firm Crowley, which manages the Stena Immaculate, said there had been \"multiple explosions onboard\" when the vessel suffered a ruptured cargo tank. A US official confirmed the tanker had been carrying jet fuel \"in support of the Department of Defense\" but said the incident would not impact operations or combat readiness. A Coastguard rescue helicopter was sent to the scene, as well as four lifeboats and nearby vessels with fire-fighting capability. Svitzer managing director Michael Paterson said the marine services group had sent  four boats which had been \"firefighting since they arrived and dealing with the flames\". \"The oil and jet fuel presents a problem for them. It's obviously flammable, but there's also fumes and toxins,\" he said. \"The priority for us was to save the crew. I've seen some serious incidents, but this is one of the most serious.\" The collision between the two vessels took place off the coast of East Yorkshire, near Hull The Marine Accident Investigation Branch said a team of inspectors and support staff had started gathering evidence and was undertaking a preliminary assessment to determine its next steps. Divisional Commander Atkinson said: \"An assessment of any required counter pollution response is being carried out by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.   \"The Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention is working with the salvors and insurance companies.\" The transport secretary paid tribute to the efforts of the coastguard, RNLI and emergency services. Heidi Alexander said: \"They were on the scene swiftly, have helped rescue those in immediate danger and I know they will continue to work tirelessly over the coming days.\" According to MarineTraffic, the Stena Immaculate had travelled from the Greek port of Agioi Theodoroi and was anchored by the Humber Estuary. The Solong had been sailing from the Scottish port of Grangemouth to Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. The cargo ship had been carrying 15 containers of the chemical sodium cyanide when it collided with the tanker. Sodium cyanide has a variety of commercial uses, from being used to plate metals to dye production. It is highly soluble in water and can be toxic as it affects the uptake of oxygen. It is not clear whether any sodium cyanide from the cargo ship has leaked into the sea. But if it has come into contact with water, \"there is a risk of some hydrogen cyanide gas being produced which could present a risk to any of those involved in rescue\", according to Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at Leeds University. Some of the crew members were met by emergency services at Grimsby docks The Stena Immaculate had been carrying jet fuel when it was hit, said Crowley.  Jet fuel has a high boiling point, so it will evaporate slowly. It is also relatively toxic, so marine life that comes into contact with it may be killed. Greenpeace said it was \"extremely concerned\" about \"multiple toxic hazards\" from the North Sea ship collision. Downing Street said details of the cause of the collision were \"still becoming clear\". The prime minister's official spokesman said it was an \"extremely concerning situation\". He said: \"We thank the emergency services for their rapid response. I understand the Department for Transport is working closely with the coastguard to help support the response to the incident.\" P&O Ferries said the Humber Estuary remained closed to all traffic and departure times from Hull and Rotterdam remained unconfirmed on Monday evening.

        "title": "Five years on: How Covid impacted the lives of young people",
        "content": "Part of Other Side of the Story Save to My Bitesize In March 2020, life as we know it changed after Covid sent the world into lockdown. Five years on, we caught up with a group of young people who were in school and college in 2020 to find out how the pandemic impacted their use of social media, and how it affected their relationship with news. Tasha was in her final year of sixth form when the lockdown was announced. She told us that she started spending more time on social media as a result, and this changed how she felt about the media: âAt the time when I looked on social media there were a lot of people catastrophising about the whole Covid situation and being like âoh, this is it, this is the end of the worldâ and stuff like that.â She added: âI think because of the amount of time I was spending on social media it made me more sceptical of what was fake and what was real newsâ¦it made me wiser at sorting out âok, this is a headline thatâs intended to be a bit fearmongering'â¦It definitely altered my way of thinking in terms of how I read the news and keep updated about things.â This video can not be played At the time when I looked on social media, there was just a lot of people catastrophising about the whole Covid situation. So being like, 'oh, this is it, the end of the world' and stuff like that. I think because of the amount of time that I was spending on social media, it made me more sceptical of what was fake and what was real news. And I think because of the amount of time I did spend on there, it made me wiser in like sorting out, okay, this is a headline that intends to be a bit fearmongering and stuff like that and this is headline that is meant to be more informational or informative, Soâ¦it definitely altered my way of thinking in terms of the how I read the news and keep updated about things. Jess, who was in Year 10 in March 2020, told us that she also started questioning whether what she was reading was true. âThe media's what you usually go to to find out what's happening in the world, and the majority of the time you do just assume it to be the truth. When thereâs tens of thousands of stories floating around, whether thatâs on the TV, on the news, on your phone, on a video that youâre just scrolling past you automatically start questioning it. âEveryone was speculating and everyone was taking one piece of a story and adding to it, or taking away from it and then you end up with a completely different story to what it started off with.â Jess would then use other sources to try to work out if what she was reading was true. She told us: âIâd look at the media to see if they [were] broadcasting it and if the story is as bigâ¦or if itâs just one video on your phone thatâs got a few hundred likes.â This video can not be played At the end of the day, the media is what you usually go to, to find out what's happening in the world. And majority of the time you do just assume it to be the truth. And when there's tens of thousands of stories floating around, whether that's on the TV, on the news, just on your phone, on a video that you just scrolling past, you automatically start questioning it, and it just makes you really wonder what's actually going on. So you don't really have, you feel like you don't know anything about Covid because instead of knowing what's going on with it, you know, a million things that might not even be true. Everyone was speculating, and everyone was taking one piece of a story and adding to it or taking away from it, and then you end up with a completely different story to what it started off with. Look at the media and see if they're broadcasting it, if the story is as big as what it is, or if it's just one video on your phone that's got a few hundred likes. Kevonte, who was in high school five years ago, said he found himself constantly scrolling through social media during lockdown. He believes that the pandemic has had a lasting impact on his life: âIt has changed my outlook on life. It is something that I could sit down and think back to as a very traumatic period of time of life. I never literally [thought I'd witness] the world come to a complete stop.â Watch the full video to hear more young people talk about their experiences of the pandemic.

        "title": "Keir Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not \"shrug its shoulders and look away\".  Addressing Labour MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister said the current welfare system was \"the worst of all worlds\", discouraging people from working while producing a \"spiralling bill\".  The comments come as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall prepares to set out changes to the welfare system and cut the benefits bill in the coming weeks. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Changes likely to be announced in the coming days include restrictions on eligibility for the Personal Independent Payment, which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit.  There is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against \"draconian cuts\" that risk \"pushing disabled people into poverty\". Maskell told the BBC she had picked up \"deep, deep concern\" among Labour MPs. She said: \"I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.\" Another Labour MP, Neil Duncan-Jordan, also expressed concern, telling Newsnight: \"If we are going to make poor people poorer then there will be a number of MPs who won't be able to sign up to that. \"It feels like it could be a re-run of austerity and I'm worried about that.\" How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall? Some on benefits are 'taking the mickey', says minister Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments However, other sections of the Parliamentary Labour Party are calling for change.  The Get Britain Working group of 36 Labour MPs has said the government has a \"moral duty\" to help long-term sick and disabled people to work if they can. In a letter to Kendall, the MPs said the country faced \"hard choices\" to overcome a \"crisis of economic inactivity\". Speaking at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Sir Keir said: \"We've found ourselves in a worst of all worlds situation - with the wrong incentives - discouraging people from working, the taxpayer funding a spiralling bill. \"A wasted generation, one-in-eight young people not in education, employment or training, and the people who really need that safety net still not always getting the dignity they deserve. \"That's unsustainable, it's indefensible and it is unfair, people feel that in their bones. \"So, this needs to be our offer to people up and down the country: If you can work, we will make work pay - if you need help, that safety net will be there for you.  \"But this is the Labour Party - we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the dignity of every worker.\" A number of MPs leaving the meeting said they had been satisfied with the prime minister's words.  One said they accepted that welfare reform had to happen and were reassured that he had said it had to be done with Labour values and through the dignity of work. However, another said constituents were frightened and needed to know that support would be there. They said there had been little recognition that reducing benefits like the Personal Independence Payment, which helps people keep their independence, had the potential to push up costs. Labour MP Diane Abbott said she would have liked to query the impact of the prime minister's proposed cuts to welfare but was told the meeting was full.  In a letter to Reeves, a dozen charities have argued there is \"little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes\". The charities - including Disability Rights UK, Citizens Advice, Scope and Sense - urged her to \"think again about cuts to disability benefits\". They said: \"There are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people, work isn't appropriate. \"Changes to welfare must start here. Not with cuts.\" But ministers are worried about the surge in the number of people claiming benefits since the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost to the taxpayer. As of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the pandemic. The Department of Work and Pensions says some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness. Last year, the government spent Â£65bn on sickness benefits and that figure is forecast to increase by tens of billions before the next general election. Some of the reforms to the welfare system have already been announced and include plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Share your experiences. Conservative shadow businesses secretary Andrew Griffith said Sir Keir had \"rightly\" talked about the problem of millions of working-age people on welfare. \"That is a stain on our country's character,\" Griffith told the BBC. \"But it also holds back the economy and it's one of the reasons why we're not growing.\" However, Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said \"slashing support without fixing broken public services is not the answer\". \"We need long-term reform and investment in health and social care, not short-term cuts that balance the nation's finances on the backs of the most vulnerable,\" he said.

        "content": "The man arrested by Humberside police is the captain of the Solong cargo ship, the vessel's owner tells the BBC Earlier, the police force said that a 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, following the North Sea collision Assistant Chief Coastguard John Craig says flames are still visible on the Solong, with salvage plans in place for both vessels One crew member of the Portuguese cargo ship is \"assumed deceased\", a UK minister says, as the transport secretary says both Solong and US oil tanker Stena Immaculate are expected to stay afloat Owners of the cargo ship say it was not carrying sodium cyanide, as previously reported, but had four empty containers that had once held the toxic chemical This video can not be played Watch: Charred container ship and oil tanker seen from above Edited by Matt Spivey Matt SpiveyLive page editor The captain of the Solong cargo ship, that collided with US oil tanker Stena Immaculate on Monday, has been arrested, the owner of the vessel told the BBC. It comes after Humberside Police said a 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter, in connection with the North Sea collision. One crew member of the Portuguese cargo ship is \"assumed deceased\", a UK minister says, after 13 of the 14 members of crew were rescued in the aftermath of the collision.  Assistant Chief Coastguard John Craig says salvage plans are in place for both vessels, but flames are still visible on the Solong. After an earlier expectation that the cargo ship could sink, both the Solong and Stena Immaculate are now expected to stay afloat, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says. Neither of the ships have been brought ashore, as plans for the possible repair of both vessels remains up in the air. In the coming days, there will be more clarity on what the future holds for both the Solong and Stena Immaculate. We're now closing our live coverage, thanks for joining us. Our colleagues on the news desk will continue to provide updates in our news story.  We're hearing now from Assistant Chief Coastguard John Craig, who says in a statement that there are still flames visible on the Solong cargo ship as salvage operations are being arranged for both vessels. Craig says the ships were \"interlocked and held in place by the anchor of the US oil tanker, Stena Immaculate, before the Solong detached and drifted south overnight\". A tug line is now in place in an effort to hold Solong in a safer position offshore, he says, adding that \"there are still some flames visible on the main deck of the Solong, and firefighting is focusing on this area\". \"A salvage plan is being developed,\" the statement adds. For the Stena Immaculate, which remains at anchor, a second salvage company has been engaged. The assistant chief coastguard says the fire on the vessel is \"greatly reduced with no flames visible\". Craig adds that a comprehensive counter pollution response is in place, as the \"threat from the previously identified Dangerous Goods on board has reduced significantly\". \"We continue to engage actively with Humberside Police, salvors, the port authorities and other agencies to protect the public and the environment as far as possible while continuing to respond to the developing situation,\" the statement concludes. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The owner of the Solong cargo ship, German firm Ernst Russ, has confirmed to the BBC that the man arrested by Humberside police is the master of the ship. They say that he, along with the rest of the crew, are assisting the investigation. In a statement they added that âOut of respect for the investigation and all involved we will not comment further at this time.â Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter I understand that all 23 crew on board the Stena Immaculate\nare Americans. They are all currently in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due\ncourse.  The owners of the ship, Florida-based Crowley, still have to\ndecide what will happen to the ship, whether it will be repaired and if so\nwhere. It is likely that, once it is safe, some form of crew will be needed on\nboard for safety reasons. The US military has confirmed that the ship was on a short-term charter to Military\nSealift Command on behalf of the US Defense Logistics Agency, Energy.  This is a\nbranch of the military responsible for making sure that the right equipment is\nin the right place. Sean DilleyBBC News Transport correspondent We can now bring you an update on the Solong - the cargo ship that struck an oil tanker in the North Sea off the coast of England on Monday.  Whitehall sources are now telling the BBC that there were Russians and Filipinos amongst the crew of the Portuguese cargo ship. We have yet to hear about the crew on board the Stena Immaculate, but the BBC spoke with an American sailor who was on the US-flagged tanker earlier today. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says she has been informed that both vessels are now expected to stay afloat, including the Solong.  Thie comes after minister for aviation, maritime and security Mike Kane told the Commons earlier, that it was \"highly unlikely\" the cargo ship would stay afloat. The transport secretary adds that Solong can be towed away from the shore and \"salvage operations can get under way\". Speaking about the potential environmental impact following the incident, Alexander says she will continue to monitor the situation and has has requested regular updates. Shipping movements in the Associated British Ports (ABP) of Hull, Immingham, Goole and Grimsby resumed on Monday evening after being halted in the morning, an ABP spokesperson tells the BBC.  Emma Lingard adds that ports remain restricted whilst the incident is ongoing, as ABP \"continues to support ongoing emergency operations\". Graham Stuart, MP for Beverley and Holderness, says a call with Mike Kane included \"broadly good news\" Graham Stuart, the MP for Beverley and Holderness in East Yorkshire, says there is no evidence, at this stage, that any of the heavy engine oil from either ship is leaking. Stuart spoke with minister for aviation, maritime and security Mike Kane, who addressed earlier speculations of sodium cyanide containers on the Portuguese cargo ship Solong. Referring to the earlier briefing from Kane, Stuart says containers on Solong were empty and \"there is no evidence of pollution in the water or in the air to date\". Testing kits are being sent out to confirm the purity of the water, as Stuart says the jet oil that leaked \"appears to have burned off\". He acknowledges that risks remain and it is possible that heavy engine oil could leak, if this is the case there are oil collection kits in Grimsby to mitigate the impact, Stuart adds. The Solong is still alight, as of the latest update from authorities The operation in the North Sea is still very much in the \"containment phase\", according to Peter Aylott, director of policy at UK Chamber of Shipping. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he says the main thing is getting the fire that remains on the Solong under control, and for now it remains too dangerous for workers to go aboard.  As we reported, the Solong appears to be attached to a tug boat with a line attached to the cargo ship.  However, Aylott says \"whether that line across at the moment is sufficient to be able to haul the vessel against the weather, against the tide\" depends on the situation.  It's more of a question of focusing on stopping the fire, to then get a secure line onto the ship, Aylott says. An assessment from an MP in the Commons earlier was that the Solong will likely sink. Aylott says if this does happen, it could be possible to re-float it, depending on the water depth. As we just reported, a 59-year-old man has been arrested in relation to the collision between two ships in the North Sea yesterday.  The Humberside Police says that a criminal investigation into the cause of the collision is now under way, and they are working in collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. âExtensive work has already been carried out, and we are working closely with our partners to understand what happened, and to provide support to all of those affected,\" Detective Chief Superintendent Craig Nicholson says in the statement. The 59-year-old man was arrested âfollowing enquiries undertaken by my team\" Nicholson says.  He is not identified, but the statement says he has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.  The arrest comes after the conclusion of search operations by HM Coastguard for the missing crew member of the Solong, it adds. âThe man arrested remains in custody at this time whilst enquiries are under way, and we continue speaking with all those involved to establish the full circumstances of the incident.â A 59-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with yesterday's collision in the North Sea, Humberside Police says.   It has opened a criminal investigation into the incident.  We'll bring you more details in a moment.   In the past hour, we've seen fresh images of the two vessels involved in a collision off the coast of East Yorkshire on Monday.  As we heard from Mike Kane in the Commons earlier, the fire on the Stena Immaculate has been extinguished while the fire on the Solong persists. In the live images of the vessels, which you can also see by pressing watch live at the top of this page, the Solong can be seen visibly charred, with a hole on its bow.  Containers are visible on board the Portuguese cargo vessel, as smoke continues to rise above it. Meanwhile, deluges of water can be seen gushing out of the Stena Immaculate. At the time of the collision on Monday morning, the Stena Immaculate was anchored. It was carrying jet fuel for the US military in multiple tanks.    Pictures this morning show extensive damage to the ship, which is no longer ablaze after burning through the night.  There is a large rupture on one side and water appears to be pouring out.    It seems that the Stena Immaculate may be able to stay afloat, due to design features like a dual hull and multiple tanks for carrying cargo. As for the other vessel involved in the collision, the Portuguese cargo ship Solong, MP Mike Kane says assessment reports suggest it is unlikely to stay afloat. Mike Ross, the Liberal Democrat leader of Hull City Council, has called for Cobra to be convened \"as soon as possible\". He adds that the collision between the Solong and Stena Immaculate vessels has the \"potential to be an environmental disaster\". âWe urgently need to see the scale of the area affected assessed and the level of pollution resulting from the crash,\" he says, adding that people across Hull and East Yorkshire need \"assurances that their local communities, coastline and wildlife will be safe\".  \"Thatâs why Iâm calling on Keir Starmer to convene Cobra today,\" says Ross. \"We will only get this assurance if the government acts quickly.\" Aerial images of the Stena Immaculate and Solong vessels, which collided in the North Sea on Monday, have emerged. You can track the movements of the vessels, and see images of them, by pressing watch live at the top of this page. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: We're continuing to track the movements of the Solong off the East Yorkshire coast, but we can now bring you an update from the prime minister's office. \"I understand there doesn't appear to be any suggestions of foul play at this time,\" the Downing Street spokesperson says about the collision of the two vessels in the North Sea on Monday. As we've been reporting, the incident set ablaze both the Portuguese Solong cargo ship and the US-flagged Stena Immaculate on Monday.  The fire on the Stena Immaculate appears to have since been extinguished, while the Solong continues to burn, according to the latest updates.  This video can not be played Aerial footage shows damage on cargo ship after collision We're continuing to track the movements of the Solong via live helicopter images, which you can watch at the top of this page. The pictures appear to show the Portuguese cargo ship being tugged by another vessel, with a line attaching them. There are two boats on either side of the Solong spraying water onto it. We're now getting the first images of the drifting cargo ship - which Mike Kane has just highlighted in the Commons began drifting southwards once it broke free from the Stena Immaculate overnight. Modelling suggests that if it remains afloat, the Solong will stay clear of land for the next few hours, the Labour MP adds. You can see these images by pressing watch live above. Mike Kane is now speaking in the Commons.  The minister for aviation, maritime and security begins by praising the rescue efforts and all those involved, thanking first responders for tackling the \"challenging\" and fast-moving situation. He recalls the order of events as he knows it, saying that at 09:47 GMT on Monday the Solong vessel collided with the US vessel on the North Sea. He says fire immediately broke out and crews abandoned ship. Kane says the fire on the Stena Immaculate vessel has been extinguished, but fire in the Solong persists. He adds that the assessment from experts is that it is unlikely that the Solong will remain afloat. He confirms that 13 of the 14 sailors on the Solong were rescued, and the working assumption is that the missing sailor is deceased. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "' largest' fusion fuel facility to be built",
        "content": "The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is based in Culham A facility designed to store and recover a fuel used for nuclear fusion is set to be built. United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and Italian energy company Eni have partnered to construct the facility - thought to be the world's largest - at the Culham science campus in Oxfordshire. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen which is heated and forced together to make a heavier particle during nuclear fusion. The new tritium fuel cycle facility, which will recover and re-use the particles, is due to be completed in 2028. Nuclear fusion is the energy process that powers the stars, with scientists saying it has the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The fusion process sees two hydrogen isotopes, such as tritium, fuse together under intense heat and pressure to form a helium atom - releasing large amounts of emissions-free energy. The new facility is due to be completed by 2028 UKAEA said tritium recovery and re-use would play a \"fundamental role\" in the \"supply and generation of the fuel in future fusion power plants\" and be \"crucial in making the technology increasingly efficient\". Kerry McCarthy, government climate minister, said the new facility would \"not only position the UK as a leader in the development of fusion fuel technologies\" but also \"accelerate progress towards a future of safe, sustainable, and abundant clean energy\". UKAEA added the site had been designed to \"serve as a world-class facility\", providing the opportunity to study how to process, store and recycle tritium. Prof Sir Ian Chapman, chief executive of UKAEA, said the agency believed that fusion energy could \"contribute to a net zero future, including going beyond the decarbonisation of electricity\". He said the new plant would \"set a benchmark which would be paving the way for innovative offerings in fusion fuel\". Culham was previously home to a nuclear fusion reactor, which in its final test produced a record amount of energy. The reactor was decommissioned in 2024, with the government hoping to build the world's first fusion power plant in Nottinghamshire â which would begin operation in the 2040s.

        "title": "Mark Carney: The 'anti-Trump' numbers man who may force the UK to take a side",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Key moments on Mark Carney's journey from banker to Canada's PM Mark Carney's elevation to the top job in Canada is of particular significance at this moment when his country is at the frontline of a North American trade war. He becomes the \"anti-Trump\" on the US president's doorstep. The former Bank of England governor chose to lean strongly into resisting Donald Trump's policies at his acceptance speech. He said the US president had brought \"dark days\" from \"a country we can no longer trust\" and that he was \"proud\" of Canadians resisting the US \"with their wallets\". While on trade specifically Mr Carney vowed to keep the retaliatory tariffs \"until Americans show us respect\", it was clear that the general threats against Canadian sovereignty are equally as important in his thinking.  Trump has repeatedly said he will use economic power to encourage Canada to become the 51st state of the US, but Carney hit back. \"The Americans want our resources, our land, our water, our countryâ¦ Canada will never be part of America in any way, shape or form,\" he said. Behind the scenes, Carney has been encouraging a very robust response to Mr Trump. As he told me last month in his only UK interview during his campaign to succeed current Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it was necessary to \"stand up to a bully\".  He ridiculed Trump's allegations of Canada's involvement in fentanyl trade, and the US president's suggestion that Canada has ripped off the US. Canada's trade deficit is caused \"entirely\" by its exports of subsidised oil, Carney told me, and \"perhaps we should ask for that subsidy back\". Canada's next PM Mark Carney vows to win trade war with Trump Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations? How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister He follows in the footsteps of former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi as a former top central banker who became a G7 leader. It is an otherwise rare path, but it may be good timing when Canada's nearest neighbour has suggested using economic power to take over. Carney has experience in this area having dealt with a number of acute political-economic crises, such as the banking crash, the eurozone crisis, sterling's sharp slide after Brexit, and the start of the pandemic.  He has also regularly attended G20 meetings at leader level, including in the presence of Trump, as chair of the Financial Stability Board, an international economic body. At one such meeting, the Trump team threatened to leave the International Monetary Fund.  Carney believes that Trump only respects power. Of any attempt to mollify Trump, he said \"good luck with that\". He will focus further tariff retaliation on bringing inflation and interest rate rises to Canada's \"southern neighbour\". This video can not be played Watch: 'Canada will never, ever be part of America' - Mark Carney The Canadian election is due by October, but Carney might call an earlier one. Depending on that, he is on course to host Trump in Canada at the G7 Summit in June. His rise to the top job raises the stakes for the UK. On the one hand, a more robust approach from an allied G7 leader stands in contrast to the UK's attempt to hug the White House closely.   On the other hand, Carney also hinted at wanting to diversify trade towards \"more reliable\" partners, which would include the UK and EU. Canada might send its subsidised energy to Europe, rather than the US. The bigger strategic point is that Carney's background means a focus on international solidarity, and defence of the existing multilateral system. He says Canada can \"stand on its own feet\" but sees merit in creating a more coherent international alliance to focus the minds of Congress and tariff-sceptics in the Trump administration. Canada's new leadership expects support from its Commonwealth ally, the UK. After my recent interview with him, Carney turned the camera to the portrait on the wall of the office from which he was talking to me: King Charles. The message was clear. Canada and the UK should be on the same side in this new world era.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Migrant emerges from back of motorhome A couple who discovered a migrant had clung to the back of their vehicle all the way home from France have been issued a Â£1,500 fine. Adrian and Joanne Fenton said they called police when they found the person zipped inside the cover of a bike rack at their home in Heybridge, Essex, in October. They later received a fine from the Home Office for failing to \"check that no clandestine entrant was concealed\" in the motorhome. The pair said they were drafting an appeal. The Home Office said penalties were \"designed to target negligence rather than criminality\". Border Force officials were called to Adrian and Joanne Fenton's home in Essex after they found the man hidden in their bike rack The man was discovered inside the cover of a bike rack, attached to the couple's motorhome \"At no point did I believe I would be fined by taking correct and moral action,\" said Mr Fenton, writing in an email exchange to the Home Office, seen by the BBC. \"This action taken by Border Force to impose a fine only encourages travellers [or] holidaymakers in this position not to call the police but to let the stowaway abscond.\" Joanne Fenton said she and her husband were drafting an appeal after their Â£1,500 Home Office fine Speaking to the JVS Show on BBC Three Counties Radio, Mrs Fenton said the pair had been travelling in France with friends and returned to the UK via ferry on 15 October. The 55-year-old said border officials in Calais and the UK had not inspected the bike rack or the cover before or after the crossing. Retired firefighter Mr Fenton, 57, had been at the wheel for the six-hour journey before the pair arrived home at 22:15 BST. Mrs Fenton said her husband unzipped the \"really tight\" cover they had been using for their bicycles on the back of the motorhome. \"He sees two trainers... goes to have a look, and there's two legs attached to it,\" she recalled. \"He's gone 'Jo, you need to phone the police. We've got a stowaway.'\" Mrs Fenton said she offered the young man a bottle of water, to which he said \"thank you\". She said he told police he was from Sudan, and that he was 16 years old. Adrian Fenton said the migrant was latched on to the bike rack, under the covers, for a six-hour journey from France to Essex The Essex couple were travelling in Australia over Christmas when they received an email from the Home Office with details of the offence and fine. It said they failed to \"check that no clandestine entrant was concealed in the vehicle\", but Mrs Fenton contested that technically he was clinging to the outside rather than aboard the motorhome. Holiday couple fined after finding migrant in motorhome The email also said the \"entrant\" was found by an authorised search officer, despite the couple saying they called the police the night they found him. The fine referenced asylum and immigration legislation.

        "title": "Trump says US economy in 'transition' as trade war escalates",
        "content": "A sell-off in the US stock market gathered steam on Monday, fuelled by rising concern about the cost of the trade war to the world's largest economy. The S&P 500, which tracks the biggest American companies, fell about 2% in early trade, while the Dow Jones dropped 0.9% and the Nasdaq sank more than 3.5%. The falls came after President Donald Trump ducked questions about whether the US economy was facing a recession or price rises as a result of tariff moves, while warning instead of a \"period of transition\". Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the US, although he acknowledged that the price of some goods may rise. Investors fear that tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world's largest economy. \"The level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,\" Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme. Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors had been optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war.  He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets.  \"It's a complete change in what the market expected,\" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending amid the uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth.  European stocks closed lower on Monday, with France's CAC and the London FTSE indices both closing around 0.9% lower. Germany's DAX closed 1.75% lower. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was because of \"unease around the impact of Trump tariffs\". She added that concerns over the US economy entering a recession is worrying investors.  Tesla shares fell about 8% on Monday, while tech stocks Nvidia and Meta were both down more than 4%. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the concerns, responding to a question about whether the US was facing recession: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.\" \"It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,\" he added. This video can not be played Watch: Trump says tariff exemptions not influenced by the markets The US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. He imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada last week, but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%.  The US is now facing retaliation, including new tit-for-tat tariffs from China targeting US farm products that came into effect on Monday.  They mean US exports including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans face new tariffs of 10% to 15%. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who leads Canada's most populous province, also said he was going forward with a 25% surcharge on energy exports to the US, announced in retaliation for the tariffs.  If Trump escalates, \"I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,\" he warned.  Trump expands exemptions from Canada and Mexico tariffs Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk Trump team hits pause on tariffs - but still sees them as vital tool Speaking on NBC on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged: \"Foreign goods may get a little more expensive\".  \"But American goods are going to get cheaper,\" he said. But when asked whether the US economy could face a recession he added: \"Absolutely notâ¦ There's going to be no recession in America.\" Former US Commerce Department official, Frank Lavin, told the BBC that he thinks the trade war is unlikely to escalate out of control. But while tariffs will eventually \"fade a bit\" they will still be an \"extra burden on the US economy,\" he said. Han Shen Lin, China country director at consultancy firm The Asia Group, told the BBC's Today programme: \"You're seeing a lot of tit for tat between both sides to demonstrate that neither side will back off easily. \"That said China has realised it probably can't export its way to GDP growth in the way that it used to so it is focusing a lot more on the domestic economy right now.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Lab-grown food could be sold in UK in two years",
        "content": "This lab-grown Wagyu steak is ready to eat, but can't be sold in the UK because it has not yet been approved  Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected.  The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods. Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants. UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations. Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month. In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year. However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans. The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.  It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting. But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest. The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time. Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety. \"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said. But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach. \"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said. The cells are grown in fermentation tanks and then processed to look like food The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".  \"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News. \"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\" Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier. The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.  The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures. Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows. The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait. \"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\" These lab-grown crystals look like sugar and are much sweeter Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.  It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks. In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval. \"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.  \"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\" The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.  Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right. \"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\" But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold. \"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said. \"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "title": "North Korean hackers cash out hundreds of millions from $1.5bn ByBit hack",
        "content": "Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully converted at least $300m (Â£232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist to unrecoverable funds. The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBit two weeks ago. Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash. Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development.  \"Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,\" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic. Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says. \"I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash.\" Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now \"gone dark\", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered.  The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development. On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to. ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers. ByBit CEO Ben Zhou is hoping to reclaim some of the stolen funds through a bounty project Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been  taken. The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, \"waging war on Lazarus\". ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible. All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group. If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime. So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers. But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money. \"North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,\" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said. More on the Lazarus Group Hackers, North Korea and billions of dollars Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others. Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out. More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange. But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that. He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack. He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency. Park Jin Hyok is one of the alleged Lazarus Group hackers North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain. Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies.  The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds. Recent hacks linked to North Korea include: The 2019 hack on UpBit for $41m The $275m theft of crypto from exchange KuCoin (most of the funds were recovered) The 2022 Ronin Bridge attack which saw hackers make off with $600m in crypto Approximately $100m in crypto was stolen in an attack on Atomic Wallet in 2023 In 2020, the US added North Koreans accused of being part of the Lazarus Group to its Cyber Most Wanted list. But the chances of the individuals ever being arrested are extremely slim unless they leave their country.

        "title": "Thames Water set for crucial court ruling",
        "content": "The fate of debt-laden Thames Water could become clearer later this week. The Court of Appeal is expected to decide whether the company's plan to borrow a further Â£3bn to avoid collapse can proceed or whether it upholds objections from a small group of creditors and Liberal Democrat MP Charlie Maynard. If it approves the plan, Thames Water lives on long enough to attempt a restructuring of debts and garnering of new investment. If it approves the appeal, Thames could fall into a government-backed administration within weeks or days. Either outcome is guaranteed to generate strong reaction. Customer bills and supply are unlikely to be affected - either way, bills are due to go up. The company â and the vast majority of lenders - insists that a government rescue will end up costing taxpayers billions, set back the timetable to fix this broken business and send both suppliers and would-be investors running for the hills. Others, including Mr Maynard and academics like Professor Sir Dieter Helm, argue that the Thames plan mainly serves the narrow interests of its current lenders who stand to lose more of their money in an administration than they would if they can keep the show on the road â particularly since the extra money they want to lend them comes with a very hefty interest rate. The public interest is best served, they say, by using the same mechanism employed when energy company Bulb went bust.  In that case, the cost was initially estimated by the Treasury to be Â£6bn but ended up costing close to zero as energy prices moved in the government's favour. The answer depends largely â but not entirely â on how much one estimates a government rescue would cost taxpayers. Thames itself has presented an estimate of up to Â£4bn. While Charlie Maynard has presented a figure of Â£66m. Others have said it wouldn't cost taxpayers a dime in the long run. A staggering range. Ofwat, the regulator, seems to have sided with the company. In submissions to the courts, Ofwat presented the Â£4bn figure and Mr Maynard's Â£66m and chose only to comment that Mr Maynard's figure was the least evidenced. The Secretary of State Steve Reed has said that government involvement \"would cost billions and take years\". Eminent economist and infrastructure expert Professor Sir Dieter Helm argues that it could end up costing the government zero as the proceeds of a sale back to the private sector would eventually cover the costs incurred in the short to medium term by the government. A person close to the situation said \"the idea that SAR is cost-free is fanciful and dangerous. It's time for the reality to be recognised. SAR is not a good outcome.\" Most importantly, the BBC understands that a figure in the billions may be included in the OBR's official forecast under the \"risks to the outlook\" section. Watch on iPlayer - Thames Water: Inside the Crisis The correct answer is that no one can be quite sure. What is uncontested is that in a so called Special Administration Regime (SAR), the financial and operational risks of the company transfer from the private to the public sector. In the short to medium term, the taxpayer will bear financial risks that are substantial. Thames has a plan to invest nearly Â£20bn over the next five years while it only has revenue of Â£2.3bn a year.  The extra money comes from upfront borrowing that the company pays back through customer bills over many years. In a SAR, that upfront cost would be borne by the taxpayer. Longer term, when the company is sold back to the private sector, that money could be recouped â plus interest - from the sale proceeds. It's very hard to estimate what Thames would sell for. Well-performing water companies sell for around 50% of the value of their assets. Thames assets are worth around Â£18bn on paper â which would give a figure of Â£9bn.  Given the age of those assets, the high operational costs of working around high population density and its miserable track record, it's very unlikely that Thames would sell for anywhere near that. Whenever the government rescues something with the intention of selling back to the private sector â it is always possible, likely even, they may get less money back than they put in. There are many examples of this - including British Steel and the RBS. As far as the government is concerned, rescuing Thames comes with a cost that would affect the public finances negatively over the course of this parliament.  Given the well-publicised but self-imposed constraints on the Chancellor, it's not hard to see why the government would like to avoid it if possible. The other argument advanced by Mr Maynard in his appeal against the Â£3bn private lifeline â is that it will well end up being paid for by customers. Ofwat again decided to intervene on this, writing to the court that the company would be barred from recouping financing costs from customers. Thames itself argues there are other reasons a SAR would not be in the public interest. New administrators parachuted in to caretake a vast sprawling business would be ill-equipped to take on the task of turning around a company whose new management insists had formulated a clear plan.  Thames would be a company in limbo with little momentum to get on with the mammoth task. People close to that plan fear suppliers could also be wary of extended payment terms under government-backed supervision. Those arguments may be nonsense. Attempts to prolong the life in its current form of a company laid low by years of under-investment, overgenerous pay and dividends, poor regulation and changing climate may be doomed. But what many, including government officials and ministers, ask themselves is â what is there to lose by letting the company have a go at restructuring and potentially redeeming itself over the next few years? If it fails, it fails and Special Administration is a mechanism that's been built into the system since privatisation and will still be there in six months, a year â by which time we will know whether they can do it or not.

        "content": "The Vatican had not released any photos of the pope since he was admitted to hospital The Vatican has released the first image of Pope Francis since he was admitted to hospital a month ago. The photo shows the pontiff sitting in a wheelchair in front of an altar at a chapel in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he has been recovering from pneumonia. Earlier on Sunday, in his written Angelus message, the Pope said he faced a \"period of trial\" as he thanked well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed for peace in \"countries wounded by war\".  It marked the fifth Sunday in a row that the Pope was not present in person for his weekly blessing. The Vatican said earlier this week that an X-ray had confirmed \"improvements\" in his condition, but that he still needed hospital treatment. \"The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy,\" it said in a statement on Saturday, adding that they were \"showing further, gradual improvements\". Pope Francis, 88, has not been seen in public since his admission to hospital on 14 February - and until Sunday, no photographs had been released. \"I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me,\" the Pope said in his latest statement, released earlier in the day.  \"Let us continue to pray for peace, especially in the countries wounded by war: tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"  Since his arrival in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, the Pope has been treated for double pneumonia and other infections.  He has also suffered several respiratory crises, which has raised concerns about his survival.  Earlier on this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.  His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers. This video can not be played Listen: Pope Francis shares voice message from hospital Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is the first Pope from the Americas. He contracted pleurisy as a young man and had a partial lung removal, which has left him particularly vulnerable to pneumonia.  As a result of his long road to recovery, there has been speculation that Pope Francis could choose to follow his predecessor Benedict XVI in resigning the papacy.  But friends and biographers close to the Pope have insisted that he has no plans to step down. And, despite his fragile health, the pontiff has continued his work from hospital. This year is a Catholic Holy Year, with 32 million pilgrims expected to travel to Rome.

        "title": "South Africa ambassador: US should not bully us, say opposition parties",
        "content": "Rasool was an ambassador to the US twice  Opposition parties in South Africa have called on its president not to be \"bullied\" by the US after Washington expelled Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool, giving him just 72 hours to leave the country. Rasool was declared an unwelcome person after US State Secretary Marco Rubio called him a \"race-baiting politician who hates America\" on Friday.  Tensions between South African and the US have been on a downward spiral since US President Donald Trump came into office. However, South Africa's Minister of International Relations Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC that \"it is not helpful to engage in Twitter diplomacy\", saying the two countries need to talk \"face-to-face\". Other politicians were less measured in their response. Julius Malema's opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party issued a scathing statement against the US, calling on South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa \"to not allow the country to be bullied by the orange clown occupying the White House\".  Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) Secretary General Apa Pooe also condemned the US decision, calling it an attack on South Africa's sovereignty and an attempt to dictate policy in the country.  \"SA is not a puppet of the US, we have the right to govern our country without any interference,\" he said. Trump has been a vocal critic of South Africa's controversial land law, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances. Last month, Trump cut aid to South Africa. He alleged there was discrimination against the white Afrikaner minority, descendants of Dutch and French settlers. South Africa denies this.  Rasool previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015, when Barack Obama was president.  He was appointed as ambassador again in 2024, because of his previous experience and extensive network of Washington contacts.  But despite his record, he has faced challenges setting up meetings with Trump. One unnamed South African diplomat told news site Semafor that someone with the ambassador's \"history of pro-Palestine politics\", among other things, \"is not likely to do well in that job right now\". The Democratic Alliance (DA) - a coalition partner in South Africa's government of national unity (GNU) - has questioned why the largest party, the African National Congress (ANC), was still choosing all its foreign diplomats. \"It is simply just not right that the ANC has got carte blanche on foreign policy and the appointments of diplomats while they are only a 39% party,\"  DA spokesperson Willie Aucamp told SABC, as he called for members of the GNU to be allowed to go to Washington to ease tensions.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Fisherman reunites with brother after 95 days lost at sea A Peruvian fisherman who survived 95 days lost at sea in the Pacific Ocean by eating turtles, birds and cockroaches has been rescued and reunited with his family. Maximo Napa Castro, 61, set off for what should have been a two-week fishing trip from the coastal town of Marcona, on the southern Peruvian coast, on 7 December.  Ten days in, a storm blew his boat off course, leaving him adrift with dwindling supplies. His family launched a search, but Peru's maritime patrols were unable to locate him.  It was not until Wednesday that the Ecuadorian patrol vessel Don F found him 1,094km (680 miles) from the coast, dehydrated and in a critical condition. Maximo survived by catching rainwater in his boat and eating whatever he could find.  In an emotional reunion with his brother in Paita, near the Ecuadorian border, on Friday, he described how he had eaten cockroaches and birds before resorting to sea turtles. His last 15 days were spent without food. Thinking of his family, including his two-month-old granddaughter, gave him the strength to endure, Mr Castro said.  \"I thought about my mother everyday. I'm thankful to God for giving me a second chance.\" His mother, Elena, told local media that, while her relatives remained optimistic during her son's disappearance, she had begun to lose hope. After his rescue, Mr Castro was taken to Paita for medical assessment before being flown to the Peruvian capital, Lima.  There, at Jorge ChÃ¡vez International Airport, he was met by his daughter, InÃ©s Napa, in an emotional reunion surrounded by a media scrum. She welcomed him home with a bottle of pisco, Peru's national drink. In his home district of San AndrÃ©s in the Ica region, neighbours and relatives told Peruvian media agency RPP they decorated the streets in celebration.  His niece, Leyla Torres Napa, said the family planned to celebrate his birthday, which passed while he was lost at sea. She told the agency: \"The day of his birth was unique because all that he could eat [while at sea] was a small cookie, so it is very important for us that we celebrate because, for us, he has been reborn.\" Last year, Russian Mikhail Pichugin was rescued after spending more than two months adrift in a small inflatable boat in the Sea of Okhotsk, to the east of Russia. Similarly, JosÃ© Salvador Alvarenga, a Salvadoran fisherman, endured an extraordinary 14-month ordeal adrift in the Pacific Ocean.  Setting out from Mexico's coast in late 2012, he was eventually found in the Marshall Islands in early 2014, and also survived on rainwater and turtles.

The Community Connectors Project held a launch event at Northampton's Grosvenor Centre on Friday to help individuals connect with mental health support.  The project, led by Northamptonshire Mind, seeks to foster stronger community ties and provide culturally competent care. \"A lot of the time in our culture, mental health is stigmatised; we think we're exempt from it when we're not,\" said Leandra Litchmore, one of Northamptonshire Mind's volunteers. \"Despite your race, we all experience mental health issues... and eventually they will be more comfortable and confident to talk about [their mental health issues] because they will realise it is normal.\"  The 21-year-old is one of the charity's designated community connectors in Northampton, and she said Mind had been \"very supportive\" with her own mental health issues. Stacey Bryan, from Northamptonshire Mind, says the number of people accessing mental health services from diverse communities in Northamptonshire is not representative Research by Mind found that 47% of people from diverse backgrounds, external worry they will not find appropriate mental health support, while more than a third have experienced stigma or discrimination from healthcare professionals. The initiative will also train Mental Health Ambassadors; volunteers who will receive training in awareness, safeguarding, and active listening to support others in their communities. Stacey Bryan, a another community connector for Northamptonshire Mind, said: \"I think this project will make a huge difference. \"I've already had a massively positive response, and shouting loudly about [mental health]... in itself is helpful.\" The project is funded by the National Lottery until October 2027.

        "title": "US deports hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite court order",
        "content": "This video can not be played Video shows alleged gang members deported by US in El Salvador mega-jail More than 200 Venezuelans alleged by the White House to be gang members have been deported from the US to a supermax prison in El Salvador, even as a US judge blocked the removals. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media that 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had arrived in the Central American country, along with 23 members of the international MS-13 gang, on Sunday morning. Neither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, nor provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership. A federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify some of the deportations, but the flights had already departed. \"Oopsie... Too late,\" posted Bukele on social media, referring to the judge's ruling.  A video attached to one of his posts shows lines of people with their hands and feet shackled being escorted by armed officials from the planes. What is Tren de Aragua? White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the court ruling had been violated.  \"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,\" she said.  \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.\" This video can not be played Watch: Attorney says 'no question' that US deportations violate law US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he had signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as he accused Tren de Aragua of \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\". He said members of the gang would be deported for engaging in \"irregular warfare\" against the US.  The act - which was last used during World War Two to intern Japanese-American civilians - is a broad law that allows the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an \"enemy\" nation without the usual processes. What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants? On Saturday evening, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington DC ordered a 14-day halt to deportations covered by Trump's proclamation, pending further legal arguments. After lawyers told him that planes with deportees had already taken off, Judge Boasberg gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back, US media reported, although that directive did not form part of his written ruling. The alleged criminals were transported to El Salvador's mega-jail The written notice appeared in the case docket at 19:25 EDT on Saturday (00:25 GMT on Sunday), the Reuters news agency reports, although it is unclear when the flights carrying the alleged gang members departed from the US. In a court filing on Sunday, Department of Justice lawyers said the order had not applied because the deportees \"had already been removed from United States territory\". A senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that 261 people were deported on Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties. The justice department has appealed against the judge's ruling.  The American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in the lawsuit against the Trump administration, said the court's order may have been violated. The case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling. Venezuela criticised Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\". Rights groups condemned Trump, accusing him of using a 227-year-old law to circumvent due process.   Amnesty International USA wrote on X that the deportations were \"yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting\" of Venezuelans \"based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation\". President Bukele, a Trump ally, wrote that the detainees were immediately transferred to El Salvador's notorious mega-jail, the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot). The El Salvadoran president said they would be held there \"for a period of one year\", and that could be \"renewable\". El Salvador's Cecot jail is part of Bukele's effort to crack down on the country's organised crime.  The newly built maximum-security facility, which can hold up to 40,000 people, has been accused by human rights groups of mistreating inmates. Cecot, which can hold up to 40,000 people, has been criticised by human rights groups The arrangement between the US and El Salvador is a sign of strengthening diplomatic ties.  El Salvador was the second country that Rubio visited as the US's top diplomat. During that trip, which took place in February, Bukele made an initial offer to take US deportees, saying it would help pay for the massive Cecot facility.  The latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration in the US.   In January, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua and MS-13 foreign terrorist organisations. He won over voters on the campaign trail, in part, by promising to enact the largest deportation operation in US history.  While illegal border crossings have plummeted to the lowest number in decades since Trump took office, the Republican president has reportedly been frustrated by the relatively slow pace of deportations so far.

        "title": "Mental health conditions are overdiagnosed, Streeting says",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Streeting says 'wait for plans' amid PIP cuts row There is an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\", Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said. Streeting told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the welfare system had to be \"sustainable\", as he defended the government's forthcoming  reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill. Mental health charity Mind has since warned it was important to be \"extremely careful\" with the language around diagnoses to avoid stigmatising people. More than half of the rise in working-age disability claims since the Covid pandemic is related to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, external. The eligibility of people to apply for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - the main benefit for working-age adults - looks likely to be tightened under the plans. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out details of reforms to welfare on Tuesday. When asked if he agreed with experts that warn of an overdiagnosis of mental health conditions, Streeting said he wanted to \"follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis\". He told the BBC: \"Here's the other thing, mental wellbeing, illness, it's a spectrum and I think definitely there's an overdiagnosis but there's too many people being written off.\" The health secretary said there were \"too many people who just aren't getting the support they need\" and highlighted the government's pledge to recruit 8,500 more mental health staff to cut waiting lists. Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and campaigns for Mind, said Streeting was right to say not enough people were getting the right help, but warned against stigmatising those with mental health problems. He said: \"Applying for benefits is not an easy process. People with a mental health problem must go through a lengthy and arduous assessment process, with decisions to not award support often overturned at appeal stage\". Mr Patel acknowledged more must be done to equip people to look after their mental health, but added \"we must remember we have experienced a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and cost-of-living crisis.  \"We have deep problems of poverty, low-paid and insecure work and systemic racism in this country,\" he added, saying mental health services are at \"breaking point\". Also responding to Streeting's comments, Brian Dow, deputy chief executive of charity Rethink Mental Illness, said pressures in the system created a \"tremendous struggle\" for people with long-term illnesses to get diagnosed. \"The crisis in the nation's mental health is very real,\" Mr Dow said. Does cutting benefits actually work? The previous Conservative government had explored, external making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP. Streeting would not be drawn on the details of the government's welfare reforms. The BBC understands ministers are considering abandoning plans to not increase PIPs in line with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - for a year. The potential shift in position comes after a number of usually loyal Labour MPs voiced strong opposition to freezing PIP. When asked if PIPs would be frozen, Streeting said: \"I haven't seen the full plans, they haven't come to Cabinet yet. \"But what I do know is the Work and Pensions Secretary wants to support people who need help the most.\" He added: \"I haven't seen the proposals but you've seen the briefing, you've seen the speculation. I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.\" Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform. When asked if the Conservatives would back the welfare changes, she said her party supported the \"principle of welfare reform\" but \"we're not clear on the plan\". The SNP has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the \"cuts to disabled people\". The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the Labour government had \"boxed itself in with its Tory austerity rules\" on public spending. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billions of pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. On Friday, she said ministers needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, as she attempts to meet the government's self-imposed rules on public spending. Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from Â£64.7bn in 2023-24 to Â£100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. PIP is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending on this projected to almost double to Â£34bn by 2029-30. PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work. Part of the reforms set out by Kendall will include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.

        "content": "The units are designed to bring inpatient facilities for mental health patients up to modern standards Two new, purpose built, mental health facilities in Derbyshire are set to open later this month. The 54 bed units at Derby and Chesterfield are part of a Â£150m investment by the NHS designed to improve privacy, dignity and safety for patients. As well as ending dormitory-style accommodation, patients will be given more control over their surroundings, like heating, lighting and entertainment, in a move aimed at reducing anxiety and confrontation. Each unit will also have a shared therapy suite and kitchen, indoor fitness room, online library resource room, arts room and access to a secured roof terrace. The new units give patients more space of their own, aiding recovery, officials said The Carsington and Derwent units, in Derby and Chesterfield, are part of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's Â£150m Making Room for Dignity programme. This is designed to replace outdated facilities and bring the area's six main mental health hubs up to national standards.  Additionally Derbyshire will have its first psychiatric intensive care unit  (PICU) which should largely avoid patients being sent hundreds of miles away for specialist NHS care. Officials said giving people their own room was \"incredibly important\" as dormitories meant sharing a bay with strangers which often leads to anxiety and stress. Rosie, a former patient training to be a nurse, said the new units would benefit many people Rosie, 24 , a former mental health patient who is currently training to be a mental health nurse at the University of Derby, is impressed with the new facilities. She said: \"They are going to benefit future patients a lot because staff are going to be able to support them in a better way at a vulnerable time.  \"A lot of people suffer with sensory issues and can quickly feel overwhelmed but this is a more calming environment.\" The trust said the new units would help them meet growing demand The trust's chief executive officer, Mark Powell, said: \"Having these new facilities will aid recovery and keep people in hospital for a shorter amounts of time is a real game changer for us in Derbyshire.  \"Yes, demand is growing but our teams are doing a fantastic job of managing that demand both at inpatient settings and in the community.\" Other parts of the project involve Bluebell Ward at Walton Hospital in Chesterfield for older adults with acute mental health needs, which opened on 7 January 2025, the Radbourne Unit, at the Royal Derby Hospital which will be refurbished creating  single rooms, and Audrey House, an enhanced care unit for female patients at Kingsway in Derby.

The couple said the stowaway was found under a bicycle rack cover Mr Fenton, 57, had boarded Le Shuttle from Calais to Folkestone in Kent on the evening of 15 October, after they had been travelling around France. Mrs Fenton, 55, told the JVS show on BBC Three Counties Radio that, after a six-hour drive back to their home, her husband had unzipped the cover of the bicycle rack and found the migrant inside. Mrs Fenton said the migrant told police he was 16 and from Sudan The couple said they called the police to tell them they had found the stowaway. Mrs Fenton said the boy later informed the police he was 16 years old and from Sudan. They then received an email saying they were being fined. The couple argued he had been clinging to the outside of the motorhome, rather than inside it, and that they did the right thing by calling police. Joanne Fenton said they would still be travelling abroad, but would not put a cover on their bike rack The pair have now received an email from Border Force, which is part of the Home Office, reducing the fine to Â£0. Mr Fenton added: \"We don't want anyone else to go through what we've gone through. \"If someone does call the police because they've got someone discovered in their motorhome, Border Force shouldn't even be considering fining them because everyone's doing the moral and the right thing.\" He said the Home Office should \"be looking at their policy and make sure that it's fit for purpose and not targeting holidaymakers\". Mrs Fenton said the couple would still take their motorhome abroad but would be \"ultra careful - there'll be no covers over the bike rack\". Do you have a story suggestion for Essex?

        "title": "Trump dismantles Voice of America with executive order",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Dismantling Voice of America is 'serious business', says Tammy Bruce US President Donald Trump has signed an order to strip back federally funded news organisation Voice of America, accusing it of being \"anti-Trump\" and \"radical\". A White House statement said the order would \"ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\", and included quotes from politicians and right-wing media criticising the broadcaster. VOA, still primarily a radio service, was set up during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda. It says it currently reaches hundreds of millions of people globally each week. Mike Abramowitz, VOA's director, said he and virtually his entire staff of 1,300 people had been put on paid leave. Abramowitz said that the order left VOA unable to carry out its \"vital mission... especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\". The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\". It added: \"If an entire newsroom can be sidelined overnight, what does that say about the state of press freedom?  \"An entire institution is being dismantled piece by piece. This isn't just a staffing decision - it's a fundamental shift that endangers the future of independent journalism at VOA.\" The president's order targets VOA's parent company US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also funds non-profit entities such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, which were originally set up to counter communism. It tells managers to \"reduce performanceâ¦ to the minimum presence and function required by law\". CBS, the BBC's US news partner, said that VOA employees were notified in an email by Crystal Thomas, the USAGM human resources director. A source told CBS that all freelance workers and international contractors were told there was now no money to pay them. Emails obtained by CBS notified the bosses of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that their federal grants had been terminated. VOA and other stations under USAGM say they serve more than 400 million listeners. They are broadly equivalent to the BBC World Service, which is part-funded by the British government. The Czech Republic's Foreign Minister, Jan LipavskÃ½, said he hoped the European Union could help keep Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty running in Prague.   He said he would ask European foreign ministers at a meeting on Monday to find ways to at least partially maintain the broadcaster's operations. Elon Musk, the billionaire and top adviser to Trump who has been overseeing sweeping cuts to the US government, has used his social media platform X to call for VOA to be shut down. The US president also cut funding to several other federal agencies - including those responsible for preventing homelessness, and funding museums and libraries. Trump was highly critical of VOA in his first term. He has recently appointed staunch loyalist Kari Lake to be a special adviser for the USAGM. The president regularly states that mainstream media outlets are biased against him. He called CNN and MSNBC \"corrupt\" during a speech at the justice department. Voice of America launched in 1942 with a mandate to combat Nazi and Japanese propaganda Voice of America launched in 1942 with a mandate to combat Nazi and Japanese propaganda. Its first broadcast - made on a transmitter loaned to the US by the BBC - stated a modest purpose. Gerald Ford, a former president, signed VOA's public charter in 1976 to safeguard its editorial independence. By 1994, the Broadcast Board of Governors, with oversight over non-military broadcasting, was established. In 2013, a shift in legislation allowed VOA and affiliates to begin broadcasting in the US.

        "title": "Wes Streeting admits 'risk of disruption' in NHS overhaul",
        "content": "This video can not be played Streeting: Significant job losses as part of NHS reforms Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said there is a \"risk of disruption\" in the NHS as he attempts to overhaul the service and reduce waste, but has promised long-term improvements. On Thursday, Streeting announced NHS England, a public administrative body, would be scrapped to save money and give ministers more control of health services. The Labour government expects the move will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline NHS services. Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Streeting defended the reforms but admitted there would be challenges. When asked about the impact on patient care, he said: \"Of course there are always up-front costs. And yes there is always a risk of disruption.\" Streeting said former health secretaries had \"not been prepared to take on those sorts of challenges\" and argued NHS England \"was set up to shield politicians like me from responsibility\". He said: \"I've seen waste, inefficiency and duplication. So of course we should go after that.\" When asked for a second time if patient care would be disrupted by the government's reorganisation of the NHS, Streeting promised to deliver improvements and said waiting lists for treatment had already been falling. NHS England chair warns the buck now stops with ministers 'Crack teams' helping cut NHS waits - Streeting What does NHS England do? Your questions answered on health reforms The government said its main reasons for abolishing NHS England were to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how health services operate. It dubbed NHS England \"the world's largest quango\" - the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. Currently, NHS England oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services. Under the changes, the organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which is headed by Streeting. The reforms will not impact anyone's access to the NHS, with the health service remaining free at the point of use. The government said it expected around half of the jobs at NHS England and DHSC to go - around 9,000 administrative roles. The chairman of NHS England, Richard Meddings, said he did not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation, in his first interview since the changes were announced. But speaking to the BBC, he said the buck will now stop with ministers, saying: \"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong.\" Writing in the Telegraph, external, Streeting suggested scrapping NHS England was \"the beginning, not the end\" and said he would continue \"slashing bloated bureaucracy\". The health secretary tasked Penny Dash, who was made chairman of NHS England at the start of this month, with carrying out a review of bureaucracy. Some of the organisations overseen by the Department for Health include Care Quality Commission, the UK Health Security Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Beneath those is a patchwork of smaller public bodies on a regional and local level. Speaking to the BBC, Streeting would not be drawn on which bureaucratic NHS organisations he would consider axing, but suggested there was \"an overregulation\" of NHS services. He said NHS frontline leaders have told him \"they are often receiving a barrage of commands - sometimes contradictory and competing demands - from the Department for Health, from NHS England and from the wide range of regulators in this space\". He said simplification would set the NHS up to succeed and he was \"going after the bureaucracy, not the people who work in it\". He added: \"Of course, I can't sugar coat the fact that there will be a significant number of job losses and we will want to make sure we are treating people fairly, supporting them properly through that process.\" The Conservatives have welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\". The Liberal Democrats said the government should ensure that scrapping NHS England does not \"have negative impacts on the quality of care for patients\" and urged ministers to complete a review of social care.

        "title": "Under the flightpath: Life next to Leeds Bradford airport",
        "content": "Some of the houses on Glenmere Mount in Yeadon are in sight of the runway at Leeds Bradford Airport A public inquiry into night-time flying rules at Leeds Bradford Airport has been held over the past few days. The airport, in Yeadon, is currently allowed just under 3,000 take-offs and landings during the nights and early mornings in the summer months. However, campaigners say those limits have been breached in each of the past three years. But beyond all the rules, regulations and restrictions, what is it like to actually live next to the runway or under the take-off and landing routes at such a busy airport? Glenmere Mount in Yeadon is a quiet cul-de-sac of semi-detached bungalows and houses. Many of the residents have lived there for decades. An advert for a two-bedroom bungalow for sale on the Mount highlights the \"views of the planes\" as a perk of the property. Carol, whose back garden fence is about 980ft (300m) from the airport runway, has lived there for more than 20 years.  She says she was well aware of the airport when she moved to the property from elsewhere in Leeds. \"We just liked the area. We knew the airport existed, we realised it would get busier, but it's not caused us a major problem,\" she says. \"The main problem is the traffic and the infrastructure.\" Carol's point is backed up by the fact the estate is plastered with \"no parking\" signs - even one outside her own home which reads \"disabled parking required outside the front of this house\". She says holidaymakers are known to leave cars on their estate for two weeks at a time, but mostly the signs work and people are respectful. The Planning Inspector is unlikely to make a final decision on night flights from Leeds Bradford for several weeks or months John, who has lived at a nearby house on the estate for seven years, says the planes \"don't bother me at all\". \"I wouldn't live here if I didn't like the airport,\" he says. \"You get used to it. Even the early morning flights, I don't hear them. \"It's only if you're sitting out in the back garden and you're talking that you have to stop because of the noise. \"You've got a nice open field at the back that's not going to get built on. It's a lovely location, and there's Yeadon Tarn just down the road. You can't beat it, living here.\" John has lived on Glenmere Mount for seven years and is not bothered by noise from the airport On the Tarn, a small lake which is a popular dog-walking location less than 650ft (200m) from the airport's runway, some residents are more conflicted. Sally Pickersgill, 68, who has lived in Yeadon for four and a half years, says she initially liked living near the airport - however her views have since changed. Ms Pickersgill says she has more recently become concerned about the airport's environmental impact and the number of night flights. \"I don't believe they're a good neighbour any longer,\" Ms Pickersgill says. Under rules set out in 1994, the airport is permitted a total of 2,920 take offs and landings between 23:00 and 07:00 during the summer - a rule which campaigners from the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport claim has been broken for several years.  Vincent Hodder, the airport's chief executive has said the rules, agreed by Leeds City Council in 1994, do not take into account changes to aircraft technology over the past 30 years to reduce noise. The airport has also previously said it did \"accidentally\" breach the night time regulations in 2022, but it did not do so in 2023 and 2024, based on its interpretation of the rules. Ms Pickersgill says: \"The summer months have become a time where locals only get three to three-and-a-half hours of quiet at night. \"Irrespective of the airport trying to argue that one jet is more efficient than another, to anybody living under a flight path, a jet engine landing is a jet engine landing.\" Residents on the estate have made their own \"no parking\" signs in a bid to stop airport users from using their streets  Ms Pickersgill says she does not agree with claims about the proposed economic benefits of more flights from Leeds Bradford. \"We have lost most of our major business connection flights and what we're doing is flying more planes to holiday destinations in which the locals are starting to become over saturated,\" she says. Meanwhile, another woman named Carol, walking her dog Archie around the Tarn, says she agrees night flights are an issue for people living near the airport - but she also says she enjoys the convenience of the airport. Carol, who has lived in Yeadon since 1990, says: \"I know there's a pressure on flights, but it's residential around here. \"We fly from Leeds Bradford, so if there are more flights and we don't have to go to Manchester it's good for us.\" However, she adds that \"they need to do something about the night flying\". Carol says she often walks her dog Archie around Yeadon Tarn, which backs on to the airport Just over a mile south east of Leeds Bradford Airport is Horsforth, which sits under one of the two \"noise preferential routes\" for aircraft taking off - designated corridors in the air meant to minimise noise disturbance to the airport's neighbours. Martin and Claire have lived in the town all their lives, and Martin says the comings and goings at the airport \"never affect us\". \"Even sat in the garden, it's quite nice to hear them now and again,\" he says. Claire adds: \"I used to live on Brownberrie Lane under the flight path and it never bothered us there with having double glazing. You just get used to the noise.\" However, John, another life-long Horsforth resident, says he believes the general increase in flights from Leeds Bradford is \"detrimental\". \"It's got worse over the last few years,\" he says. \"Thirty years ago we used to get jumbo jets coming over, but it seems noisier now. \"The planes seem to be taking off both ways now and we get woken up at night, which is not great.\" While it is \"good for the economy\", it is \"not good for the local areas\", John says. Claire and Martin have lived in Horsforth all their lives and say the nearby airport does not affect them In Menston, on the north west side of the runway, David Crowther, 34, who has lived in the village for the last five years, says he uses the airport a lot for work. \"It's nice to have a busy airport that flies to more destinations more regularly - and it's good for the economy,\" he says. \"But with the noise and living under a flight path - those are the consequences you have to live with.\" Jo Hudson, 47, from nearby Otley, who walks her dog in Menston, says while she does not fly, she agrees the airport is good for the local economy. \"There are plenty of people who work up there,\" she says. \"It's got to be done. If people want to go on holiday, you've got to have a bigger airport.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

        "title": "Dozens feared dead in North Macedonian nightclub fire",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: North Macedonia nightclub ablaze Police have detained 15 people after a fire at a nightclub in North Macedonia killed at least 59 people, officials have said. The blaze broke out around 02:30 local time (01:30 GMT) on Sunday at the Pulse club in Kocani, where about 500 people had gathered for a concert by DNK, a popular hip-hop duo in the country. Only one member of the band survived and was being treated in hospital, a spokesman for the public prosecutor's office told the BBC's Newshour. In total, 155 were injured at the concert. Interior Minister Pance Toskovski has said the detainees will be questioned, adding that there are \"grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption\" linked to the fire. He said that the venue did not have a legal licence to operate. The venue, in a town around 100km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, has been described as an \"improvised nightclub\" in the local press, having previously been a carpet warehouse. Biljana Arsovska, spokesperson for the public prosecutor's office, said there had been only \"one efficient exit\" in the building, as the venue's back door was locked and could not be used.  The first on-site inspections on Sunday had also showed several \"abnormalities\" in the venue. \"There are deficiencies in the system for fire-extinguishing and the system for lightning,\" she said. Citing initial reports, Toskovski said the fire had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that had hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material. Hundreds of people were said to have been attending a concert by the band DNK Footage shows the band - which formed in 2002 and has topped the North Macedonian charts over the past decade - playing on stage when two flares go off, after which sparks catch fire on the ceiling before spreading rapidly.  Video verified by the BBC shows people trying to extinguish the flames on the ceiling. The footage shows the club was still full and some people appeared to be watching efforts to put out the fire rather than leaving. Reports suggest the fact there was only a single entry and exit point to the improvised nightclub caused panic. Marija Taseva, 20, told Channel 5 TV she was caught in a crush at the club as people rushed for the exits. She recalled falling to the ground and being trampled during the chaos before managing to get out. \"I don't know how, but somehow I managed to get out,\" she told the Reuters news agency. \"I'm fine now, but there are many dead.\" She added that her 25-year-old sister - who her family had previously been searching for - had died, saying: \"I was saved and she wasn't.\" Marija Taseva tells reporters everybody started screaming as the fire broke out, but there was \"only one exit\" Red Cross volunteer Mustafa Saidov said most of those affected were young people aged 18 to 20.  Officials say more than 20 of the injured and three of those killed were under 18. \"The situation is brutal, chaotic, the stories are very sad, and unfortunately many young lives are lost,\" Mr Saidov added. Dr Vladislav Gruev, a specialist in reconstructive and plastic surgery at the University Clinic for Surgical Diseases in the capital, told the BBC most of the patients being treated at his hospital arrived with extensive burns. \"[They have] second and third degree burns in the head, neck and upper torso,\" he said. Kocani's hospital director earlier said that staff had initially been struggling to identify patients due to a lack of ID cards. Eighteen patients were assessed as being in a critical condition. Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski called it a \"difficult and very sad day\" for the country, which had lost many \"young lives\". The government has declared seven days of national mourning, and the government is holding an emergency session as part of ongoing investigations on how the incident unfolded. North Macedonia's President, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, said she was shocked \"as a mother, as a person, as a president\". Addressing the bereaved directly, she added: \"Your immense pain is mine too.\" \"No business or activity can function without standards and rules,\" she wrote in a statement. \"Let us not allow anyone to endanger the lives of innocent people again.\" Siljanovska-Davkova added that the most seriously injured were being taken to received treatment in specialist clinics in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey.  European leaders have voiced their condolences, with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen saying the EU \"stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this difficult time\". Neighbouring Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic called it \"a tragedy of immense magnitude\", adding that fears remain as \"many more people will not be able to withstand the level of injuries they have at this moment\".

        "title": "Noise: The invisible killer in all our lives",
        "content": "James Gallagher recording sound levels around Barcelona We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives. It's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia. What do you think it could be? The answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing. \"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London. It's just a crisis we don't talk about. So I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world. I started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch. It's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats. You can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel. This video can not be played Listen to five different noises in under a minute: How do they make you feel? The one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam. And the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more. \"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared. Only the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response. LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer? But why is sound changing my body? \"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark. Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region â the amygdala â performs the emotional assessment. This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes. \"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me. All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage. \"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark. Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story. \"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark. Coco's health is being damaged by the noise where she lives Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes â are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise. I meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de GrÃ cia area of Barcelona, Spain. There's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie. From the balcony you can see the city's famous basilica, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave. \"It's extremely noisyâ¦ it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks. She gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate. Her home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\". She has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says. In Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization. Dr Maria Foraster says traffic noise has the biggest impact on health as it is so common Across Europe, external noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health. I meet Dr Foraster at a cafÃ© that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here. We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume. The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks. \"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster. And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says. Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise. Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend. \"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says. A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise. The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own. Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road â my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels â and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s. Natalie Mueller on a now quiet street that used to flow with traffic But there is something different about this street â it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old crossroads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly. Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body. \"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.  People walk in a pedestrian area as part of the superblock plan in Barcelona. The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together. Dr Mueller performed the research, external projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits. But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment. The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities. Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns. Artist Mominur Rahman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem. For about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance. Mominur Rahman Royal He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says. \"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\" But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise. There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws. She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\" The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve. What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".

        "title": "'I feel sick at the prospect of cuts to health benefits'",
        "content": "Emily says her autism makes it harder to establish a proper routine People currently claiming long-term sickness and disability benefits have shared their concerns about an overhaul of the welfare system. The government has announced plans for major changes to benefits, which you can read about in detail here. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall says the measures will encourage claimants to work, or work more and save Â£5bn a year by 2030. Many people got in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News to say how changes to the benefits system could affect them. Emily, 41, from Croydon, is autistic and struggles with time management and organising basic tasks for her daily routine.  She works full-time as a flight attendant after developing strategies to help organise her day, and also receives a Personal Independence Payment (Pip) of more than Â£400 a month. But the money mostly goes on her regular bills, rather than on the occupational therapy she thinks would really help her to establish a proper routine. Emily watched Liz Kendall's announcement and says it was \"frustrating how unclear it all was\".  From November 2026, Pip claimants will have to score at least four points in one activity to receive the daily living component of Pip. Emily's benefit is not due for review until 2031 but the government wants more frequent reassessments for many Pip claimants, and she fears that for people like her with autism, the stricter assessments could mean the loss of the benefit. \"We don't necessarily need help with physical things like going to the bathroom but need help with reminders,\" she says. \"It's scary. Even if I'm not called up for reassessment [before 2031], the criteria have changed â so it could mean changes for me in the future.\" Receiving Pip means Emily is eligible for a disabled discount railcard, which makes travel to work more affordable, and if she were to lose that she says she would struggle with the cost of getting to work. Lorraine says there should be more rigorous checks for benefit payments Lorraine, 62, from Northwich in Cheshire broadly agrees with the plans for stricter assessments of Pip. She used to be a director of adult services at various councils and has been a \"gatekeeper of public money\", so was surprised when her husband received Pip for his dementia with little scrutiny. \"I was shocked by the ease with which it was granted. I was expecting to be interviewed, rightly so, but it was awarded without interview and he received backdated pay for the maximum amount.\" She was also surprised that her husband got mobility allowance for not having a car, even though she had a car and could drive him around.  Lorraine says there should be more rigorous checks to see if family support is given, and that \"the state shouldn't compensate for everything\".  At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up What are the benefits changes and who will be affected? Faisal Islam: Hundreds of thousands will be affected by benefits changes Analysis: Starmer's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma Verify: Does cutting benefits actually work? Daisy, 22, from west London, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia. Pip has been her main source of support since she was 19, after previously struggling with a short-term job due to her conditions. She says all the recent talk about changes to Pip increased her anxiety and she had to see her doctor about it. \"If I don't have Pip I'll be a burden to my family,\" she says. After the government's announcement, Daisy checked her records and found she scored four out of eight on \"mixing with others\" so she shouldn't be affected by the eligibility change and is not due for reassessment until 2027, but says there are \"no guarantees\". She thinks the decision to make cuts \"lacks empathy and goes against why people voted for this party in the first place\". John welcomes the plan for those with the most severe, long-term conditions to no longer be reassessed John, 60, in Salford, used to work in dementia care but has been unable to return to employment after a spinal injury seven years ago. He says reassessments cause \"unnecessary stress\", adding that he has argued with officials in the past when he's been waiting for an operation and \"they're still making me go through an assessment\". Under the government's plans, those with the most severe, long-term conditions will no longer face any reassessments, something that John welcomes. \"Not having to be assessed would mean I could concentrate on going to my hospital appointments. Yesterday, I had to spend the whole day sorting out an issue with my universal credit. It would mean I could focus.\" Tracy says not having the right support in applying for jobs could cause more harm than good for people like her Tracy, 44, watched Liz Kendall's speech at a community cafÃ© in Salford. She is unable to work after a brain injury. \"I would love to be back in work, but I would need the right support,\" she says. She is open to the idea of \"right to try\", which would allow people to attempt to get back into work without losing access to benefits, but says there need to be procedures in place. \"If I was left with no support, it would cause more harm than good. Sometimes I use the wrong words. I don't want to be causing harm if I don't have the support that I needed.\" Alba applied for Pip but was turned down Alba, 53, is an IT contractor in Dorking who is currently working for one of the airports near London. She suffers with chronic back pain following two \"quite severe\" motorbike accidents, and during a period of unemployment last year she applied for disability support but was told she was not eligible. She says they were fair in assessing her and in their conclusion that she can do some work, but she wanted recognition for the pain she is in. She says the latest measures seem \"fair on paper\" but worries it will affect \"people like myself who are 'body abled' but still suffering from chronic pain daily\". \"The fact is that benefits are not sufficient for a comfortable daily living as they are, as people with pain and disability require items which are on average more expensive than standard, for example, orthopaedic mattresses to enable them to be able to sleep.\" Alba's current employer has been \"extremely helpful\" in letting her work from home, a subject she has spoken to the BBC about before. \"I don't want to claim benefits â it's horrible. It's not my style,\" she adds. \"I don't want to stay at home doing nothing.\" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Share your experiences.

        "title": "Trump blocked from using Alien Enemies Act for deportations",
        "content": "Trump speaking to reporters on Friday A federal judge has stopped US President Donald Trump from using a 227-year-old law meant to protect the US during wartime to carry out mass deportations of Venezuelans. Trump proclaimed on Saturday that immigrants belonging to the Venezuelan crime gang Tren de Aragua were \"conducting irregular warfare\" against the US and that he would deport them under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. But US District Judge James Boasberg that same evening ordered a halt to deportations covered by the proclamation lasting for 14 days, according to media reports. Judge Boasberg told a hearing he had heard planes with deportees were taking off and ordered them turned back, the Washington Post reported. The law allows the US to detain and remove people threatening the country's safety during wartime, without having to follow due process. It was last invoked to intern people of Japanese descent during World War Two. There was little surprise over the proclamation on Saturday, where Trump declared that Tren de Aragua was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\". He had promised to use the controversial law for mass deportations during last year's campaign. YvÃ¡n Gil Pinto, Venezuela's minister of foreign affairs, denounced the White House's decision to use the centuries-old measure. The country \"categorically and forcefully rejects the proclamation\", Pinto said in a statement, \"which infamously and unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\".  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other rights group had already sued to block him from using it on Saturday before he issued the proclamation. At a hearing, the judge said the terms \"invasion\" and \"predatory incursion\" in the law \"really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by enemy nations\", and that the law probably did not offer a good basis for Trump's proclamation, according to the New York Times. An ACLU lawyer had told the New York Times he believed there were two planes of Venezuelan immigrants in the air on Sunday. The BBC has not verified that report. The case will now move through the legal system and could go all the way to the Supreme Court. The proclamation, and the fight around it, should rally Trump's supporters, who largely returned him to the White House on his pledges to crack down on illegal immigration and bring down prices of everyday goods. Since he was inaugurated in January, he has swiftly worked to overhaul the US immigration system. Rights groups, along with some legal experts, are calling the invocation unprecedented, noting the Alien Enemies Act has been used in the past after the US officially declared war against other countries. Under the constitution, only Congress can declare war. All Venezuelan citizens in the US who are at least 14 years old, members of Tren de Aragua, and \"are not actually naturalised or lawful permanent residents\" were to be  \"apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies\", under Trump's order. Trump did not lay out how US officials would determine that a person is a member of the violent, transnational gang in the proclamation. By using this law, instead of immigration laws that already give him \"ample authority\" to deport the gang's members, Trump would not have to prove that detainees are part of Tren de Aragua, Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement. \"He wants to bypass any need to provide evidence or to convince a judge that someone is actually a gang member before deporting them,\" she added.  \"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings.\" US unveils new app for 'self-deportations'  Six big immigration changes under Trump - and their impact so far Trump cancels oil deal in major blow to Venezuela Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Gene Hackman's will excludes children and leaves $80m fortune for late wife",
        "content": "The will of legendary actor Gene Hackman has been released, but uncertainty lingers over his $80m (Â£62m) fortune. The two-time Academy Award winner left his entire estate to his wife of 30 years, Betsy Arakawa. But Arakawa, 65, was found dead alongside her husband in their New Mexico home last month. Legal experts have now said that, because authorities say Arakawa died seven days before her husband, Hackman's children could now potentially inherit his fortune, despite not being named in the will. His three children with his late ex-wife, Faye Maltese - Christopher, 65, Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58 - have not commented publicly on the matter. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting Legal documents obtained by the BBC show Hackman, 95, named Arakawa as his sole beneficiary in 1995, with the last update to the will in 2005. However, California attorney Tre Lovell told the BBC that the estate could default to them under succession laws, as long as there was no other beneficiary named. \"The estate will actually be probated in accordance with intestate succession laws and the children would be lawfully next in line to inherit,\" he said.  They would also need to prove that the will is invalid because Arakawa died before Hackman, he added. Authorities say Arakawa passed away on 11 February after contracting a rare virus,   days before Hackman died of natural causes. The couple was found dead in separate rooms of their $4m Santa Fe home on 26 February  after neighbourhood security conducted a welfare check and saw their bodies on the ground through a window.   Arakawa was found in the bathroom with pills scattered nearby, while Hackman was in the back of the house, wearing sweatpants and slippers, his cane and sunglasses beside him.  Officials determined he died seven days after his wife due to severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's listed as a contributing factor. Authorities initially deemed the scene \"suspicious\" but later ruled out foul play. 'Living in a reel': How Alzheimer's left Gene Hackman alone in his final days What is hantavirus, disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife? Obituary: One of Hollywood's greatest 'tough guys' Arakawa's own will left her assets to Hackman, with a provision that if they died within 90 days of each other, her estate would go to a trust and later be donated to charity  after covering medical expenses. Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa were married for more than 30 years.  Hackman has in the past discussed his relationship with his children. \"You become very selfish as an actor,\" he told The New York Times in 1989. \"Even though I had a family, I took jobs that would separate us for three or four months at a time.

        "title": "Plan to freeze PIP disability benefits may be dropped",
        "content": "The work and pensions secretary will unveil changes to the benefits system next week Ministers are considering abandoning plans to freeze some disability benefits, the BBC understands. Initial reports had suggested Personal Independence Payments (PIP) would not rise in line with inflation for a year, but many usually loyal Labour MPs have voiced strong opposition in meetings in No10, as well as to party whips and ministers. The eligibility criteria for PIP will be tightened with the government expected to cut billions of pounds from the welfare budget, but dropping the freeze could avoid a potentially damaging vote in the Commons.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he had not seen the plans but Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall wanted \"to support people who need help the most\". Could Starmer be in for a benefits rebellion as tribes clash in his own party? Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions Does cutting benefits actually work? Streeting told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"I haven't seen the proposals but you've seen the briefing, you've seen the speculation, I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.\" On the same programme, Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform. Kendall will set out details of reforms to welfare in a green paper next week. Part of the reform will also include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.  Streeting said he thought there was an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\" and not getting the support they need. \"So if you can get that support to people much earlier, then you can help people to either stay in work or get back to work,\" he added. After Liz Kendell lays out her plans, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will then reveal the full scale of welfare spending reductions, expected to be between Â£5bn and Â£6bn, in her Spring Statement on 26 March.   On Friday she said the government needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, saying the system is not working for the taxpayer or recipients.  Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from Â£64.7bn in 2023-24 to Â£100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is PIP. In 2023-24, PIP totalled Â£18bn, a figure projected to almost double to Â£34bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million. PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work. With Labour holding a large Commons majority, a freeze to PIP would be likely to pass a vote, but internal divisions would be highlighted. Sources told the BBC the measures to be announced would still be difficult and restricting who qualifies for PIP was likely to concern some Labour MPs. Even with the tighter eligibility measures planned, sources said spending on PIP would still rise but not as quickly as otherwise forecast. A number of MPs broadly supportive of welfare reform have told the BBC they have received assurances that severely disabled people would not be expected to work and would not lose entitlement to benefits. The expected changes to the benefit system come after the government announced it would be axing NHS England, the arms-length body currently responsible for running the health service in England.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: \"We have been clear that the current welfare system is broken and needs reform, so that it helps long-term sick and disabled people who can work to find employment, ensuring people receive the support they need, while being fair to the taxpayer. \"Without reform more people will be locked out of jobs, despite many wanting to work. That is not just bad for the economy, it's bad for people too.\" Disability benefit cuts test loyalty of Labour MPs Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Donald Trump launches wave of air strikes on Yemen's Houthis",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: US launches air strikes towards Houthi rebels in Yemen The US has launched a \"decisive and powerful\" wave of air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen, President Donald Trump has said, citing the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as the reason. \"Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at US aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies,\" Trump said on social media, adding that their \"piracy, violence, and terrorism\" had cost \"billions\" and put lives at risk. The Houthi-run health ministry said at least 31 people were killed and 101 others were injured in the strikes. The group later said it would continue to target Red Sea shipping until Israel lifted its blockade of Gaza, and that its forces would respond to the strikes. The Houthis reported a series of explosions on Saturday evening in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and in the northern province of Saada - the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.  The Iranian-backed rebel group, which considers Israel its enemy, controls Sanaa and the north-west of Yemen, but it is not the country's internationally recognised government. Unverified images show plumes of black smoke over the area of Sanaa's airport - which includes a military facility. In a statement, the Houthis blamed the US and the UK for \"wicked\" aggression targeting residential areas in Sanaa. The UK did not participate in Saturday's US strikes against the Houthi targets but it did provide routine refuelling support for the US. The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK. Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking ships? Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. These attacks, Trump said, \"will not be tolerated\". He added: \"We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\" The Houthis have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels, or by multiple rounds of US and British air strikes on its military targets. Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since July, in retaliation to the 400 missiles and drones that the Israeli military said had been launched at the country from Yemen, most of which were shot down. Major shipping companies have been forced to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and use a much longer route around southern Africa instead. Trump said that it had been more than a year since a US-flagged ship had sailed safely through the Suez Canal - which the Red Sea leads to - and four months since a US warship had been through the body of water between east Africa and the Arabian peninsula. The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe, and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Addressing the Houthis directly, Trump wrote that if they did not stop, \"HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE\". But the Houthis were unwavering in their response, saying the aggression would not diminish their support for Palestinians. \"This aggression will not go without response and our Yemeni armed forces are ready to answer escalation with further escalation,\" the group said.  Trump urged Iran to cease its support for the Houthis, warning that Washington would hold Tehran \"fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it\". He also accused the previous White House administration, under Joe Biden, of being \"pathetically weak\" and allowing the \"unrestrained Houthis\" to keep going. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the US government had \"no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy\". \"End support for Israeli genocide and terrorism,\" he posted on X on Sunday. \"Stop killing of Yemeni people.\" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also discussed military deterrence operations against the Houthis when he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday. Rubio emphasised that \"continued Houthi attacks on US military and commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea will not be tolerated\", a State Department spokesperson said. Lavrov, for his part, stressed the need for \"an immediate cessation of the use of force\" and the \"importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue in order to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed\", said the Russian foreign ministry.

        "title": "Arlington Cemetery strips content on black and female veterans from website",
        "content": "Arlington National Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery has scrubbed from its website information and educational materials about the history of black and female service members.  Some of the content removed from the site was on veterans who had received the nation's highest military recognition, the Medal of Honor, according to military news site Task & Purpose. The content removal is part of a larger effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices in the military and throughout the federal government. Approximately 400,000 veterans are buried in the Army-run cemetery, which was established after the US Civil War at the home of the South's general, Robert E. Lee. On the cemetery's website, internal links that directed users to webpages with information about the \"Notable Graves\" of dozens of black, Hispanic and female veterans were missing on Friday.  The pages contained short biographies about veterans such as Gen Colin L Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is the highest rank in the military after the president.  They also told the life stories of members of the Tuskegee Airmen, the country's first black military airmen.  Earlier this year, the Defense Department had to reinstate training materials on the revered airmen after a national outcry over their removal following Trump's orders on DEI. Information on Hector Santa Anna, a World War II bomber pilot and career military leader who has been called a hero of the war, has been taken down, as well. Visitors to the site may also have trouble finding information, as links to major sections have disappeared. It no longer lists pages for African American History, Hispanic American History and Women's History. Content still exists on some notable women buried there, including former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 14 veterans from the unit recently featured in the Oscar-nominated movie The Six Triple Eight, but it is only found from a direct search. Since re-entering the White House, President Donald Trump has signed multiple executive orders banning DEI within the federal government. A spokesperson for the cemetery said in a statement it was working to restore links and content and remained \"committed to sharing the stories of military service and sacrifice to the nation\", according to the Washington Post.  It added that it wanted to ensure that the content aligned with Trump's orders and also with instructions from Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the content removal. \"The whole thing is deeply concerning,\" Smith said in an interview with the New York Times.  \"Even if you have concerns about the way DEI was handled in a number of different places, I've never seen a problem within the military.\" Trump has made dramatic changes in the military in his second term, including firing the country's top general, CQ Brown, a black man who had supported diversity in the armed forces. Secretary Hegseth - a former Fox News host and military veteran - has pledged to root out all diversity initiatives and had accused Gen Brown of being \"woke\".  There are 2.03m people serving in the US military on active duty or in reserves, with 30% identifying as part of a minority group such as black or Native American and 18% as Hispanic or Latino, according to the latest Defense Department report. One-fifth of those in the military are women.

        "title": "Military planning for Ukraine peace moves to 'operational phase', says Starmer",
        "content": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said military planning to protect a potential Ukraine ceasefire is moving to an \"operational phase\" after a virtual meeting with 29 other world leaders. Military leaders will meet in London on Thursday \"to put strong and robust plans in place to swing in behind a peace deal and guarantee Ukraine's future security\", Sir Keir said. The meeting follows Ukraine agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire after talks with the US. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he agrees with the idea, but set a number of pre-conditions for peace. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who joined Saturday's meeting, said \"active pressure is needed, not just talks\". \"The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace,\" he said. \"The path to peace must begin unconditionally. If Russia doesn't want this, then strong pressure must be applied until they do. Moscow understands one language,\" Zelensky added. He urged European countries to produce their own weapons as soon as possible and to talk to the US and its President Donald Trump to reach a deal more quickly through \"full sanctions, strong pressure, and forcing Russia to make peace\". In a speech after the video call, Sir Keir said \"the world needs actions...not empty words and conditions\". In a statement, he said the \"Kremlin's dithering and delay\" over the ceasefire proposal and its continued attacks on Ukraine \"run entirely counter to President Putin's stated desire for peace\". Leaders agreed on Saturday that if Putin refused an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" they would need to \"ratchet up pressure...to convince him to come to the negotiating table\", Sir Keir said. \"To deliver this, we will accelerate our military support, tighten our sanctions on Russia's revenues, and continue to explore all lawful routes to ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has done to Ukraine,\" the statement read. Putin said on Thursday he supported the idea of a ceasefire, but added \"there are nuances\" and asked a list of questions about details, including whether a ceasefire would allow Ukraine to rearm and who would police it. Starmer's ad hoc alliance could still struggle to materialise Putin sets out conditions for Ukraine ceasefire Participants in Saturday's call included Nato, the European Union, nearly two dozen European countries, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  Military chiefs will meet this week to move forward on \"practical plans\" for how their militaries can support Ukraine, Sir Keir said. \"We will build up Ukraine's own defences and armed forces, and be ready to deploy as a 'coalition of the willing' in the event of a peace deal, to help secure Ukraine on the land, at sea, and in the sky,\" his statement read. Sir Keir introduced the idea of a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a ceasefire earlier this month, and on Saturday said it had grown and includes backing from Japan and others. The prime minister has previously said he is \"ready and willing\" to put UK troops in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. He has called on other European countries to commit to concrete security guarantees, and said a US \"backstop\" is needed. In a news conference after the summit, Zelensky said there was a need for some form of \"boots on the ground\" after the ceasefire, although he admitted some were \"sceptical\". Finnish President Alexander Stubb told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg after the summit that it is \"still too early\" to talk about putting troops on the ground as part of any security guarantee. Stubb said Finland was willing to be part of efforts to defend a peace deal, but said: \"It is too early to talk about boots on the ground because we don't have a ceasefire, we don't have a peace process. Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments.\" He said there was \"anywhere from zero to 50 different ways they can help out, boots on the ground is only one way\". Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

        "content": "This video can not be played US tornadoes: Extreme weather leaves trail of destruction At least 34 people have died in the US after violent tornadoes tore through several south-eastern states, flipping cars and flattening homes. In Kansas, a dust storm on Friday afternoon caused a crash with more than 50 vehicles, killing at least eight people. Texas saw a similar mass pile-up. A state of emergency has been declared in several states, including Arkansas, Georgia and Oklahoma, where more than 100 wildfires were raging. A third day of severe weather was forecast for Sunday, with flash flooding and more tornado warnings issued across the region. The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of \"intense to violent\" tornadoes, describing the situation as \"particularly dangerous\". \"Get to the sturdiest structure you have access to and remain in place until the storms pass,\" the NWS told residents in Alabama on Saturday night, when multiple tornado warnings were issued. At least 250,000 properties across the US were without power on Sunday morning, according to tracker PowerOutage. In Missouri, where at least 12 people died, Governor Mike Kehoe said the state had been \"devastated by severe storms... leaving homes destroyed and lives lost\". Initial reports showed 19 tornadoes had struck 25 counties in the state, its emergency management agency said. A home belonging to one of those killed was torn apart. \"It was unrecognisable as a home. Just a debris field,\" Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. \"The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.\" Alicia Wilson, who was evacuated from her Missouri home, told local TV station KSDK: \"It was the scariest thing I've ever been through - it was so fast, our ears were all about to burst.\" A woman in Mississippi described how terrified her daughter was. \"All I could hear was my six year old screaming that she didn't want to die - you don't want to hear that coming out of your baby's mouth,\" Jericho McCoy said.

As of Saturday, it said there had been 112 fire-related injuries reported by hospitals in the state. Governor Kevin Stitt, who visited his own ranch to find he had \"lost everything to the fires\", said the damage in the state was unbelievable. \"Oklahomans, we are in this together and we will build back stronger,\" he said. Entire streets were wiped out in Mannford, Oklahoma Residents in Mannford, Oklahoma, were ordered to evacuate on Friday afternoon as the fires tore through the region In the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, more than 50 homes were lost to fire 1 of 3 Tornadoes form when moist, warm air rises, mixing with cold air above to generate thunderclouds. Winds blowing from different directions cause the air to rotate, creating a vortex of air that moves upwards. Several states, including Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas, lie within so-called Tornado Alley - a path frequently hit by the weather phenomenon, as the geography is ideal for their formation. Peak tornado season in the region is from May to June - but meteorologists caution that they can occur at any time of year. Have you been personally affected by the tornadoes in the US?

Hyrox, a \"fitness racing\" event, will take place across three days between 30 May and 1 June 2025 in the Principality Stadium. The inaugural event in Germany saw 650 participants, but Hyrox says it now has 200,000 competitors dotted around the world.

How Hyrox became the latest sporting craze Hyrox: The new fitness trend sweeping the capital \"What we saw with Hyrox when they went to Glasgow recently was 40,000 people going to the city who wouldn't have gone to Glasgow,\" he said. \"What we want to see here in Cardiff is tens of thousands of people coming here at a time when most students will have left, so it's a quiet time for the city and therefore giving an economic boost at a time when they didn't expect that kind of money to come into the shops and restaurants.\" Participants run 1km (0.62 miles) before completing one fitness exercise, including 1km on a standing ski machine, 50m of sled push and 80m burpee jumps. Competitors - either professional or everyday fitness enthusiasts - repeat the process until they have performed eight runs and the eight workouts. The Ski Erg is one of the exercises competitors must complete  At the Colosseum Gym at Gwaelod y Garth just outside Cardiff, some gym-goers said they had already upped their training ahead of the competition. Mother and daughter duo Tracey Bennett, 44, and Grace, 15, said it was a chance to improve their fitness as well as spend time together. \"It's just like a really different type of training to what I'm used to it,\" said Grace.  \"It has the strength that we are used to in strength and conditioning but also the running and the quite intense cardio as well, which I really enjoy.\" Grace is too young to enter, but has encouraged her mum to try. \"I am now very much thinking about it thanks to Grace, who is waiting until she turns 16 to do one at the end of the year.  \"I'd say she's strongly encouraged me have a go. I'm not the most competitive, so I'll just go and have fun,\" Tracey said. Lauren owns a gym in Barry but also presents social media videos on behalf of Hyrox Lauren Smith, who owns a gym in Barry and also presents content for Hyrox's social media channels, said she believed the event would be \"huge\" for the Welsh capital. \"You already have this really lovely atmosphere of the athletes racing,\" she said, \"We're going to be doing it on the hallowed turf of the Welsh Rugby Union where we've won Grand Slams and lifted trophies and you're just going to be in the middle of that stadium.\" Fitness 'adds years to life' says Hyrox grandma  'I'm caring for my husband with MS - intense races help me cope' Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "content": " Why some Kenyan women are choosing to buck societal norms and undergo sterilisation. According to Kenya’s Health Ministry, between 2020 and 2023, about 16,000 women in Kenya decided to undergo a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation. While some of them already had children and didn’t want any more, others were saying no to motherhood altogether: they’re women who define themselves as child-free, meaning they have consciously decided never to have children. BBC Africa's Danai Nesta Kupemba has been looking into the this movement and has spoken to two Kenyan women who have recently committed to a child-free life.

        "title": "Elon Musk says first SpaceX mission to Mars will launch next year",
        "content": "SpaceX founder Elon Musk has said his Starship rocket will head to Mars by the end of next year, as the company investigates several recent explosions in flight tests. Human landings could begin as early as 2029 if initial missions go well, though \"2031 was more likely\", he added in a post on his social media platform X.  Starship -  the largest rocket ever created standing at 123m -  is crucial to Musk's ambitions to colonise the planet Mars. However it has suffered multiple failures in tests - one of the rockets exploded minutes after it was launched from Texas as part of a test last week, the second failure this year after a similar \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" in January. SpaceX said it would review data \"to better understand [the] root cause\" of the most recent explosion and noted it happened after the loss of \"several\" engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the company would be required to conduct an investigation before it could fly again. Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon. Debris was seen falling from the Bahamas after the rocket exploded last week.  The tech billionaire has grand designs that the rocket system will one day take humans to the Moon, and then on to Mars, making humans \"multi-planetary\". Musk has long targeted a trip to Mars. In 2016, he said he was planning to send his Dragon spacecraft as early as 2018. The billionaire said in 2020 that he remained confident that his company would land humans on Mars six years later.  In 2024, he said he would launch the first Starships to Mars, external in 2026, with plans to send crewed flights in four years.  Musk has said that the coming Mars mission would carry the Tesla humanoid robot \"Optimus\", which was shown to the public last year. Musk said the robot would one day be able to perform everyday tasks, and cost between $20,000 and $30,000. On Friday, SpaceX  launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a crew to the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a plan to bring two astronauts back home.  Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they came on, which was built by Boeing, they have been there for more than nine months.

        "title": "South African ambassador 'no longer welcome' in US, Rubio says",
        "content": "The US is expelling South Africa's ambassador to Washington, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio describing him as a \"race-baiting politician\".  In a post on X, Rubio accused Ebrahim Rasool of hating the US and President Donald Trump, and said the ambassador was \"no longer welcome in our great country\".  The office for South Africa's president on Saturday called the decision \"regrettable\", adding that the country remained committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the US. The rare move by the US marks the latest development in rising tensions between the two countries. While lower-ranking diplomats are sometimes expelled, it's highly unusual in the US for it to happen to a more senior official. In his post on Friday, Rubio linked to an article from the right-wing outlet Breitbart that quoted some of Rasool's recent remarks made during an online lecture about the Trump administration. At the event, Rasool said Trump was \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\" as the white population faced becoming a minority in the US. \"We see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the Maga movement as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white,\" he said.  He suggested that South Africa was under attack because \"we are the historical antidote to supremacism\". In response, Rubio called Rasool \"PERSONA NON GRATA\", referencing the Latin phrase for \"unwelcome person\".  Ties between the US and South Africa have been deteriorating since Trump took office.  Rasool (left) was sent to Washington again after gaining years of experience during his first stint An executive order last month - which froze US assistance to South Africa - cited \"unjust racial discrimination\" against white Afrikaners, largely descended from Dutch settlers who first arrived in the 17th Century.  It references a new law, the Expropriation Act, that it claims targets Afrikaners by allowing the government to take away private land.  \"As long as South Africa continues to support bad actors on the world stage and allows violent attacks on innocent disfavoured minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country,\" a statement from the White House said at the time.  South Africa's 2022 census noted that white people - including Afrikaners - made up 7.2% of the population. However, according to a 2018 land audit by the South African government, white farmers owned 72% of the country's individually-held farmland.  South Africa's government, which is made up of 10 parties led by the African National Congress (ANC), said earlier that the US president's actions were based on \"a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation\". It added no land had been seized without compensation and said this would only happen in exceptional circumstances, such as if land was needed for public use and all other avenues to acquire the land had been exhausted. A fact sheet from the White House states the country \"blatantly discriminates against ethnic minority descendants of settler groups\".  Rasool - who previously served as US ambassador from 2010 to 2015 - was himself forcibly removed from his home in Cape Town's District Six as a child after it was declared a white area under the Apartheid government. He would later describe the eviction as a significant moment in his upbringing which guided his future. Rasool became Pretoria's ambassador to the US again in 2024. Unnamed sources in the South African government told online news site Daily Maverick at the time that he was thought to be well placed to deal with a Trump administration because of the experience and contacts he had acquired during his first stint as ambassador.

        "title": "Stress, burnout and hope: NHS workers in London speak out",
        "content": "London nurse Cielito Caneja \"You have moments when you're human and feel overwhelmed. My way of coping is to take a deep breath, and if I have a chance, go for a 30-second break outside, come back in, then smile again.\" Cielito Canejo is a specialist respiratory practitioner. Like many of her NHS colleagues in London, she experiences times of pressure and stress at work. The Covid-19 pandemic caused her to reflect more on her mental well-being. \"The silver lining of the pandemic was that it raised awareness of mental health. For me personally, I no longer felt there was a stigma around it.\" While the pandemic is long over, the pressures on the NHS remain. Ms Canejo says she worries about the mental health of her colleagues across the sector. The latest NHS Staff Survey, published on 13 March, has ranked London as the second worst region in England for morale and burnout (behind the East of England) - with a third of the capital's health workers saying they \"often or always\" feel burnt out because of the job.  London also scored worst in the category of \"work pressure\", with three quarters saying they experienced unrealistic time pressures in their job. Across the NHS, millions of workdays are lost each year due to mental health issues with workload, psychological distress and the pandemic's impact being blamed. \"We worked through the pandemic, serving the nation, and we've had no recovery,\" says Dr Chaand Nagpaul, a north London GP.  \"And since then, we've had to deal with the biggest backlog of care in the NHS.  \"The number of patients needing to be seen far outweighs our capacity. This is a recipe for creating stress and burnout.\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul He says his GP surgery is in an area with one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the country.  Dr Nagpaul adds that the capital has pockets of deprivation where health issues are more common.  In addition, he says, compared with some other parts of the country, London GPs need more time, in order to provide care for patients who may have English as a second language and for asylum-seekers who may need more help with experiences of trauma. Dr Nagpaul co-chairs the charity Doctors in Distress. It offers support groups and this year is holding an urgent fundraising appeal to help meet demand. Within the NHS, various services are offered to try to help staff with their mental health.  For example, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust runs an in-house psychology service and offers on-site exercise sessions. It also brings support directly to staff in the form of a tea trolley. \"We go around with a 'well-being trolley'\", says Aderemi Shoyebo, \"bringing teas and coffees to staff who otherwise might not get a chance for a break.  \"We use it as an opportunity to find out if there's anything they need help with and signpost them to support services.\" For Ms Canejo, what helped was journalling, and becoming a mental health first aid instructor. Through helping others' mental well-being, she found it rewarding to her own. An NHS London spokesperson said NHS staff were working \"incredibly hard to meet rising demand and care for more patients than ever before, and we know this can take a toll on wellbeing\".  \"While there is more to do, the NHS is fully committed to ensuring staff get the support they need, and the health service is now offering more flexible working options than ever before, as well as a range of mental health support available for staff, including access to coaching and wellbeing resources.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson added: \"NHS staff have been overworked for years.  \"Through our Plan for Change, external we are turning the NHS around and giving staff the tools they need to deliver the best possible care to patients.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Alderley Edge: Supercar dispersal order in affluent village",
        "content": "Supercar drivers are blighting the village of Alderley Edge, councillors say People living in an affluent village have said the number of supercar drivers flocking to the area is damaging local businesses. Alderley Edge has seen a number of so-called \"supercar meets\" in recent years, which police have described as illegal.  One councillor said it was \"intrusive and deeply frustrating\" and some people stay away from the village as a result. Cheshire Police has put a dispersal order in place.  Ch Insp Zoe Bowden said she understood the \"frustration and anger that illegal car meets cause\". The police have launched a new operation after recent reports of events. The force has put a dispersal order in place from the village up to the roundabout on the A34 from 10am on Saturday (15 March) until 10pm the following day. Car meets can attract hundreds of people. The police said alarm and distress to residents have been caused by noise and anti-social behaviour, and that some of those attending park their vehicles in areas blocking highways. A noise-activated camera was installed on a trial-basis in 2022 after complaints from locals. \"This is an ongoing problem in the local area and I want to reassure residents that we are committed to doing all we can to tackle the issue,\" said Ch Insp Bowden said. She added the police were not targeting \"people meeting in their cars peacefully\", but those \"disrupting local communities and acting in an anti-social manner\". A recent video on social media showed a near miss with an Audi on the A34 roundabout near Alderley Edge. A spokesperson for Cheshire Police said the force was aware of the video. \"Enquiries in relation to the matter are ongoing and officers are working hard to establish the identity of the driver,\" they said. Car meets often take place on the main street through the village Craig Browne, who is an independent Cheshire East councillor for Alderley Edge and former deputy leader, said the village welcomed visitors \"as long as they're not causing anti-social behaviour issues\". \"No resident has any problem at all with nice vehicles driving through the village and coming to visit,\" he said. \"What is a problem is the manner in which some of the vehicles are being driven\". He said there were safety concerns, including examples he's seen of drivers doing doughnuts at junctions and large numbers of people standing on footpaths blocking elderly residents or those with pushchairs from getting through. \"They have to actually walk in the road to get around them, and of course that is a danger to them at any time, but particularly when there are an increased number of vehicles on the roads,\" he said. Local businesses say it impacts them, with one saying the events were a \"disaster\". \"I've seen a lot of our customers shying away, they don't come in\", they said. \"They're not contributing to the local economy but for me it's not about money, it's about safety and preventing people from enjoying their village.\" Another said the events cost them money. \"They don't shop in any of the shops, we all lose trade,\" they said. Meanwhile, villagers say they have safety concerns. \"It's quite dangerous because kids are in the road,\" said one lady. \"Maybe some guidelines on where's safe to be would be good, I wouldn't want to be a party pooper for the young kids that love it.\" One man said it should \"probably not\" take place around pedestrian areas. \"If it could be organised to be safer, but I get the appeal is to not be safe,\" he said. And another said he had seen people nearly get run over trying to take pictures. \"They should go and hire a race track,\" he said.

        "title": "Ukraine war latest: Starmer says military planning for future Ukraine peace deal moving to 'operational phase'",
        "content": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in a virtual summit of Ukraine allies, says the \"coalition of the willing\" is now moving to an \"operational phase\" of practical planning Starmer says the efforts to secure \"just and lasting peace\" brings together partners from across the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - with backing from others including Japan Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky was also in attendance - speaking after the summit he says a \"ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it\" In the midst of this blizzard of diplomacy, European officials are trying to persuade the Trump administration to offer a so-called \"backstop\", the BBC's Paul Adams writes Earlier this week, Putin set out conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine, but Zelensky called his response \"manipulative\" This video can not be played Coalition of the willing is moving to an operational phase - Starmer Edited by Matt Spivey and Sean Seddon Lana LamLive digital reporter Now is the time to put \"maximum pressure on Russia\", Keir Starmer says, as international collaborations to bring peace to Ukraine saw the \"coalition of the willing\" vow to move to an \"operational phase\" of practical planning. In a news conference shortly after a virtual summit, Starmer says the coalition is bigger than it was two weeks ago - when the term was first floated after a meeting of European leaders and Canada.  As negotiations continue on Ukraine's future, the world will be watching closely.  Ukraine's allies will meet once again on Thursday for military talks, with the aim of nailing down the details on what types of support will be on the table if a ceasefire deal is agreed. We're pausing our live coverage for now, but you can stay across the latest developments in our news story. Paul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent Keir Starmer says the \"coalition of the willing\" is now bigger and that ânew commitmentsâ are on the table, though he didnât spell these out.  This morningâs participants, he said, had agreed to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine and tighten restrictions on the Russian economy, to weaken Vladimir Putinâs war machine.  Planning, he said, would now move to an âoperational phaseâ, with military chiefs due to meet in the UK next Thursday.  âOverall, we are successfully gathering political and military momentum,â he said.  Itâs likely that weâll see a rolling set of political, diplomatic and military gatherings as the plan slowly takes shape.  Itâs far from plain sailing.  Asked about vital US military support for any European-led operation â whatâs being called a âbackstopâ â the prime minister was clear: the US position had not changed.  European national security advisors, including Jonathan Powell - one of those credited with convincing President Zelensky to accept the US ceasefire proposal - were in Washington yesterday.  Unless Donald Trumpâs position on the backstop changes, Keirâs coalition of the willing could struggle to get off the ground. Lana LamLive reporter As conversations continue over a possible peace deal for Ukraine, we've taken stock of what some of the key players have been saying in recent days: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky  Russia's President Vladimir Putin  US President Donald Trump Cachella SmithLive reporter The notion of seizing frozen Russian assets was one of the topics discussed by leaders in the meeting earlier today.  Calling it \"complicated\", the prime minister did say the conversation on this would continue. It comes after other political figures, including his own foreign secretary, David Lammy, have positioned themselves in favour. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, around $325bn worth of assets were frozen by the G7, alongside the EU - that's a financial sanction imposed by the government which restricts named individuals and entities from accessing assets held in the country.   As a reminder, the UK is currently using the proceeds from these assets to support Ukraine. Other European countries are doing the same.  However, actually seizing them could come up against legal issues in international law.  The European Central Bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has previously warned that such a move risked \"breaking the international order... you would want Russia to respect\". Earlier this month, Lagarde said it was not a debate for the European Central Bank. However, she added: \"The international law basis on which any decision is made will matter as far as other investors are concerned.\"  Starmer today said sanctions will continue in a bid to \"bring [Putin] to the table\" but a decision on seizing assets remains to be made.  Laura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Finnish President Alexander Stubb has told the BBC that it is \"still too early\" to talk about putting troops on the ground as part of peacekeeping forces in Ukraine after the prime minister's summit this morning.  Earlier, Keir Starmer said military planning would move into an \"operational phase\" with a meeting this Thursday.  Stubb said that Finland was willing to be part of efforts to defend a peace deal, but \"it is too early to talk about boots on the ground because we don't have a ceasefire, we don't have a peace process\". \"Once we have a clear plan, we start doing the commitments,\" he says. There is \"anywhere from zero to 50 different ways they can help out, boots on the ground is only one way,\" Stubb says, and adds it is \"too early to commit\". Starmer has repeatedly called on other European countries to commit to concrete measures that could help provide security for Ukraine in the event that a ceasefire deal is reached.  Paul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent For President Zelensky, the military clock is ticking, especially in Kursk, where his troops have been occupying a shrinking sliver of Russian territory since last August.  Ukraine vehemently denies reports that its forces are surrounded in Kursk â a theory promoted by Donald Trump yesterday â but they are clearly under enormous pressure and theyâre losing ground.  When I was in Kyiv towards the end of last year, Ukrainian troops told us they were holding onto territory in Kursk as a bargaining chip to be played in future negotiations.  But as those negotiations approach, itâs a chip that Vladimir Putin seems determined to remove from the table first.  That may go some way towards explaining his âyes, butâ approach to the idea of a 30-day ceasefire. As we mentioned earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held a news conference following the virtual summit of Ukraine allies - here are the key takeaways: Putin must show support for the end of the war by agreeing to a ceasefire, Ukraine's president said, as he called the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah a \"diplomatic victory\". He outlined that security guarantees in Ukraine need to be \"reflected on paper\", amid his hopes that America will put \"pressure\" on Russia. Zelensky thanked the EU for its plan to put â¬150bn towards strengthening Europeâs defence capacity. On Ukraine's \"reconstruction\", as mentioned by both Turkey and Germany, Zelensky said this shows belief that the war can be ended. He said there is a need for some form of \"boots on the ground\" after the ceasefire, although he admitted that some are \"sceptical\". He added that Ukraine's army should be \"strengthened\" to guarantee future security. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says that his country \"will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes\", adding that \"it is the right thing to do\". Following the virtual summit, hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Albanese says on X that the war in Ukraine is a \"struggle for the international rule of law\". \"President Putin's regime has imperialist designs, for Ukraine and beyond,\" he continues. Albanese says that Australia has committed $1.5bn to Ukraine, which includes $1.3bn in military support and the training of Ukrainian forces. Some more now from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who says in a statement on X that \"Putin is lying to everyone\" about the situation in Kursk and the ceasefire deal.  Ukraine troops seized territory in Russia's Kursk region in a surprise attack last summer, but Russian forces have slowly been retaking areas. Putin claims Ukrainian soldiers  are now surrounded by Russian forces in the region, but Zelensky says there's no evidence for this. The Ukrainian leader adds that Putin is \"lying about how a ceasefire is supposedly too complicated\". \"The truth is, Putin has already dragged out the war for nearly a week after the talks in Jeddah. And he will keep dragging it out,\" he says.  We're hearing now from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who says that \"peace must begin unconditionally\" and \"if Russia doesn't want this, then strong pressure must be applied until they do\". Zelensky attended a virtual summit of Ukraine's allies earlier today, where he reiterated his belief that Russia's silence on the 30-day ceasefire shows that \"Putin will keep dragging\" the war out. \"A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it,\" he adds in a statement on X. \"This is Russiaâs war - more than three years of full-scale fighting and destruction,\" the post says. \"To stop this, active pressure is needed, not just talks.\" Security guarantees are \"key to making peace reliable and lasting\", he continues, and \"peace will be more reliable with European contingents on the ground and the American side as a backstop\". He ends with a call to unite not just Europe and the G7 but \"all other countries around the world for the sake of peace\". \"The world must understand that Russia is the only obstacle preventing peace.\" The Ukrainian president has also held a news conference following the virtual summit, which you can follow by clicking watch live at the top of this page. We will bring you the latest updates as we get them.  This video can not be played Coalition of the willing is moving to an operational phase - Starmer If you're just joining us, we've just heard Keir Starmer speaking following a virtual summit of 25 Ukraine allies, where future security arrangements and more sanctions on Russia were discussed. Here are the key takeaways:  Starmer says he does not accept the terms of peace talks need to be \"frozen as they are today\". \"If we apply pressure [on Putin], we show collective resolve and some clear-eyed leadership on this, we can move this forward to get the parties around the table for negotiations,\" he says.  The result of those negotiations needs to be the \"just and lasting peace\" that everybody wants, especially the Ukrainians, Starmer says.  Peace in Ukraine is \"very important\" to the defence and security of Europe as well as the UK because the impact of what happens in Europe \"always washes up on our shores\".  And with that, the press conference comes to an end. Starmer is asked whether Russia's frozen assets will be seized and what else could be done to apply pressure on Putin. Starmer says today's summit discussed ways to boost Ukraine's military capability in both the short and long term, something which he says will apply pressure on the Kremlin. He says \"fresh commitments\" were \"put on the table\" and he sees Ukraine playing an \"important\" part in its own security arrangements in the event of a peace deal. The prime minister adds that the leaders discussed \"how much further we can go\" in tightening sanctions on Russia, including whether Russia's frozen assets could be seized, a topic he calls a \"complicated question\". That conversation will continue, Starmer says, including on what more can be done with those assets. Starmer now takes a question from the BBC's Hannah Miller, who asks for examples of concrete commitments made during today's summit.  He says that much has changed since a meeting two weeks ago with European leaders on Ukraine's future. The group that met this morning is a \"bigger group than we had two weeks ago,\" he adds. We have a \"stronger collective resolve,\" Starmer says, and \"new commitments were put on the table this morning\" - but the prime minister does not disclose specific examples.  The attendees agreed that we must now move to an \"operational phase\", he continues, and we are gathering \"political and military momentum\". Starmer adds that now is the time for \"maximum pressure on Russia\".  Starmer says the \"coalition of the willing\" brings together partners from across the EU, as well as Canada, Australia and New Zealand and backing from others including Japan. He adds that the efforts of those supporting Ukraine must continue, including keeping \"military aid flowing\" and continuing sanctions to \"weaken Putin's war machine and bring him to the table\". He tells the press conference that the moment has come to \"accelerate practical work\" needed to move towards a peace deal. Moving into an \"operation phase\" will see military forces meeting on Thursday to back up a possible ceasefire.  \"This is the moment to keep driving towards the outcome that we want to see: to end the killing, a just and lasting peace in Ukraine and lasting security for all of us,\" he says. Keir Starmer begins by saying that Ukraine has shown \"beyond any doubt\" that it is the \"party of peace\" - and Russia's Vladimir Putin is \"trying to delay\". \"The world needs action...not empty words and conditions. So my message is clear, sooner or later, Putin will have to come to the table,\" he continues.  \"This is the moment that the guns fall silent,\" Starmer says.  The chaos created by Russia hurts people in the UK including by driving up living and energy costs, he says.  Keir Starmer has just started speaking at a press conference following this\nmorning's virtual summit, where 26 countries joined in a call to discuss support\nfor Ukraine if a ceasefire is agreed on.  We'll bring you his comments as soon as we get them.  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni attended today's virtual summit, her office has confirmed - but she says Italy does not intend to participate in a military presence in Ukraine. As we reported earlier, there was some doubt about whether she would join the meeting at all. In a statement, her office says: \"[Meloni] confirmed that Italy intends to continue working with European and Western partners and with the United States to define credible and effective security guarantees, reiterating that national participation in a possible military force on the ground is not envisaged.\" The virtual summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has concluded, Downing Street says.  The prime minister is due to speak at a press conference shortly, where we'll find out more about what was discussed at the meeting. We'll be bringing you further updates as soon as we have them.  Paul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent Donât expect\nthe announcement of any concrete plans for the Anglo-French led âcoalition of\nthe willingâ today.  \nThis is very much a work in progress. The concept has only been in circulation\nfor a fortnight.  Its fundamental purpose - to help keep the peace in the\nevent of a ceasefire in Ukraine - is clear, but there is no operational plan\nyet. What Keir Starmer is trying to do is determine how broad the coalition will\nbe and what assets - troops, equipment and money - countries will be willing to\ncommit. Itâll then be up to military chiefs, who are due to meet next week, to turn commitments\ninto concrete plans. In the midst of\nthis blizzard of diplomacy, European officials are trying to persuade the Trump\nadministration to offer the sort of critical US military support â a so-called\nâbackstopâ â without which any European-led peacekeeping effort would almost\ncertainly founder.

        "title": "Ovens and bone fragments - BBC visits Mexican cartel 'extermination' site",
        "content": "Three human crematory ovens were located at the Izaguirre Ranch at the beginning of March The gates to the Izaguirre Ranch look much like any others you might find in the state of Jalisco. Two prancing horses on the front perhaps a nod to the surrounding cattle-grazing and sugarcane fields. Yet what lies behind the black iron doors is allegedly evidence of some of Mexico's worst drug cartel violence of recent times. Following a tip-off about the possible location of a mass grave, an activist group of relatives of some of Mexico's thousands of disappeared people went to the ranch, hoping to find some sign of their missing loved ones. What they found was far worse: 200 pairs of shoes, hundreds of items of clothing, scores of suitcases and rucksacks, discarded after the owners themselves were apparently disposed of. Even more chilling, several ovens and human bone fragments were found at the ranch.  The site was used, the activists claim, by the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG) for the forced recruitment and training of their foot-soldiers, and for torturing their victims and cremating their bodies. \"There were children's toys in there,\" says Luz Toscano, a member of the Buscadores Guerreros de Jalisco Collective.  Luz Toscano is a member of the Buscadores Guerreros de Jalisco Collective - the group that first uncovered the site \"People were desperate,\" she recalls. \"They'd see the shoes and say: 'those look like the ones my missing relative was wearing when they disappeared'.\"  Toscano believes the authorities must now go through all the personal effects piece by piece and make them available to the families for closer inspection. From Mexico cartel safe house to US streets: BBC tracks deadly fentanyl targeted by Trump tariffs Mexico cartels: Which are the biggest and most powerful? For many, however, the worst part of the gruesome discovery is that local police raided the ranch, near the village of TeuchitlÃ¡n, as recently as last September.  While at the time they made 10 arrests and released two hostages, they either didn't find or didn't reveal any evidence of the apparent magnitude of violence carried out there. While the full picture is still to come over what action, if any, was taken by the municipal and state authorities after last year's operation, critics and victims' families openly accuse them of complicity with the cartels in Jalisco. State Governor Pablo Lemus responded in a video message. His administration was cooperating fully with the federal authorities, he said, and insisted that \"no one in Jalisco is washing their hands\" of the case. Shoes and other belongings have been found at the site of three alleged clandestine crematoriums  For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the events in Jalisco threaten to overshadow a strong start to her presidency.  Given the serious doubts about the actions of the local police and the state attorney general's office, she has ordered federal investigators to take charge of the case. She urged people not to jump to conclusions while the investigation is ongoing. \"It is important is to make the investigation before we come to any conclusions,\" she said in her morning press briefing earlier this week. \"What did they find at the site? Before anything else, we must hear from the attorney general's office, which is the agency responsible, and they will let the entire country know what they have found.\" Whether most Mexicans will believe the official version of events, however, is another question. Aerial view of the Izaguirre Ranch where three human crematoriums were located The place is now crawling with police officers, federal investigators and forensics teams in dust overalls.  Whatever they conclude, though, the media in Mexico is calling the Izaguirre Ranch an \"extermination\" site. Meanwhile, more search teams of victims' relatives have come to the state capital, Guadalajara, ahead of a protest march this weekend to urge the authorities to do more to find Mexico's missing people. Rosario MagaÃ±a was among them. She is the mother of Carlos Amador MagaÃ±a, who disappeared in June 2017. He was just 19 years old. Rosario MagaÃ±a holding a picture of her son and his best friend who were kidnapped together by the cartels \"I still feel desperate, as it's been eight years and I'm still in the same situation,\" she said - speaking of her endless search for her son who was kidnapped along with his best friend. \"It's a very, very slow process when it comes to the state attorney general's office and the investigation.\" \"I still have faith and hope of finding him,\" she stressed. \"But I'm in a situation which doesn't move forward, and it's discouraging.\" As she left a church service for the unknown victims at the ranch in TeuchitlÃ¡n, Rosario said the allegations of mistakes, oversight, collusion and negligence in the case only underlined the uphill struggle mothers like her have faced for years in obtaining answers to the most basic of questions about their children's whereabouts. \"There are so many mass graves in Jalisco, so many cartel safehouses, the authorities know the CJNG's modus operandi. So, what is the government doing?\" she asks rhetorically.

        "title": "Will scrapping NHS England help improve patient safety?",
        "content": "After Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's announcement this week that NHS England (NHSE) is to be disbanded, the BBC looks at whether the changes present a new opportunity to improve patient safety within the NHS. A hospital chief executive once described NHSE as \"the biggest kiss up, kick down, organisation in public life.\"  The comment came to mind when Health Secretary Wes Streeting on Thursday said the scrapping of NHSE would \"end the infantilisation of frontline NHS leaders.\" Time and again, NHS trusts have complained about the total control that NHSE, the body responsible for the day-to-day running of the health service in the country, exerted over their actions â the lack of freedom they had to either showcase their good work or respond to particular challenges.  \"You won't find many who shed a tear over its demise,\" said one NHS official, \"but there is concern as to what the re-organisation will mean for patient care.\" But for many patients who have been failed by the NHS, there is a feeling that it was always more a part of the problem than the solution. Protecting the reputation of the NHS brand often seemed to matter more than doing the right thing. Rarely has a major patient safety failure been uncovered and proactively admitted by NHSE. Many of the patient safety scandals that I have covered â the deaths of people with learning disabilities and mental health problems at Southern Health, maternity failures in Shrewsbury and Telford, East Kent and Nottingham â were only revealed after the skilled and active campaigning of grieving and committed families, who felt compelled to turn to the media when other efforts had failed. Consider, for instance, the poor care that mothers and babies received at the East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust. An independent review of its maternity services, published in 2022, found that between 2009 and 2020, at least 45 babies might have survived with better care. The scandal was only uncovered by the tenacity of the Richford family, who lost baby Harry in 2017 following a series of avoidable errors. NHS England: Why world's biggest quango is being axed What does NHS England do? Your questions answered on health reforms But the inquiry revealed NHS England had been aware since 2013 that there were concerns about maternity services. Despite this, \"the safety structures within NHSE did not see the trust as being a problem,\" said the review.   Various efforts were made by NHSE to help the trust but they \"failed to secure the necessary improvements in the services provided,\" and so babies continued to die unnecessarily. NHS England's answer to the persistence of the problem, found the inquiry, was \"a pattern of hiring and firing, initiated by NHSE.  It is clear that this approach was not just ineffective in East Kent, but wholly counterproductive. These decisions appear to us to have been made separately from any question of accountability.\" Helen Gittos, who lost her daughter Harriet in 2014 at East Kent, is glad that NHSE is being scrapped.   \"When families met with Wes Streeting to talk about maternity safety in the autumn, one of our messages was that NHSE was part of the problem, not part of the solution.  \"It has been incredibly frustrating to see NHSE's response to successive reviews of maternity services. It's almost as if they haven't read the reports\", she said.  The Maternity Safety Improvement Programme, led by NHSE, has not brought the kind of improvements \"women and families so desperately need\", she added. An NHS England spokesperson said: \"Our staff work exceptionally hard to keep patients safe and we have made significant progress in this area through the implementation of the first ever NHS Patient Safety Strategy, which introduced an NHS-wide programme of training and education in patient safety. \"This strategy, which evolves over time to ensure it meets current challenges, has transformed the governance of safety across the NHS.\" NHS England has published hundreds of independent investigations, at a cost of millions of pounds, into the care and treatment that patients have received.  Many of these have been welcomed by the families, providing necessary answers. Individual staff have been commended for their engagement with families, too.  But on too many occasions, it has proved an almighty struggle for them to act. At the heart of many of the patient safety scandals uncovered in recent years has been a poor culture, an unwillingness to openly engage with patients. At the root of those problems has been poor behaviour in particular trusts, but repeatedly, families have complained that NHSE's own secrecy has added to the problem.  While individual NHS trusts regularly publish their board papers well ahead of meetings, for years NHSE itself didn't publish any board papers until the meeting was over â proof, said critics, of its lack of openness to scrutiny.  Its papers are now published â about two hours before a meeting. Amanda Pritchard (left) suddenly quit as the head of NHS England a few weeks ago \"Their organisational culture is very much 'we are the NHS, this is how we do things,' said Peter Walsh, a long-term patient safety campaigner.   \"There are certainly some well-meaning people within the organisation, people of integrity, but too often, they have never really seen it as their role to stand up for patients.\" Mr Walsh points to a recommendation from the review into maternity failures at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust. The report called for the creation of independent advocates to ensure women and their families were listened to.   NHS England tried to reinvent the role, said Mr Walsh, to make the advocates its employees.   \"The very fact they were dead set on employing these independent advocates themselves says something about the culture - its control, and just not even beginning to understand the nature of independence.\" Whether the abolition of NHS England does lead to a greater focus on patient safety is uncertain.   The NHS used to have a world-leading organisation, the National Patient Safety Agency, which wasn't perfect but was admired globally for its sole focus on improving patient outcomes.  It was abolished in 2012 and subsumed into NHS England.   \"In the short term, the reorganisation could set back patient safety,\" said Paul Whiting, chief executive of the charity Action against Medical Accidents.   \"But in the long term, patient safety must be put at the heart of the government's 10-year plan for the NHS, to win back trust,\" he added. \"I wouldn't put NHS England as an organisation to be any worse than what we've had before or may actually get in the future,\" said Professor James Walker, who was the first clinical director for maternity care at the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch, which examined cases of poor neonatal and maternal care. The upcoming change, however, is \"a big opportunity to improve patient safety, but we need a mental shift.   \"Throughout the whole of the health service, we've totally lost empathy for the patient. We've become very regimented â we need to focus on how we can help, rather than whether someone fits into a framework of how the NHS delivers care.\" Chris Mason on why scrapping NHS England matters We aborted healthy babies after NHS mistakes, couples tell BBC âI just want to feel ordinaryâ â Is the mental health system failing teens?

        "title": "Snag clothing gets 100 complaints a day that models are too fat, says boss",
        "content": "Sophie models for Snag and gets positive and negative comments about her weight Listen to Jennifer read this article  The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are \"too fat\". Chief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of \"hateful\" posts about their weight. The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned. The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin. But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag. Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\". Adverts should not normalise being extremely under or overweight, says Catherine The 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme. Mrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant. \"I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,\" she says.  \"How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\" But Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\" She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\". Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\". \"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says. \"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\" Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media. Sophie says if she helps one person to accept their body then the hateful comments don't bother her \"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\" Sophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels. \"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'. \"When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get. \"If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me.\" This Next advert was banned as the shot and angle made the model appear too thin Fashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the \"depressing\" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns. \"You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,\" she says. \"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'.

She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated. \"It's to do with the wider societal context.

        "title": "SpaceX rocket launches as stranded Nasa astronauts prepare to return from ISS",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Smiles and hugs as new crew arrives on ISS A SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew has docked at the International Space Station (ISS), paving the way for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to come home. The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they arrived on, they have been there for more than nine months. The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth later this week. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect. \"Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,\" he said. Watch: How two astronauts were left in space for nine months Nasa astronauts Butch and Suni's homecoming delayed again Why are the Boeing Starliner astronauts still in space? Live footage showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the ISS and opening a hatch. Shortly after 0545 GMT, the astronauts embraced and hugged their counterparts. The astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US. There will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme. \"Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,\" she told reporters. Ms Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week. \"Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,\" she said. The astronauts all embraced and hugged their counterparts Suni Williams describes being in space as her \"happy place\" The astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her \"happy place\". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost. \"When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,\" he said. \"This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval.\" Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX.  The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system. Astronauts Suni Williams (left) and Butch Wilmore were supposed to have stayed on the space station for eight days Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months. Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber. \"It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft.\" Artwork: five of Starliner's Maneuvering thrusters stalled while docking on to the ISS Both President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February, external. President Trump states: \"They got left in space.\" When the interviewer,  Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying \"They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,\" Mr Trump responds with one word: \"Biden.\" Mr Musk follows up asserting: \"They were left up there for political reasons.\" The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch. \"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said. That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS. \"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said. \"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe. \"I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.\" Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "'For holding a wombat, thousands threatened my life' - Sam Jones",
        "content": "This video can not be played  A US influencer who was filmed taking a wild baby wombat away from its distressed mother in Australia has said she is \"truly sorry\" and received thousands of death threats over the incident. Sam Jones, who calls herself an \"outdoor enthusiast and hunter\", was filmed picking up the joey on the side of a road, while laughing and running over to a car, while the mother chases after them. It sparked a huge backlash, with Australian PM Anthony Albanese challenging her to \"take a baby crocodile from its mother and see how you go there\". In a lengthy statement on her Instagram page, external, Jones says she was trying to get the animals safely off the road. She said, as can be seen in the video, that the mother runs off the road, but the baby does not, and Jones scoops it up. She says she ran across the road \"not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear she might attack me\". \"The snap judgement I made in these moments was never from a place of harm or stealing a joey,\" the statement said. She said the video was \"not staged, nor was it done for entertainment\", and in her excitement of the moment, \"acted too quickly and failed to provide necessary context to viewers online\". US influencer draws backlash for stealing baby wombat from mum In the second part of her statement, Jones launched a scathing attack on Australia's animal culling laws, including wombats, kangaroos, horses, deer and pigs. Australia has various culling laws and regulations that spark controversy and divide the nation. Wombats, which are native to Australia, are a protected species, but permits can be obtained to cull them if deemed necessary. To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital An online petition supporting her deportation received more than 40,000 signatures. Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said his department was reviewing whether it could revoke Jones's visa. However, the BBC understands that she left the country of her own accord. Jones, who also goes by the name Samantha Strable, has more than 95,000 followers on Instagram.  Conservationists warned Jones's \"appalling\" behaviour could have caused severe harm to the wombats. The Wombat Protection Society said it was shocked to see the \"mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for 'social media likes'\". \"[She] then placed the vulnerable baby back onto a country road - potentially putting it at risk of becoming roadkill,\" it noted in its statement, adding that it remained unclear if the joey had been reunited with its mother. \"I caught a baby wombat,\" Jones said in the video, while the joey could be heard hissing and struggling in her grip. The man filming can be heard laughing: \"Look at the mother, it's chasing after her!\"  Her caption in the now-deleted post read: \"My dream of holding a wombat has been realised! Baby and mom slowly waddled back off together into the bush.\" \"The baby was carefully held for one minute in total and then released back to mom,\" she wrote in the comments, responding to criticism. \"They wandered back off into the bush together completely unharmed. I don't ever capture wildlife that will be harmed by my doing so.\" Animal rights organisations have criticised Jones. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or Peta, described the video as \"wildlife-exploiting content\" and urged people to \"stop treating wildlife as a prop\".

        "content": "The Solong cargo ship after it collided with an oil tanker in the North Sea The captain of a cargo ship that collided with an oil tanker in the North Sea has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter. Vladimir Motin, 59, of Primorsky, St Petersburg, Russia, has been remanded in police custody to appear at Hull Magistrates' Court on Saturday, Humberside Police said. The Portuguese-flagged Solong and US-registered tanker Stena Immaculate crashed off the East Yorkshire coast at about 10:00 GMT on Monday. Filipino national Mark Angelo Pernia, 38, has been named as the crew member of the Solong who is missing and presumed dead, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Frank Ferguson, head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said: \"We have authorised Humberside Police to charge a Russian national in relation to a collision involving two vessels in the North Sea off the east coast of England.\" Mr Ferguson added: \"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial. \"It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.\" The Stena Immaculate was carrying 220,000 barrels of aviation fuel at the time of the crash The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) is trying to establish the cause of the crash. It said initial inquiries found the Solong was travelling from Grangemouth to Rotterdam and had often sailed the same route. \"At 09:47 GMT it struck the Stena Immaculate that was at anchor off the entrance to the River Humber,\" the MAIB said. On Friday, Stena Bulk said salvage experts from SMIT Salvage had successfully boarded Stena Immaculate to conduct a thorough assessment. It said the salvage process was \"necessarily methodical, comprehensive and ongoing\" and would \"require time to complete fully\". Chief coastguard Paddy O'Callaghan said \"only small periodic pockets of fire\" on Solong remained, which were \"not causing undue concern\". He added regular aerial surveillance flights continued to monitor the vessels and confirmed \"there continues to be no cause for concern from pollution\" from either ship. All 23 crew on board Stena Immaculate were Americans who are currently in Grimsby and are likely to be repatriated in due course, the BBC understands.

        "title": "Trump revoking legal status for 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans",
        "content": "Migrants from Venezuela viewing a map of the US at a Welcome Center in El Paso, Texas in 2022 US President Donald Trump's administration has said it will revoke the temporary legal status of more than half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Those migrants have been warned to leave the country before their permits and deportation shield are cancelled on 24 April, according to a notice posted by the federal government. The 530,000 migrants were brought into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process known as CHNV that was designed to open legal migration pathways. Trump suspended the programme once he took office. It is unclear how many of these migrants have been able to secure another status in the interim that would allow them to stay in the US legally. The programme was launched under Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, first covering Venezuelans before it was expanded to other countries.  Judge in migrants deportations case says government lawyers 'disrespectful' It allowed the migrants and their immediate family members to fly into the US if they had American sponsors and remain for two years under a temporary immigration status known as parole. The Biden administration had argued that CHNV would help curb illegal crossings at the southern US border and allow for better vetting of those entering the country.  The Department of Homeland Security on Friday rebuked the prior administration and said the programme had failed in its goals.  The agency's statement said Biden officials had \"granted them [migrants] opportunities to compete for American jobs and undercut American workers; forced career civil servants to promote the programs even when fraud was identified; and then blamed Republicans in Congress for the chaos that ensued and the crime that followed\". However, the 35-page notice in the Federal Register said some of those in the US under CHNV might be allowed to remain on a \"case-by-case basis\".  Karen Tumlin, founder of the Justice Action Center in California, said her organisation is set to challenge the move in court. She told the BBC the decision hurt people \"who did everything right that the US Government asked of them\", adding that \"their sponsors in the United States paid the fees, filled out the government paperwork, waited in line\". \"To say 'oh, we're so sorry, even if you had 18 months left on your grant of permission to be here we're going to pull the rug out from under you in the next 30 days,' it's really quite surprising.\" Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it? 'Oopsie, too late' - US courts tested by Trump's latest deportations Trump is also considering whether to cancel the temporary legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. CHNV helped a reported 213,000 Haitians enter the US amid deteriorating conditions in the Caribbean country. More than 120,700 Venezuelans, 110,900 Cubans and over 93,000 Nicaraguans were also allowed into the US under the programme before Trump shut it down. Last month, DHS announced it would in August end another immigration designation, temporary protected status (TPS), for 500,000 Haitians living in the US.  TPS was granted to nationals of designated countries facing unsafe conditions, such as armed conflict or environmental disasters.  DHS also halted TPS for Venezuelans in the US, although this is facing a legal challenge. Since taking office in January, Trump's immigration policies have encountered a number of legal hurdles.

        "title": "Adolescence writer wants 'radical action not role models'",
        "content": "Owen Cooper has been praised for his performance as 13-year-old Jamie One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows, external to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school. Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer. \"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying. \"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds. \"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\" Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises. Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities. Adolescence co-writer Jack Thorne also penned another recent Netflix hit, Toxic Town But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC. \"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\" His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways. But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence. \"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says. \"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\" Christine Tremarco and Stephen Graham play Jamie's parents The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes. He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places. \"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says. \"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you. \"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\" This video can not be played Watch: Co-writer of Adolescence Jack Thorne speaks to Newsnight about the threat of incel culture These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men. On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\". \"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said. Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models. \"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models. \"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture. \"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\" So what could more radical solutions be? Police detectives played by Ashley Walters and Faye Marsay visit Jamie's school to seek information This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children. Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons. Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\". \"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says. He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media. The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming. \"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says. A ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though. Each episode was filmed in a single shot, including one showing a session between Jamie and a child psychologist played by Erin Doherty Thorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21. When asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings. One said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\". For Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home. His son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone. While working on the series, he has been thinking about how to handle his son's future use of technology. \"And I'm still processing how to do it.\" Researching and writing Adolescence has opened his eyes about the challenges facing young people and parents, he says.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch the moment Jamie Laing completes his challenge BBC Radio 1 presenter Jamie Laing has completed his Comic Relief Ultra Marathon Man challenge - raising more than Â£2m for the charity. The former Made in Chelsea star ran five consecutive ultra marathons in five days - 150 miles (241km) in total  - from London to Salford, where he crossed the finish line on Friday. He thanked everyone \"who's donated, who's supported, who's sent me messages\" adding: \"That was a wild ride everyone. That was intense at times. That was emotional. I've never cried more in my life.\" Laing, who claimed to have never run more than 5km (3.1 miles) before taking on the challenge, was met by wife Sophie Habboo and Radio 1 DJs Greg James, Vick Hope and Jeremiah Asiamah. Laing said: \"At one point I thought I was down and out. Mentally I was gone, physically I was broken. I didn't have anything left in me. \"Something pulled me out. The last kilometre was the most euphoric thing I've ever had.\" The final total raised was Â£2,053,835. It comes as Red Nose Day celebrates 40 years of comedy and entertainment this year, marking the occasion with a night of live TV on Friday. Laing described how running five ultra marathons in five days had changed him. \"It's made me more vulnerable, thankful, grateful,\" he said. \"It's made me realise humans are amazing and that life is beautiful.\" The moment Jamie Laing crossed the finish line in Salford Radio 1's Greg James joined Jamie's final day of his marathon challenge, in, er, questionable running attire Setting off from BBC Broadcasting House in London on 17 March, Laing waved a giant green flag at the starting line, with a crowd of cheering supporters. He was met by 50 lookalikes in Hyde Park, all donning blonde Jamie Laing wigs. On day three after setting off from Market Harborough, Laing told Radio 1 listeners he feared he might \"quit\". But he went on to say: \"I have to get through thisâ¦ I am just running, it's only temporary.\" After listeners helped raise Â£450,000 for Comic Relief, Greg James agreed to run alongside Jamie in a wedding dress on the final day. Before Jamie found out he'd raised over half a million on Wednesday, he was actually being sick on the side of a road During the challenge, listeners praised Laing for speaking honestly about his previous mental health struggles. He opened up about living with anxiety in his twenties, saying: \"I didn't know who to turn to,\" adding: \"I'm running to raise money for people who are affected with loneliness, anxiety, depression, OCD, insomnia, whatever it may be.\" Fellow presenter Asiamah described Laing as \"an example for so many men out there\", praising his ability to persevere with the challenge. On crossing the finish line, Laing reiterated the importance of speaking openly about mental health. \"It's way braver to talk about it than not talk about it,\" he said. \"This week has made me realise that talking about things is the coolest thing in the world.\" \"Being vulnerable is the greatest thing in the world. Sing it from a rooftop.\" Comic Relief: Funny for Money, will be broadcast live from 19:00 GMT on BBC One and 22:00 GMT on BBC Two on Friday.

        "content": "Oleg Gordievsky has died at his home in Surrey aged 86, the BBC understands Oleg Gordievsky, the long-standing KGB double agent who defected to Britain, has died aged 86. Gordievsky was said to be Britain's most valuable spy in living memory inside Russia's intelligence agencies. Counter-terrorism police are assisting the coroner, but his death is not being treated as suspicious. He died peacefully at his home in Surrey, the BBC understands. Oleg Gordievsky in disguise in the Marlborough Hotel in London in 1990 Gordievsky, a colonel in Russia's KGB, spent many years as a double agent, passing vital intelligence to both Britain's MI6 and MI5. He has lived in Godalming under police protection since Moscow became suspicious of him in 1985 and he narrowly escaped arrest, trial and a firing squad by getting smuggled across the border into Finland in the boot of a car. Two years earlier, as the KGB resident in London at the height of the Cold War, he warned his British handlers that Moscow had become so paranoid about an imaginary surprise attack by the West that the Soviet Union began making preparations to strike first. As a result of his tip-off, NATO curtailed its military exercise codenamed Able Archer, and the crisis was averted. In 2007, Gordievsky was honoured by the Queen with the Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. The honour is the same title bestowed on fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Information passed on by Gordievsky led to the expulsion of 25 Soviet agents working undercover in the UK. At the time of his work as a double agent, his defection was hailed by then Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe as \"a very substantial coup for our security forces\". Gordievsky has since written a number of books about the operations of the KGB.

        "title": "Beauty and the Beast: New book sparks censorship row in France",
        "content": "Julien Berjeaut says the decision to pull the order was \"as if Trump and his team were in charge.\" The French government has been accused of censorship after it cancelled a book order for 800,000 copies of Beauty and the Beast,  which were to be given free to children this summer. According to Education Minister Ãlisabeth Borne, it is because the new illustrated version of the classic story was judged too grown-up for the 10 and 11 year-olds who would be reading it. But illustrator Julien Berjeaut â known as Jul â said the ministry's objections were spurious, and that he feared the book was pulled because the characters he portrayed in it were dark-skinned. \"The only reason I can think of [for the cancellation] is the disgust some people felt at seeing princes and princesses who look a bit more like actual schoolchildren of today,\" he told France's Le Monde newspaper. Jul believes the cancellation is because the characters in the new books have \"darker skin instead of blonde fairy-tale princesses.\" He added that it was \"as if [Donald] Trump and his team were in charge\". The original Beauty and the Beast was written by French authoress Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in the 18th century, and tells of a merchant's daughter, Belle, who must live with an ogre in order to save her father's life. Eventually â as viewers of the Disney film will know - Belle falls in love with the ogre and discovers he is in fact a prince. France ordered 800,000 copies of the new illustrated version of the book - and had to cancel it Jul â who is known for his affectionally grotesque caricatures â was commissioned to give a modern take on the tale, with the book being the latest in a programme of annual gifts to French pre-adolescents. In his illustrations (the text is the original), the merchant is a Mediterranean importer of illegal contraband and Belle's siblings are pampered teenagers gorging on social media. According to a spokesperson at the ministry quoted by Le Figaro, \"the illustrations address themes which are unsuitable for children of that age â alcohol, social media, illegal trading and police checks. \"The father is an Algerian who drinks and does dodgy import-export. He's even arrested by police. Without explanation, this was bound to provoke a reaction from parents.\" The free book programme, which was launched seven years ago, is meant to encourage children to read at home, without the supervision of teachers or parents. According to Borne, \"Jul has a lot of talent.  He's good at irony, at not taking things at face value.  But without accompaniment, [the book] is not adapted to the age-group.\" The ministry said there had been several meetings with Jul at which officials had raised concerns about the progress of the work, but he had failed to take account of their objections. Oddly, in the last proofs of the book before it was withdrawn, the minister had actually added a preface, praising Jul's \"malicious touch and razor-sharp eye.\" The book will still be published, but not at the ministry's expense. French children this year will instead receive a version of Homer's Odyssey.

        "title": "Katherine Ryan: Comedian diagnosed with skin cancer for second time",
        "content": "Katherine Ryan said her doctor told her the melanoma had been caught \"very early\" Comedian Katherine Ryan has said she has been diagnosed with skin cancer for a second time. Speaking on her podcast and social media, the Canadian star confirmed she had recently had a cancerous mole on her arm removed, and will have a further procedure next week to ensure it is all gone. The stand-up comic, 41, was first diagnosed with cancer in 2004 when she was a student in Toronto, having a \"golf ball-sized\" lump taken out of her thigh as a result. This time around, she said a doctor had initially dismissed her concerns, but tests showed that the mole was \"early melanoma\". \"If you know about melanoma, you'll know it is a deadly form of skin cancer. It does spread quickly, and I just felt like this mole wasn't right,\" she said. However, a doctor assured her the mole was not melanoma, she told listeners of her Telling Everybody Everything podcast. \"It's really easy to take a diagnosis of 'you're healthy' and just walk away... But the mole kept changing.\" She went back to the doctor, who still said it was \"totally fine\", but removed part of it for testing. The doctor then called her back and confirmed her suspicions were correct - it was melanoma. She said he told her it had been caught \"very early, so I highly doubt that it has spread\". She added: \"It just feels crazy to me, what could have happened, if I hadn't been my own advocate - and I will continue to be my own advocate.\" Ryan is a regular on UK TV programmes like Live at the Apollo, 8 Out of 10 Cats and her own Netflix show, The Duchess. She said \"the whole reason that I was reminded to go back\" to the doctor's was because she had seen Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi Mellencamp talking about her own melonoma. \"God bless that woman for being so transparent about her journey,\" she said. Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Teddi Mellencamp inspired Ryan to get herself checked Ryan said she has \"very fair Celtic skin\" so wears sun cream \"all the time\" and also covers up her body - which has \"over 100 moles\" - when she goes out in it. Her latest bout of cancer has left her wondering \"what other moles do I need to have checked?\" She also urged listeners to find the time to get themselves checked and to \"advocate\" for themselves with their health concerns. \"You have to make space in your day for these appointments,\" she said. Last year, Cancer Research UK warned people to do more to protect themselves from the sun as the number of melanoma skin cancer cases in the UK continues to rise. The charity predicted there would be a record 20,800 cases diagnosed in 2024 â up from a yearly average of 19,300 between 2020 and 2022. The rise in diagnoses is due partly to a growing ageing population and an increase in awareness of the signs of skin cancer. Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body. Melanomas are less common than non-melanoma skin cancers, but they are one of the most dangerous forms of skin cancer, according to the British Skin Foundation, external. They can develop from existing moles, but they more often appear as new marks on the skin, the charity says. This can appear anywhere on the body, but the most commonly affected areas are the back in men and the legs in women.

        "title": "Andrew and Tristan Tate say they left US to return to Romania",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: 'We deserve our day in court', Andrew Tate says British-American influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have returned from the US to Romania, where they face human trafficking and other charges. Speaking to the press outside their house in Bucharest, the brothers said they were back because \"innocent men don't run from anything.\" \"We've come here to prove our innocence because we deserve our day in court,\" Andrew Tate added. The BBC understands the brothers will appear at a police station to register on Monday. They strongly deny the allegations against them. Andrew Tate earlier told his 10.8 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 (Â£143,000) on a private jet alongside his brother to \"sign one single piece of paper in Romania.\" The brothers, who are dual US-UK citizens, arrived in the US at the end of February after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban. They told reporters they loved Romania and were \"never going to leave\" but would take holidays if and when they felt like it. Andrew Tate, 38, is a self-proclaimed \"misogynist\" who claims to have made millions from social media despite being previously banned from platforms for his views. He and Tristan, 36, are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. The brothers are also the subjects of a separate investigation in the UK into allegations of rape and human trafficking. In the US they face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. They deny the allegations against them. Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against the brothers had not been dropped and that they remain \"under judicial control\" - meaning they have to regularly report to the authorities. However, their exit sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from US President Donald Trump's administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. When asked about concerns surrounding US influence, the brothers rejected these claims. \"There's no American pressure, there's just the rule of law,\" the eldest brother told reporters. The Tates have a large US following and are popular figures among some elements of the American right. Earlier in February, some of Andrew Tate's alleged victims said they were \"extremely concerned\" by reports that US officials had asked for his travel restrictions to be relaxed. Andrew Tate was put under house arrest in Romania in August 2024 when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against him and his brother Tristan, as well as four other suspects. They all deny wrongdoing. Separately, the brothers are wanted in the UK to face allegations of sexual assault, which they also deny. The brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. A British court ruled in December 2024 that police could seize more than Â£2m ($2.6m) from them for failing to pay tax on Â£21m in revenue from their online businesses. Andrew Tate said the ruling was \"not justice\" and called it a \"co-ordinated attack\".

        "title": "Trump cancels executive order against law firm after $40m promise",
        "content": "Trump has signed dozens of executive orders since his return to the White House, often targeting critics President Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (Â£31m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives.  Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients.  Trump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system. The firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options. Trump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.  The White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton.  In a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\". It added that Paul Weiss would commit to \"merit-based\" hiring and promotion, and \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\". Trump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government. The Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\" Many in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a \"sad day for the legal industry\". Marc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky. \"Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,\" he wrote. \"This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.\" Soon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement. \"Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,\" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration. She had helped organise the open letter, external criticising the Trump administration for attempting to \"bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims\". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported. In an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported. The firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients. In the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing \"an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles\". It had cited \"a Paul Weiss partner\" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as \"J6ers\". It also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney  on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of  having committed a felony in the case. The order had also alleged that the firm \"discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws\".

        "title": "Heathrow substation fire: What went wrong?",
        "content": "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports. The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.  Disaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night. Banks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans.  \"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines. He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\". Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\". That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use. This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play. Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely. A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time. The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly. A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected. The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport. There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group. It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm. \"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\" However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports â Gatwick is the other â that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards. \"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said. In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025. It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.  \"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added. A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated. Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow. Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going. Additional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith. Update 22 March: This article has been corrected to amend a reference to the amount of trade goods affected by the closure of Heathrow. It was millions of pounds worth of trade goods, not millions of tonnes as we originally stated.

        "content": "Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is Namibia's first female president  Namibia's new president was sworn in on Friday to lead a country facing high rates of unemployment, inequality and poverty.  And she will be dealing with it with the additional burden of being only Africa's second-ever directly elected female president and Namibia's first female head of state.  \"If things go well then it will be seen as a good example,\" Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told BBC's Africa Daily podcast. \"But if anything then happens, like it can happen in any administration under men, there are also those who would rather say: 'Look at women!'\"  The 72-year-old won November's election with a 58% share of the vote. Nandi-Ndaitwah has been a long-term loyalist of the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) â which has been in power since the country gained independence in 1990 after a long struggle against apartheid South Africa. She joined Swapo, then a liberation movement resisting South Africa's white-minority rule, when she was only 14. While the party has made changes and improved the lives of the black majority, the legacy of apartheid can still be seen in patterns of wealth and land ownership.  \"Truly, land is a serious problem in this country,\" she told the BBC ahead of the inauguration.  \"We still have some white citizens and more particularly the absent land owners who are occupying the land.\" From freedom fighter to Namibia's first female president LISTEN: Africa Daily's interview with Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah She adds that she is committed to the \"willing-buyer, willing-seller\" principle, which means no-one is forced to sell up.  Namibia is a geographically large country with a small population of three million.  Government statistics show that white farmers own about 70% of the country's farmland. A total of  53,773 Namibians identified as white in the 2023 census, external, representing 1.8% of the country's population.  Namibia is one of the world's most unequal countries, with a Gini coefficient of 59.1 in 2015, according to the World Bank, external, which projects poverty is expected to remain high at 17.2% in 2024.  The unemployment rate rose to 36.9% in 2023 from 33.4% in 2018, according to the country's statistics agency., external Nandi-Ndaitwah said the economy, which partly relies on mineral exports, should work more on adding value to what the country extracts from the ground rather than exporting raw materials. She also wants Namibia to focus more on creative industries and get the education sector to adjust to new economic realities. Nandi-Ndaitwah is only the second African woman to be directly elected as president, after Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The continent's only other female president at the moment is Tanzania's Samia Suluhu Hassan, who took up the role after her predecessor died in office in 2021. Nandi-Ndaitwah wants to be judged on her merits, but she said that it was a \"good thing that we as countries are realising that just as men [can do], women can also hold the position of authority\".

        "title": "Heathrow closure: What are my rights?",
        "content": "Some flights at Heathrow have resumed after the airport was shut on Friday due to a fire at a nearby electrical substation that supplies it with power. The UK's busiest airport has warned of significant disruption over the coming days, with at least 1,300 flights in and out cancelled. What are your rights if your journey has been disrupted and can you get your money back? Do not attempt to travel to the airport, but keep in touch with your airline who will be able to advise you about refunds or booking alternative flights. If your flight is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight. You can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used. So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. If you accept a refund, your airline has no further duty of care to you. If you need to make any other arrangements, you will need to do so yourself. If you still wish to travel, your airline is obliged to get you on a new flight as soon as possible, including with rival carriers from alternative airports. Bear in mind though, with so many flights cancelled, other airports will be stretched as well. If there are other suitable modes of transport, such as the train for domestic journeys, then you have a right to be booked on to that alternative transport instead. If your flight was coming into Heathrow on a non-UK airline, then you should check the terms and conditions of your booking. Follow live updates: Heathrow shutdown leaves thousands stranded What we know so far If you are stuck abroad or at the airport, your airline is obliged to offer you further assistance, including: free accommodation, if you have to stay overnight to fly the next day transport to and from the accommodation a reasonable amount of food and drink (often in the form of vouchers) a way for you to communicate (often by refunding the cost of calls) If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. The Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. In this instance you will not be entitled to extra compensation from your airline as the situation will be deemed an \"extraordinary circumstance\" beyond the airline's control. If your travel insurance policy includes trip disruption, you should be covered if you have to cancel your travel plans.  The Association of British Insurers advises you to check your policy details and speak to your insurer if you're not sure what is included. You may be able to recoup other expenses such as car hire or airport parking fees. Any bookings made through a credit card may also have recoverable costs.  If you booked a package holiday with a company that is a member of ABTA, the association of travel agents and tour operators, and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. In this situation, your airline would usually try to keep passengers on the plane, or failing that set up a holding area in the airport terminal that doesn't require you to enter the country. If the delay is long enough that passengers cannot be held in the terminal before immigration, they would usually be bussed to a nearby hotel. Typically they wouldn't be asked to pay for any visa that is issued, such as a port visa or a visa on arrival, according to the consumer group Which?. However, you should be particularly mindful if your flight cancellation means you end up overstaying somewhere on an existing visa.  Which? warns that, especially in places like the US and China, you should contact local immigration officials and ask for an emergency extension. Heathrow says it hopes to run a full operation on Saturday, but it has warned customers to expect \"significant disruption over the coming days\". Keep in touch with your airline for further information. The disruption is likely to affect other airports as well as flights are being diverted. When heavy snow closed Heathrow's runways for a day in December 2010, it resulted in more than 4,000 flights being cancelled over five days. You are entitled to the same assistance at the airport as for a cancellation if your flight is delayed by more than: two hours for a short-haul flight three hours for a medium-haul flight four hours for a long-haul flight. If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.

        "content": "Marcin Majerkiewicz put Mr Everett's body parts in bags and took bus journeys across Greater Manchester to dump the evidence. A man has been found guilty of murdering and dismembering his housemate into 27 pieces and dumping his body parts across a city.  Marcin Majerkiewicz, who had an \"obsession with gore and gruesome horror\", killed Stuart Everett, 67, with a hammer-type weapon before cutting his body up with a hacksaw. Some of Mr Everett's remains were first discovered by a member of the public in an abandoned bunker at a nature reserve in Salford in April last year. Majerkiewicz, 42, had denied murdering him between 27 and 28 March but he was convicted by a jury at Manchester Crown Court. Warning: This story contains distressing details Mr Everett's brother Richard Ziemacki said his family had been \"haunted\" by the murder of their \"endearing and loving\" relative, who they affectionately called Benny. A murder investigation began after Mr Everett's torso was found wrapped in cling-film at Kersal Dale nature reserve on 4 April. Majerkiewicz had put his body parts in bags and took bus journeys across Salford and Manchester to dump the evidence. He was seen on CCTV struggling to carry a heavy bag on Bury New Road in Prestwich and then dumping it. Mr Everett lived with Majerkiewicz in Winton, Salford Police did not know the identity of the man in the footage but three weeks later Majerkiewicz was spotted by an officer who drove past him by chance and noted he looked like the man from the CCTV. Mr Everett's remains were also found at Linnyshaw Colliery Woods, Boggart Hole Clough, Blackleach Reservoir, Worsley Woods and Chesterfield Close. The trial heard only a third of his body had been recovered. Mr Everett, originally from Derby and born Roman Ziemacki to Polish parents, and Majerkiewicz, from Poland, lived together with another man in his house in Winton, Salford. Mr Everett first met his killer while teaching English to recently arrived Polish immigrants and Majerkiewicz moved in during 2017, the trial was told.  A rectangular piece of carpet had been cut out and replaced with another piece in the home A forensic examination found blood on the carpet, wall and chest of drawers in Majerkiewicz's bedroom and evidence of a clean-up.  Majerkiewicz had used a professional rug cleaner but when he could not clean blood off a section of the carpet he had cut a rectangular piece from Mr Everett's room to replace it and covered it with a bed, Greater Manchester Police said. The force said the nails used to secure the replacement carpet contained Majerkiewicz's DNA, proving he was responsible for concealing the crime scene. The original carpet, covered in blood matching Mr Everett's DNA, was recovered in a skip outside the house. Majerkiewicz disposed of Mr Everett's remains at secluded areas in Salford and Manchester, including Blackleach Reservoir GMP said in the days after the murder Majerkiewicz had called a \"white van man\" to help take furniture from the house to a lock-up in Bury, including a sofa bed and a fridge freezer. Mr Everett's blood was found on the sofa bed, which is believed to be where his life was taken. The fridge freezer also contained his DNA. Detectives were able to find other body parts in remote locations after examining his mobile phone.  A forensic pathologist said Mr Everett was killed with a hammer-type weapon and had several blunt force trauma injuries to the head.  Majerkiewicz called a \"white van man\" for help in removing furniture from the property including a sofa bed where it is believed he killed Mr Everett Mr Everett's family initially had no idea he had died. Majerkiewicz had taken over his finances and his mobile phone. He even sent text messages and a birthday card to his family purporting to be from Mr Everett. Speaking after the conviction, Mr Ziemacki said: \"For any person to be treated the way [my brother] was - brutally murdered and systematically and comprehensively disposed of has meant our family are traumatised beyond belief.\" Majerkiewicz had been searching online for properties to rent in the Alicante area of Spain before his arrest. The court heard he had worked as a manager at fast-food shops in the Trafford Centre but was unemployed at the time of the murder and had debts of about Â£60,000.   Majerkiewicz had an obsession with gore and gruesome horror and a tattoo of slasher-film character Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, Greater Manchester Police said. Det Ch Supt Lewis Hughes said he had a \"fixation with horror and gore\" but the team had \"not confirmed any clear motive\", adding: \"These are all relevant factors in what may have been going on, financial issues, debt, problems paying the bills, potentially a relationship between the two of them.\"  Majerkiewicz assumed Mr Everett's identity and sent his family messages and even birthday cards to make them believe he was still alive Rebecca Macaulay-Addison, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Marcin Majerkiewicz murdered Stuart Everett before making a despicable and disturbing attempt to cover his tracks by disposing of Mr Everett's remains. \"He went on to concoct a web of lies to further conceal his barbaric crime.\" Jurors convicted him of murder in under two hours of deliberations following a three-week trial at Manchester Crown Court. Trial judge Mr Justice Cavanagh told Majerkiewicz he faced a mandatory life sentence but he must set the minimum time before parole, which would happen on 28 March.

She then gave birth to his child when he was 16 years old and she was 23.  \"It's been 36 years, a lot of things change in that time and I would definitely have dealt with these issues differently today,\" the 58-year-old told Icelandic media, external. Iceland's Prime Minister KristrÃºn FrostadÃ³ttir told the press this was \"a serious matter\", although she said she knew little more than \"the average person\". \"This is a very personal matter [and] out of respect for the person concerned, I will not comment on the substance,\" she said. According to Visir newspaper, external, FrostadÃ³ttir said she had only received confirmation of the story on Thursday night. She immediately summoned the ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir to her office, where she resigned.  Allow X content? This article contains content provided by X.

Icelandic news agency RUV broke the story, external on Thursday night.  ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir revealed in an interview with them that she had met the father, who RUV name as EirÃ­k Ãsmundsson, while she was working at the religious group TrÃº og lÃ­f (Religion and Life), which he had reportedly joined because of a difficult home life.  He was 15 years old and she was 22 at the time of their meeting. ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir gave birth to their son when they were both a year older.  RUV report that the relationship was secret, but that Ãsmundsson was present at his child's birth and spent the first year with him.  However, the news agency writes this changed when ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir met her current husband.  They report they have seen documents Ãsmundsson submitted to Iceland's justice ministry requesting access to his son, but that ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir denied it, while also requesting - and receiving - child support payments from him over the following 18 years. A relative of Ãsmundsson tried twice to contact the Icelandic prime minister about the relationship last week.  FrostadÃ³ttir said last night that when the woman revealed it involved a government minister she asked for more information, which led to the revelation and the resignation.  In her TV interview with RUV last night, ThÃ³rsdÃ³ttir said she was upset that the woman had contacted the prime minister.  \"I understand... what it looks like,\" she said, adding that it is \"very difficult to get the right story across in the news today\".  While the age of consent in Iceland is 15, it is illegal to have sex with a person under the age of 18 if you are their teacher or mentor, if they are financially dependent on you, or work for you. The maximum sentence for this crime is three years in jail.  Despite resigning from her ministerial job, ThÃ³rsdottir said she had no plans to leave parliament.

        "content": "We've been hearing your memories of lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic, almost five years since the UK was told to stay at home From banana bread baking, to empty streets, and heart-wrenching virtual goodbyes to loved ones, the Your Voice, Your BBC News team collected your reflections  Student paramedic, James Lidington, said \"masks couldn't hide our exhaustion\" when he was thrust onto the NHS frontline during the pandemic. \"It was a baptism of fire, but it shaped me,\" he added Meanwhile, Ryan Cawley told the BBC about the enduring impact of long Covid, which has impacted his job and social life The UK locked down on 23 March 2020. Almost 227,000 people died in the UK from the virus Edited by Rorey Bosotti Cachella SmithLive reporter Support bubbles, PPE, social distancing, flattening the curve - phrases most of us hadn't heard of at the start of 2020 but which abruptly became part of our daily vocabulary.  We're almost five years on from the moment former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued the order to \"stay at home\".  To mark the upcoming anniversary, you brought the stories to us. You told us what it was like to miss a loved one's funeral, to work as a key worker in healthcare and to try to manage the symptoms of long Covid.  We also heard about unusual birthday celebrations, virtual cruise trips and indoor camping.  For many however the experience is not over, as research continues into possible treatments for long Covid and the public inquiry into the government's response progresses.  One of our contributors, Hannah Brady, lost her Dad to Covid in May 2020. Although the lockdown was tough she told us she'd do it all again to save lives.  \"We would go through the loneliness and pain of lockdown again in a heartbeat to save someone like Dad.\" We'll bring this page to a close shortly - thank you for sticking with us today and thank you for sharing your stories. Grace DeanBBC News John Scott's wife and four children during lockdown Descending back upon the family home was a common phenomenon for many during the period of restrictions.  John Scott, 62, from Solihull, had his four adult children return home - he calls the time \"very special\", adding that it helped restore relationships. Without lockdown he would have never had his four children, then in their 20s, all back living at home together, he says. Mike Halsall, 61, from Tunbridge Wells similarly had a busier household when his four children returned \"from various universities\".  \"Wouldn't have missed it for the world,\" he says.  For Peter Gaston, 42,  from Lisburn, his family still have \"lockdown days\" - mimicking the time when they \"shared more, laughed more, walked more [...] loved more without all the distractions of daily life\".  Meanwhile, Nik Barratt, 56, from Leicester, recalls enjoying beers across the driveways with his neighbours every Saturday afternoon for 65 consecutive weeks, \"regardless of the weather\" - sometimes with umbrellas or torches. They even made a pub sign on a chalkboard hanging from a neighbour's tree and had fun coming up with names.  Nik Barratt's neighbours had drinks on the driveway every Saturday, come rain or shine Grace DeanBBC News Kay (R) went into lockdown with her husband (L) and their daughter (C) For Kay Tucker, 62, from Horsham, lockdown was beset by tragedy.  Five members of her family died in the span of five months in late 2020 and early 2021, including her mother, who had Alzheimerâs, and her husband, who was in hospital with lymphoma. âWe had to wear PPE as we switched off his life supportâ, she says. Kay had to organise both funerals, which she described as a âgrotesque jokeâ. When your spouse dies, she says, âyour absolute universe is turned upside down\". âIt is completely and utterly horrific,â she continues. âI did become suicidalâ¦ I just wanted to be with my husband.â Kay says that she had trauma counselling and got help from members of her church community, who brought meals to her door for six weeks.  She also got support from charities like Care For The Family, which still supports her now, four years later, and sheâs in a WhatsApp group with five other widows who still exchange messages every day. Kris Bramwell âDuring lockdown I had to teach from home on Zoom,â 63-year-old maths teacher Eric Tame from Hull says. Despite having never heard of Zoom before lockdown, Eric says he soon got to grips with it, and it wasn't long until the rock n' roll bug took over.  \"While teaching I kept looking at this guitar I had which I hadn't played for 20 years. Eventually I picked it up and wrote a song called Lockdown Blues, which my pupils loved.\"  Since then Eric has written three albums, and released them on streaming service Spotify.  He says that he found teaching from  home very stressful but is grateful \"it pushed me to start playing my guitar again, a hobby I really enjoy.\" \"One day I may write a hit song,\" he confidentially tells us. Grace DeanBBC News An extract from Sarah's daughter's diary Sarah Wood, 48, from Derby, had been diagnosed with breast cancer less than a week before the UK went into lockdown. She quickly went into strict isolation with her husband, daughter and mother in their half-finished self-built home. âOur dream home became my hospital,â she says. Sarah had her first private chemotherapy session in hospital, then was told that it was too dangerous for her to come to hospital so she had at-home treatment every three weeks instead. âThat was terrifying as wellâ because she worried that the nurse could accidentally spread the virus. When she saw news stories about people breaking lockdown, Sarah felt âso angryâ, she says. âWe couldnât believe that other people were not taking it seriously.â Steve Priest, from Manchester, and his partner were both diagnosed with cancer at the start of lockdown and moved in together so that they could take turns looking after each other. He said that after he came out of one surgery, he was an âabsolute wreckâ and his partner had to care for him despite having just had major surgery herself. âWe were trapped and there was nobody, there was no support network and it made it 10 times worse,â he says. âIt was absolutely horrific.â âYou had people moaning about toilet rolls,â he remembers. âAre you for real?â Grace DeanBBC News \"We would go through the loneliness and pain of lockdown again in a heartbeat to save someone like Dad,\" Hannah Brady, 28, from Manchester says. Her Dad died of Covid in May 2020. Despite the lockdown preventing hugs at his funeral and stopping them holding a wake, she says she would do it again if it meant saving lives.   Sue Stollery, 64, North Wales also faced restrictions while holding a funeral for her husband Terry, who died on 13 March 2020 - just 10 days before the UK entered lockdown. Sue says she's been told by the funeral home that the cremation would happen regardless of lockdown restrictions: \"That's quite hard to be told that you might not be able to attend your husband's funeral.\" In the end, she was only able to invite nine other guests to his cremation, held on 27 March. \"It was horrible, just awful,\" Sue says. They had to sit apart during the ceremony, but when they went outside afterwards, \"we did all hug, even though we weren't supposed to,\" she says. Sue says that lockdown \"made it harder to grieve\", in part because she couldn't sit with her son, she says. She spent lockdown by herself in a flat, which she found \"isolating\". Sue Stollery and her husband Terry Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave evidence to the inquiry in December 2023 We might be hitting the fifth anniversary of the first Coronavirus lockdown, but the inquiry into how the government dealt with the pandemic is still ongoing.  Launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, the inquiry was set out to cover decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government, as well as the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. By the time it concludes, it will have heard from politicians, civil servants and health experts.  In July 2024, the inquiry's first report said the UK's flawed pandemic preparations had led to more deaths and greater economic damage than there should have been. The inquiry is currently in its fifth module which concerns procurement. This module will end next week.  While some of us were able to stay at home to stay as safe as possible - others worked to keep our essential services, including healthcare, running.  Here are some images you may remember from the time:  A healthcare worker administers a test through the window of a car at a Covid testing site A paramedic wears PPE outside St Thomasâ Hospital in Westminster, London Staff at University Hospital Monklands outside the ICU ward A nurse administers a vaccine to Margaret Keenan - the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine in the UK at University Hospital in Coventry Lucy Breakwell & Gemma SherlockBBC News, Lancashire Marley and Leo spend most of their spare time with each other Two mothers who gave birth during the coronavirus lockdown have spoken about how their children are now thriving as best friends despite being born during a \"lonely and scary\" time. Victoria and Francesca have lived on the same street in Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, for more than 20 years. But the pair found themselves forced apart when they had their children at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and unable to support each other during motherhood. Now, five years on, the friends say their bond has helped their children overcome \"loneliness\" and cement a special friendship. You can read more in our story.  Grace DeanBBC News Laura Reed was \"really scared and nervous\" in hospital Some new mothers spoke of the experience of giving birth alone during the pandemic, with their loved ones unable to stay with them in hospital. Laura Reed, 43, from Basingstoke, had a planned C-section in April 2020. She describes the maternity unit as \"eerily quiet\" and says she felt \"terrified\" to be in hospital alone - her husband dropped her off with a suitcase and returned the next day to pick her up. \"I was shaking a lot. I was really scared and nervous,\" she says. Neya Joshi, 33, from London, had an emergency C-section in May 2020. While her husband was able to accompany her on the labour ward, he couldn't stay with her on the recovery ward, she says. After her surgery, she was numb from the waist down and she was on a drip, so she couldn't reach to comfort her baby who was crying in a cot next to her bed, she says. She was the only patient who stayed on the ward overnight, and \"I was all alone just in this dark room with a screaming baby.\"  He struggled to feed and staff weren't helpful, she says. \"I just felt so incompetent, so helpless,\" Neya reflects. In the months that followed, she \"just kept having flashbacks of the time on the postnatal ward, just constantly reliving the fear and the horror and just the desperation\".  She was later diagnosed with PTSD and had therapy for about a year, she says - she's now using her experience to retrain as a postnatal doula. Neya Joshi says she had flashbacks for months after giving birth Jacky Edwards, from Glastonbury, came back to the NHS from retirement - and she \"made the most\" of Clap for Carers by coming out into her street wearing her wedding dress.  Edwards worked as a nurse in the intensive care units and tells Radio 5 Live she was among the most protected staff in the hospital.  \"I had a young child at\nhome so of course I was worried about bringing it home,\" she adds. As for her outfit choice for Clap for Carers, she explains: \"Iâm not a very celebrated person.  \"[Wearing my wedding\ndress] It was a tongue in cheek thing. I paraded up and down. \"My neighbours\nwould leave wine on my doorstep!\" Grace DeanBBC News The family pitched the tent indoors and used it for playing and eating At the start of 2020, Istvan Csajaghy and his partner had decided to buy a four-person tent in the Christmas sales ready to take their two children camping in the summer. But lockdown came instead. \"I got very frustrated having this brand new tent, still in its original packaging, a beautiful spring coming, and all of us stuck in the flat,\" he says. So the family pitched the tent in the living room of their flat in Edinburgh. It became somewhere for the children to play and the family to eat. \"It's not much, but it's funny how it managed to get us out of the lockdown mood, and it still felt like some sort of adventure,\" Istvan says. \"And there we forgot about the troubles outside, and just camped indoors.\" The family finally pitched their new tent on a campsite in July 2020.\"I can't even remember where we were,\" Istvan says. \"I wonder if we just booked the first camping space we found, just for the joy of pitching our brand new tent outdoors?\" Your Voice, Your BBC News Emma Fish, 53, from Atherstone, explains that lockdown provided the opportunity to consider seeking a formal diagnosis of autism for her son.  She writes that at the time, he was finding school \"increasingly difficult\" and experienced emotions including anger and stress.  \"Whilst lockdown and learning from home was difficult, it gave him the opportunity to be himself, and to learn at his own pace, without the pressures of social contact and the sensory challenges presented by the school environment,\" she says. \"I believe that without lockdown our son would have had severe mental health difficulties.\"  His diagnosis means Emma has a better understanding of how to help her son moving forward.  Grace DeanBBC News Laura Phipps had to speak to other new mums on WhatsApp, rather than attending in-person support groups Women say the pandemic massively shaped their experiences of pregnancy and new motherhood. Laura Phipps, 38, from Cambridge, had her first child in January 2020. Lockdown \"was probably the loneliest time of my life\", she says. \"The days were so long.\" She was one of many who had to get used to being a parent while cut off from conventional support systems. Though she had her husband, she missed out on spending time with her relatives and other loved ones. \"You just sit at home, WhatsApping the new mums who you knew were about five minutes away,\" she says. \"You were just sitting spending most of your time on your own... They say it takes a village to raise a child, but there was no village in Covid.\" She had to get breastfeeding support via Zoom call and show her GP her baby's Eczema over video call. Laura says it was sad that her relatives couldn't see her baby's first milestones. \"The first smile, the first words, the first steps, no one saw that stuff,\" she says. \"It just happened in our house.\" Many of the experiences we've heard about so far today have been tough ones - key workers who experienced exhaustion, a parent who missed the chance to be with her daughter before she died, and those who were vulnerable and had to isolate themselves from their loved ones.  Others have told us about the lighter moments they looked for at a time when many were struggling with fear and uncertainty.  We've heard about two highly unusual birthday celebrations - Felix who was greeted with chalked pavement messages from neighbours during a walk on his fourth birthday, and Joyce who received a 90th birthday parade on the back of a truck through her local village.  Joyce has since passed away but her daughter Kirsty told us she \"felt like a queen\". Elsewhere, Ian Gearing ended up babysitting fox cubs after the quietness of his village gave a local fox the confidence to leave them in his garden each day, while Carolyn Rowland treasured moments she could spend with her Dad watching Bargain Hunt before he died in 2023.  We've got plenty more anecdotes to come which you sent in via Your Voice, Your BBC News, so stay with us this afternoon.  Your Voice, Your BBC News \"Bitter\" and \"disillusioned\" are the words nurse Erica, from Edinburgh, has used to describe her feelings towards the doctors she worked with at the time.  \"I felt my safety was not taken into account,\" she explains.  Community palliative care nurse Katherine Lawson, 61, from London, is also critical of the protection available for key workers.  \"Hideous clapping for heroes on Thursdays [...] Obscene money spent on useless PPE,\" she says.  For Fiona Thompson, 63, from Bournemouth, her decision to come back to the NHS from retirement was  \"right\" but \"came at a price\".  \"I witnessed things that I never expected to see [such as] the junior doctor on the phone explaining the likely prognosis to a family for their loved one.\" While Anne, 53, in London, remembers crying in the bathroom for fear of the pace things were moving at. She describes a \"quietness\" in the ward with patients unable to talk and concerns that she might bring Covid back home.  Parts of the NHS were \"completely snowed under\", an ambulance caller has told our colleagues at Radio 5 Live today.  Caroline adds that some people were scared of going to hospital for fear of getting sick.  \"The calls that we were getting were quite distressing on a lot of occasions,\" she says, giving the example of a 14-year-old girl whose mum had diabetes and was struggling to breathe with Covid.  \"Her dad was also struggling to breathe [and] had a brain tumour. She was there with her nine-year-old brother. \"At that time because they hadn't got to grips with how to treat [Covid] properly, it was very depressing - you were sat there thinking...what's going to happen.\"  Your Voice, Your BBC News Student paramedic James Lidington, who is based in Stevenage, says he was deployed to the NHS frontline \"suddenly\" when the lockdown was announced. \"PPE became our second skin, our faces marked by masks that couldnât hide our exhaustion.\" he describes. \"It was a baptism of fire, but it shaped me.\" Gary Carey from Chipstead says \"friendship\" from colleagues kept him going - \"Covid showed the best and the worst of people,\" he says.  For Michael Gomez, 37 from Beaconsfield, who worked on the hospital frontline, his wife's pregnancy led to the decision they should live separately to reduce risk.  \"When I finally saw her again, she was in labour...After a tough few months, we were finally together again to welcome our baby boy.\" Grace DeanBBC News As we've been reporting, people had varying experiences during lockdown - some which were impacted by their access to space and facilities.  Laura, 45, from Hammersmith had three children under the age of five during the pandemic. \"My memories of lockdown are just buried trauma of what it did to me and the children, being shut up in a small flat with no end in sight.\"  Meanwhile, Gary Davis, 57 from Oldham, lost work as an actor - as did his wife, who worked in wardrobes for the theatre industry. \"There was no work at all,\" he says. They both started working at a distribution warehouse doing long night shifts, often working six or seven days a week, for minimum wage.  It was \"very, very tough work\" and social distancing was \"virtually impossible\", he says. There was \"little thanks\" for the work he and his wife did, he says. \"Meanwhile we would see friends on social media sitting in their hot tubs drinking Prosecco,\" he adds. After about nine months at the warehouse, they both switched to jobs in a mobile Covid testing unit. Gary Davis and his wife lost their freelance jobs in the theatre industry Grace DeanBBC News London's Regent Street, which is usually packed with shoppers and tourists, was deserted during the pandemic With more time on everyone's hands, some people used the opportunity to pick up new hobbies. Eva Charrington, 59, from Tonbridge, Kent, took up watercolour painting during the pandemic. She watched YouTube tutorials and painted scenes of her village.  Describing her new-found hobby, she says: âI was in a completely different world and I just completely forgot all the chaos and stress that was going around\". Meanwhile, the chance to explore new activities and grow closer to family members meant that Anoushka Patel, 17, from Leicester, felt \"a sense of loss\" when the lockdowns were over.  \"Those quiet moments I'd had when the streets were silent, the air felt still and you could breathe in the fresh air rather than the traffic smog were suddenly gone,\" she says.  \"The humdrum of urban life resumed, and I knew the momentary peace I'd felt wouldn't return.\"   Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Ban kids from social media? Maybe, says Adolescence writer",
        "content": "Jack Thorne from Bristol co-wrote the hit Netflix show Adolescence The writer of the Netflix drama Adolescence has suggested that children should be denied access to social media to protect them from toxic ideas online. Jack Thorne, together with actor Stephen Graham, created the drama series about 13-year-old boy Jamie, who is accused of murdering a girl at his school. The series tackles themes of bullying, incel culture â incel is short for involuntary celibacy â and navigating social media as a young person. Bristol-born Mr Thorne said: \"We do believe perhaps the answer to this is in parliament and legislating â and taking kids away from their phones in school and taking kids away from social media altogether.\" He said it was not difficult to put himself into Jamie's head, a child who felt  \"isolated\", who thought he had found \"the answer to his pain\" in toxic masculine ideas found online. Stephen Graham co-created the show and stars as dad Eddie, with Owen Cooper playing 13-year-old Jamie The four-part series â which stars Graham as dad Eddie and Owen Cooper as Jamie â was the most-watched show on Netflix around the world in the days after its release last week. It shows how corrosive messages from misogynist influencers on social media can corrupt the minds of teenage boys. Mr Thorne said he wanted parents to watch the series with their children so they talk about the difficult themes. He said engaging with toxic ideas online was \"a logic that was incredibly troubling to me because it's a logic that I know some people would have been incredibly drawn to, including me when I was a kid\". \"If I'm 13 and I feel alone and isolated and unattractive... these things then sound like the answer to my pain,\" Mr Thorne said. Drama shines light on 'growing problem' - PM Former England manager Sir Gareth Southgate has spoken about the need for more action to support young men to navigate identity, culture and resilience. \"[Young men] spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography,\" he said in a speech on Thursday night as part of the BBC's Richard Dimbleby Lecture series.  \"This void is filled by a new kind of role model who do not have their best interest at heart. Their sole drive is for their own gain.\" Dr Nathan Eisenstadt, senior researcher at the University of Bristol, teaches young people how to intervene in situations that pave the way for sexual assault. \"A murder doesn't just happen,\" Mr Eisenstadt said. \"A person will have done a series of low-level behaviours. \"Maybe that's comments which reveal their attitude about women.\" Martin Bisp is CEO of Empire Fighting Chance, a Bristol boxing club which also offers mentoring for young people. He said young people have an urge to express themselves and often turn to the internet. \"There's been a cut back of services for young people so they resort to things they know, which might be online stuff,\" Mr Bisp said. \"Mentoring shouldn't just be fluffy. If views are expressed that aren't right it's about challenging those views.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Bristol Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Government borrowing higher than expected in February",
        "content": "UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, adding pressure to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Spring Statement next week. Borrowing - the difference between spending and income from taxes - was Â£10.7bn last month, according to official figures. The government's independent forecaster had predicted that borrowing would be Â£6.5bn for the month. Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts next week to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy, which the Treasury reiterated were \"non-negotiable\". \"We must go further and faster to create an agile and productive state that works for people,\" said Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, adding that the government \"will never play fast and loose with the public finances\". However, economists have warned the higher-than-expected borrowing last month \"puts more pressure\" on the Chancellor ahead of the Spring Statement on Wednesday. What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement? Dennis Tatarkov, senior economist at KPMG, said the latest borrowing figures raised the risk of Reeves missing her self-imposed borrowing rules. Most governments in wealthy nations have such rules, which are designed to reassure investors and maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves's two main rules are: not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending; and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economic output by 2029/30. Isabel Stockton, senior researcher for the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said Reeves had \"boxed herself in with promises to meet her fiscal targets, not to raise taxes further and not to return to austerity for public services\". She added that \"easy or risk-free options for the Chancellor are in short supply\". Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he expected further spending cuts \"on top of the welfare cuts already unveiled\". At the Budget in October, the government's official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) indicated Reeves had Â£9.9bn available to spend against her borrowing rules. But next week the OBR will be likely to conclude the chancellor's buffer has been \"wiped out\", Mr Kerr added.  Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the UK's \"weak public finances mean spending cuts in the Spring Statement\", and added that \"taxes will rise in October\". This week the government revealed plans for major changes to the benefits system aimed generating savings of Â£5bn a year in response to the UK's growing welfare bill. Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pip), which will affect hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits in cash terms at Â£97 per week until 2029/30. The prime minister has also announced NHS England will be scrapped, along with some other arms-length government bodies. But aside from spending cuts, the government has said it will increase defence spending, though the funds are being reallocated from the international aid budget. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said the latest borrowing figures were \"yet another major blow to the Chancellor's faltering plan for growth, and show her approach is simply not working\". She added National Insurance increases for employers, set to come into effect in April, would \"hammer small businesses\". The BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment.

        "title": "TikTokers call for 'chubby filter' to be banned",
        "content": "Sadie said she didn't think the filter should be allowed on TikTok without some kind of warning A viral filter which made people appear overweight has been removed from TikTok, after the BBC reported it had sparked a wave of user criticism. Known as a \"chubby filter\", the artificial intelligence (AI) tool took a photo of a person and edited their appearance to look as though they had put on weight. Many people have shared their \"before and after\" images on the platform with jokes about how different they looked - however, others said it was a form of \"body shaming\" and should not be permitted. Experts have also warned the filter could fuel a \"toxic diet culture\" online and potentially contribute to eating disorders. TikTok said the filter had been uploaded by a CapCut, which is separate from TikTok but has the same parent company, ByteDance. TikTok also told the BBC it was reviewing videos uploaded to the app that used the effect, and was making them ineligible for recommendation and blocking them from teen accounts. It added any videos that breached its community guidelines - for example by featuring bullying or harassment - would be removed. Sadie, who has 66,000 followers on TikTok, had been one of those calling for the \"mean\" filter to be banned. \"It's definitely a step in the right direction,\" she said after the filter was taken down. \"I'm happy that TikTok did that, because ultimately social media should be a fun, lighthearted place, not somewhere where you get bullied for how you look,\" the 29-year-old from Bristol said.  She said she was contacted by women who said they had deleted TikTok from their phones because the trend made them feel bad about themselves.  Dr Emma Beckett, a food and nutrition scientist, told the BBC she felt the trend was \"a huge step backwards\" in terms weight stigma. \"It's just the same old false stereotypes and tropes about people in larger bodies being lazy and flawed, and something to be desperately avoided,\" she said. She warned that could have a broad social effect. \"The fear of weight gain contributes to eating disorders and body dissatisfaction, it fuels toxic diet culture, making people obsess over food and exercise in unhealthy ways and opening them up to scam products and fad diets.\" Nina said the filter made her feel 'uncomfortable' Prior to the app being pulled, the BBC spoke to a number of TikTok users who said they were uncomfortable with the filter. Nina, who lives in north Wales, said she felt it fed into a \"narrative\" being spread online tying together people's appearance with their self-worth. \"This is a toxic view that I thought we were moving away from,\" she said.  \"If a filter is clearly offensive it should be removed,\" she told the BBC. Emma, who lives in Ayr, agreed. \"My first thought when I saw the 'chubby filter' was how damaging that would be. \"People were basically saying they looked disgusting because they were 'chubby' and as a curvier woman, who essentially looks like the \"after\" photo on this filter, it was disheartening for me.\" Emma said she was concerned that young girls and boys might see the filter and think they were \"the butt of the joke\" By Jessica Sherwood, BBC Social News Filters - which use AI to manipulate a person's appearance - are common on TikTok. Many are harmless - for example one popular trend makes it appear as if a person was made out of Lego. Some of the most popular videos using the filter have been liked tens of thousands of times, external. For the purpose of this article, I used the filter on myself. I felt incredibly uncomfortable. As someone who is very body positive and has struggled with their self-image in the past, using it couldn't be further away from how I personally use social media and I was unhappy that TikTok pushed it to me in the first place. The filter changed my entire appearance, complete with text stating it \"makes you chubby\" This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content. After I watched the video and read the comments, TikTok began to suggest similar videos from other people using the filter, and even another where AI can turn you thinner. Thankfully it also began to start showing me creators who were criticising the trend, some of whom we've spoken to for this article. AI images and filters have become commonplace on TikTok and quickly accepted to be used for fun - the same way some Gen-Zs and Millennials might remember  Snapchat filters.  But filters like these, although they may seem fun, can be very damaging to someone's mental health and encourage them to compare themselves not only to others, but an unrealistic version of themselves. What do you think should happen to tools such as the âchubby filterâ?

        "title": "Sudan war: Army recaptures presidential palace in Khartoum from RSF",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Sudanese troops film themselves in presidential palace The Sudanese army says it has recaptured the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after almost two years of fighting.  Reclaiming the east African country's seat of power marks a major victory for the army, which has been making significant advances against the RSF in recent months. \"There will be no negotiations until these people are no more,\" vowed Sudan's de facto president and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Friday. But his troops are still a long way from ending the war entirely, with large parts of the country still under the RSF's control. It is also unclear whether the battle for Khartoum is over: an RSF statement said its fighters were still in the area. \"Our valiant forces are still present in the vicinity of the area,\" read an RSF statement  issued on the messaging service Telegram. RSF said a drone strike it launched on the palace complex left numerous dead - including a team of journalists from Sudan's state TV station and two of the army's senior media liaison officers. Bloody clashes are also expected to carry on as the army tries to corner remaining fighters, who occupy swathes of territory to the south of the palace. They also control parts of the nearby airport. However, the capture of the palace - which came after fierce battles in the centre of the city - was marked with joyful posts by soldiers on social media. Posts showed jubilant soldiers cheering and kneeling to pray at the entrance.  Nabil Abdallah, the army spokesperson, said on state TV that the military had taken control of the palace and ministry buildings on Friday morning.  \"Our forces completely destroyed the enemy's fighters and equipment, and seized large quantities of equipment and weapons,\" Abdallah added.  Army spokesperson Nabil Abdallah made the announcement of the capture of te palace on state TV  People in the capital - where some of the biggest battles of the last two years have been fought - are still reeling from life under the RSF soldiers, who have been accused of widespread looting and human rights abuses. Residents say they feel relieved and safe now that the territory has been taken back by the army.  Some have been saying that they would finally be able to sleep at night. The conflict,  which began in April 2023, has taken a huge toll on civilians, with 12 million people forced from their homes and millions facing famine. The gravedigger 'too busy to sleep' as Khartoum fighting rages 'Tortured and terrified' - BBC witnesses the battle for Khartoum How events unfolded in Khartoum on Friday The capital is not the only place the Sudanese Armed Forces have been making gains:  the army has also taken parts of central Sudan in recent weeks. But this does not represent an end to the war as the RSF still controls large areas of the country, particularly in the western Darfur region. In a video recording on Saturday, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, had vowed to defend the presidential palace and surrounding areas that are under the control of his paramilitary group.   He also threatened further attacks in several northern cities. Several peace efforts have collapsed as the rival forces pledge to continue fighting to control strategic areas.  As well as causing the world's largest humanitarian crisis, according to the UN, both the RSF and the army have been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

        "title": "NewJeans: K-pop group ordered to stop independent activities",
        "content": "A South Korean court has ruled against chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans which had sought to cut ties with its record label Ador.  The court said the band, which had renamed themselves NJZ and began organising their own appearances, must not conduct any independent activities - from making music to signing advertising deals.  Earlier last year, NewJeans said that they were leaving Ador, after accusing them of mistreatment. Ador subsequently sued to have NewJeans' contracts upheld and, after accusing the group of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, filed an injunction against them in January. The group has said that they will challenge Friday's decision. The court's ruling casts some uncertainty around the release of the group's new song, slated for Sunday. It also means they will now face difficulty re-debuting under their new name, NJZ, without facing severe financial penalties for breach of contract. NewJeans and Ador have been embroiled in a dramatic dispute since August 2024, when Hybe, the parent company of Ador, allegedly forced out NewJeans' mentor, Min Hee-Jin. The band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored â and, when Hybe refused, went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim it had deliberately undermined their careers. One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label. In a press conference in November, NewJeans announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists. On Friday, the Seoul court ruled that NewJeans' claims did not \"sufficiently prove that Ador violated their significant duty as part of their contract\", adding that the music label had upheld \"most of its duty including payment\". \"If [NewJeans] unilaterally terminate the contract, Ador would suffer greatly. And if [NewJeans] begins activity under a new name, it could severely damage not only the brand of NewJeans but the reputation of Ador,\" the court's statement reads. The group says they respect the ruling but has argued that they did not have sufficient opportunity to fully present their case to the court. \"We plan to challenge today's decision... during which we will raise additional legal issues and submit further supporting evidence,\" they responded in a statement just hours after the ruling.  \"Regardless... we can no longer remain with a management that has disrespected our identities and undermined our achievements.\" A lawsuit regarding the validity of the two parties' contract termination is still underway. Record label takes legal action against K-pop band K-Pop group NewJeans split from agency in mistreatment row NewJeans: The controversy shaking the K-pop world The five band members â Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein â have over the past few months continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name \"jeanzforfree\". They have also said they would fight to keep their name, and their career, and would remain \"NewJeans at heart\" even if they lost the fight against Ador. NewJeans were considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, thanks to a playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies. In 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards.

        "title": "Heathrow closed all day after nearby fire causes power outage",
        "content": "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an investigation into the power outage that caused Heathrow to close on Friday, following a fire at a power substation The airport's chief executive says he hopes the findings will \"help strengthen the airport's future resilience\" as Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says it is \"imperative to identify what happened\" Heathrow Airport is now \"fully operational\" though some disruption continues as more than 100 flights have been cancelled at the airport on Saturday The BBC has been hearing from some of those affected by the disruption The question of how to safeguard against future damaging power outages has now entered the equation, BBC's Marc Ashdown writes This video can not be played 'No comment': Heathrow boss asked if he should stay in job Edited by Matt Spivey Matt SpiveyLive editor The day began with passengers flooding into Heathrow as the airport confirmed it was fully operational after a complete shutdown on Friday - caused by a power outage sparked by a fire at a nearby substation. Despite the resumption of planes landing and taking off, disruption is still ongoing with more than 100 flights having been cancelled or delayed on Saturday.  We heard from some of those affected including Liz, who was \"devastated\" to miss her youngest son's graduation in Sterling and friends Farah and Niken who have missed part of their friend's wedding in Cambodia. In a gripping interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Heathrow chief Thomas Woldbye said he was \"proud\" of how the airport handled the incident. This afternoon, the government ordered an \"urgent investigation\" into the power outage, as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he is \"determined\" to understand \"what happened and what lessons need to be learned\". We then heard again from Woldbye who said he is committed to a thorough investigation and hopes the findings will \"strengthen the airport's future resilience\". We'll soon be closing our live coverage, but it remains unclear how much longer disruption will affect flights at Heathrow. Thanks for joining us. As we've been reporting, the government has ordered the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to conduct an investigation into the power outage at Heathrow Airport. Let's recap what the key players have been saying: Energy Secretary Ed Miliband says he will work in partnership with Ofgem to \"properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned\". Transport Secretary Heidi Alexandersays it is \"imperative\" to \"identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong\". Akshay Kaul, director general for infrastructure at Ofgem, says the regulatory authority will \"not hesitate to take action\", adding that they will work to ensure NESO's review \"goes as far as possible\" to ensure steps are put in place to avoid similar events in the future. Fintan Slye, Chief Executive of NESO - who have been commissioned to lead the investigation -welcomed the commission adding that the operator will work with \"all relevant stakeholders to understand the lessons that can be learned to improve the future resilience of Britainâs energy system\". Heathrow Airport's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Woldbye welcomed the investigation and hopes the findings will \"help strengthen the airport's future resilience\". Tom SymondsBBC correspondent Heathrow has three electricity substations known as \"Grid Supply Points\", each with a backup. There are also reserve diesel generators. Uninterruptible battery-powered supplies provide enough power to keep safety critical systems - such as aircraft landing systems - running. These supplies do not have enough power to keep the whole airport in operation. Heathrow also has a biomass-fuelled combined heating and power station, producing 10 megawatts of power, which feeds electricity and heat to Terminal Two. The fire at North Hyde Point in Hayes put both the substation, and its backup, out of action. On Friday, Heathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining grid supply points. The airport's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, said these remaining grid supply points were capable of powering Heathrow, but only after a complex process.  This involved reallocating the remaining supplies then restarting and testing everything from escalators to aircraft fuelling systems - which took most of Friday to achieve. The power outage that forced Heathrow to close yesterday was caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation The independent National Energy System Operator (NESO), which will investigate the power outage, says it \"welcomes the government's commission\". Fintan Slye, NESO's chief executive, says in a statement: \"We will now work with all relevant stakeholders to understand the lessons that can be learned to improve future resilience of Great Britainâs energy system.\"  The Department Energy Security and Net Zero says it expects NESO to report back with initial findings within six weeks.  NESO is expected to work with Heathrow Airport to ensure the investigation is \"comprehensive and thoroughly examines the causes of the incident,\" the statement adds.  Heathrow Airport's Chief Executive Officer Thomas Woldbye welcomes the investigation into the power outage that closed Heathrow Airport on Friday. In a statement issued in the last few minutes, he says he hopes the findings will \"help strengthen the airport's future resilience\". \"We will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident and we are committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure a thorough investigation,\" Woldbye adds. Earlier, Woldbye was questioned on BBC's Today programme, where he described the fire at a substation near to Heathrow \"unprecedented\", adding he is \"proud\" of how the airport handled the incident. Akshay Kaul, director general for infrastructure at Ofgem, says in the Energy Security and Net Zero department's statement that the authority \"will not hesitate to take action.\" He adds that Ofgem will work to ensure the National Energy System Operator's review \"goes as far as possible to ensuring steps are put in place to avoid any repeat of an incident of this scale in the future\". The statement from Kaul also says that households and businesses \"should be able to have confidence in the resilience of critical national infrastructure\". Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says it is \"imperative\" to \"identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong\". Within the statement from the Energy Security and Net Zero department, she warns \"some disruption is expected\" over the coming days and urges passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling. Alexander adds that the incident caused \"significant disruption\" but praised emergency services for working \"swiftly\". We're now seeing a full statement from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, following Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's comments a short while ago. The department says the National Energy System Operator's investigation will support efforts to \"build a clear picture of the circumstances\" surrounding the power outage at Heathrow and the UKâs energy resilience more broadly so that itâs prevented from ever happening again.   \"The governmentâs Plan for Change is rebuilding Britainâs resilience, including boosting the countryâs energy security with homegrown power. Separately, the resilience review led by the Cabinet Office is ongoing and is due to conclude in the Spring,\" the statement reads. The statement also includes further comments from Energy Secretary Miliband, who says the government is \"determined to do everything it can to prevent a repeat of what happened at Heathrow. This review will be an important step in helping us to do so, as we deliver our Plan for Change\". We'll bring you more from the department's statement in our next few posts. A moment ago, we brought you news that the energy secretary has commissioned in investigation into the incident at Heathrow.  In a post on X, Ed Miliband writes: \"The loss of power to the Heathrow area has caused major disruption to thousands of people and many businesses.  \"We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned.\" He says he is working with Ofgem and has commissioned the National Energy System Operator to investigate the incident. Miliband says the investigation will look for \"wider lessons\" on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.  Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has commissioned an investigation into the incident at Heathrow, to be carried out by the National Energy System Operator.  We'll bring you more on this in our next post. Anna HolliganReporting from Amsterdam's Schipol Airport Amsterdamâs Schiphol Airport is Europe's fourth-largest, serving approximately 67 million passengers annually.  Schiphol has faced power-related issues in the past, such as a voltage drop in Tennet's high-voltage grid in 2018, which led to disruptions in operations.  This incident resulted in improvements in monitoring of the emergency power generators and response systems. Schiphol is implementing energy storage solutions, such as iron flow batteries, to reduce reliance on diesel generators and improve environmental sustainability.  Despite these measures, like Heathrow, in the event of a major power substation failure Schiphol's systems might not be designed to power the entire airport indefinitely without external support.  Both incidents resulted in substantial disruptions to flight operations. At Schiphol in 2018, the power outage led to the closure of the airport, with flights delayed or cancelled, affecting thousands of passengers.    But the Schiphol outage in 2018 was due to a general power failure in the Amsterdam region, with the airport reopening after several hours once check-in systems were restored.    Both scenarios highlight the importance of robust backup systems and emergency response plans to mitigate the impact of power outages. More than 100 flights through Heathrow have been cancelled today, one day after a power outage brought the airport to a standstill. Although Heathrow Airport is now \"fully operational\", we've been keeping a tally of all the cancelled flights on Heathrow's departure and arrival boards today. British Airways has been particularly affected, but other carriers are seeing cancellations, too. Here's what we found: More than 30 departing flights cancelled You can check the status of your departing flight via your airline and on Heathrow's online departure board., external More than 70 arriving flights cancelled You can check Heathrow's arrival board on their website, external. The term substation has been in the forefront of our coverage, as the disruption at Heathrow Airport yesterday was caused by a fire at a power substation in Hayes.  Elizabeth Orchard from the Institution of Civil Engineers explained to our colleagues at BBC Breakfast exactly what a substation is.  She describes it as a \"stopping point\" for electricity as it journeys from where it is generated to where it is used. Large amounts of energy are used to enable the electricity to travel long distances. There are two types: transmission substations and distribution substations. Transmission substations handle high-voltage electricity transmission over long distances, while distribution substations bring down the voltage for local distribution to homes and businesses. Orchard adds that fires are \"incredibly rare\" as \"substations are some of the best maintained infrastructure around the country\". We're now hearing from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury who tells the BBC that there is \"a lack of power grid capacity\" in the area surrounding Heathrow, with no new overhead lines expected until 2036. She says it is too soon to tell whether this shortage had an impact on the closure of Heathrow Airport yesterday, after a substation fire caused a power outage. Cadbury, who is chair of the Transport Select Committee, adds that the previous government has shown a lack of interest in Britain's infrastructure over the past 15 years. She insists the Labour government is picking up on these issues but says it will take time to \"ensure our key national infrastructure is fit for purpose\". Asked about plans for a possible third runway, she says it will take years but by that time \"West London may have secured the additional grid capacity it needs\". In terms of mitigating the type of crisis we saw yesterday, she adds that Heathrow and airports in other countries will be \"looking at their systems in the weeks to come\". BBC's Emma Barnett earlier put it to Heathrow's Chief Executive Thomas Woldbye that yesterday's full closure may impact passengers' trust in the airport - especially ahead of its controversial plans to build a third runway. Woldbye said that he has \"full trust in the fact the airport can build a third runway that is resilient\". Let's take a look at those plans for a third runway: Marc AshdownBusiness correspondent Yesterday's closure at Heathrow Airport was caused by a power outage following a fire at a substation in West London In the end, Heathrow Airport was only out of action for 18 hours, but it left vital cargo - such as life-saving organs - stranded mid-transit. While passengers, pilots and planes have been scattered across Europe. The airport's boss Thomas Woldbye said planes could have taken off and landed yesterday, but it was not safe to do so without back-up power to infrastructure such as runway lights, fuel systems and air bridges. He insisted any airport would have responded in the same way, and said Heathrow uses as much power as a city and would need to install an expensive standalone generator to absolutely guarantee no power outages. With one business leader labelling the UK a \"laughing stock\" over the incident, could this incident now weigh on its future investment plans? Heathrow recently announced a multi-billion pound expansion plan, including revamping two terminals and adding a controversial third runway. But the question of how to safeguard against damaging power outages has now entered the equation too. We're seeing images showing passengers filing into Heathrow after it was announced that the airport is \"fully operational\" today. Although flights to and from the airport have resumed, some airlines are warning passengers to expect delays.  Air India has just announced that their operations to and from Heathrow Airport have started again following yesterday's disruption.  \"Todayâs flight AI111 was on schedule and other flights, to and from London, are expected to operate as per schedule,\" it says in a statement.  Meanwhile, flight AI161 - which diverted to Frankfurt - \"is expected to leave Frankfurt at 14:05 pm local time\", the airline says. Farah Rafeeq (L) and Niken Wulan (R) Farah Rafeeq, 24, says she is frustrated to miss part of her close friendâs wedding after the fire which closed Heathrow Airport on Friday. She was due to travel with Singapore Airlines with her 32-year-old friend Niken Wulan, who is pregnant, to a wedding in Cambodia on Sunday. The mass-cancellation of flights means they will now miss part of the ceremony. They have found an alternative flight from Gatwick Airport with Turkish Airlines and Bangkok Airways that will get them to Cambodia for Sunday afternoon. Farah tells the PA news agency today that the last few hours have been \"nightmarish\" because \"it is one of our closest friendsâ wedding and we have to travel for at least 20 hours to get there\". âWe had to pay double the amount, between Â£600 and Â£700, for the new flight, and we had planned this trip for months and had hotels booked,\" she says. âWe are missing the morning ceremony but at least we can make it for the reception.â As we continue to update you with the latest developments on Heathrow Airport, we're looking to hear from you.

        "content": "Several major airlines have said they will resume flights as some overnight restrictions are lifted Flights have resumed at Heathrow Airport and a full service is expected on Saturday following an \"unprecedented\" loss of power caused by a nearby substation fire. About 200,000 passengers were affected as flights were grounded throughout Friday, with inbound planes being diverted to other airports in Europe after flames ripped through the North Hyde plant in Hayes, west London, on Thursday evening. The airport's chief executive Thomas Woldbye apologised to stranded passengers and said the disruption was \"as big as it gets for our airport\" and that it could not guard itself \"100%\". The Met Police confirmed the fire was not believed to be suspicious.  Passengers waited to board flights as they resumed from Terminal Five on Friday evening The investigation will focus on the \"electrical distribution equipment\", the force said. British Airways announced eight of its long-haul flights had been cleared to leave Heathrow during Friday evening and it was \"urgently contacting customers to let them know\". Restrictions on overnight flights have also been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport said. Passengers have been advised to contact their airlines for the latest updates. Mr Woldbye said that a back-up transformer had failed meaning systems had to be closed down in accordance with safety procedures so that power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations to restore electricity enough to power the airport. Several airlines announced they would restart scheduled flights both to and from Heathrow, including British Airways, Air Canada and United Airlines. An airport spokesperson said the first flights were focused on \"repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe... and relocating aircraft\". Mr Woldbye said: \"I'd like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It's not a small fire. \"We have lost power equal to that of a mid-sized city and our backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport.\"  This video can not be played Watch: Large fire breaks out near Heathrow Airport Asked if there is a weak point in Heathrow's power system, he said: \"You can say that but of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them. \"I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport.\" \"This is unprecedented,\" he added. Mr Woldbye went on to say the airport expected to return to \"100% operation\" on Saturday. Follow live updates: Major flight disruption expected as Heathrow closes Heathrow Airport's departure halls were deserted throughout Friday Heathrow is the UK's largest aviation hub, handling about 1,300 landings and take-offs each day. A record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals last year, according to its latest data. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she believed airport bosses \"stood up their resilience plan swiftly, and they've collaborated closely with our emergency responders and the airline operators; they do have backup energy supplies, they have generators, diesel generators. \"None of that failed on this occasion because that backup supply is designed to protect the critical key systems within the airport and not to provide power to the whole airport.\" Alexander added that she was in close contact with the energy secretary, the home secretary and with Heathrow to \"make sure that any lessons we need to learn from the systems that the airport has in place are learned\". Ofgem, the energy regulator, earlier announced it would commission a review \"to understand the cause of this incident and what lessons can be learned\". Some 200,000 passengers were affected as flights were grounded throughout Friday  Emergency services were first called to the scene at 23:20 GMT on Thursday.  Some 120 aircraft heading to the airport at that time were forced to either divert or return to their point of origin. Ten fire engines and about 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze, LFB said, with the fire being brought under control by 06:30. London Fire Brigade (LFB) said the fire involved a transformer containing 25,000 litres (5,500 gallons) of cooling fluid that had been set alight.  A large cordon was put in place as a precaution and about 150 people were evacuated from their homes.  Most of those had returned home by 17:00, according to LFB. Hillingdon Council said it was assisting 12 people with hotel accommodation until it was safe for them to return to their homes. More than 65,000 homes in the area were left without power as a result, as well as the airport, although the National Grid said power was restored by 14:00.  London Fire Brigade said the fire was under control by 06:30 on Friday Local residents told the BBC they saw a bright flash before their lights went out. Savita Kapur, 51, said she \"literally just ran out of the house\" when she heard the first explosion. She said police officers told them to go back inside before eventually telling her she needed to leave. Ms Kapur said a \"second explosion went off\" as she was driving along the road \"and the whole ground shook\". Heathrow airport closed: What we know so far Heathrow shuts: 'We don't know what's happening next - it's chaos'  Heathrow closure: What are my rights? Police said they were keeping an open mind as to the cause of the blaze LFB said the transformer which caught fire 25,000 litres of cooling fluid A family from Texas faced frustration after arriving at Heathrow for their flight home to Dallas to find the airport closed on Friday morning. Andrew Sri, his wife and their three children, aged one to eight, had been visiting his sister in east London. \"I just wish they had updated us accordingly,\" Mr Sri said, as the family waited for updates at the terminal.  \"Now we've got here and they told us, 'actually the airport's been shut down', so it's a little bit disappointing.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Lives at risk due to medical scan mistakes, says ombudsman",
        "content": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned.  The most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly. The ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again.  NHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\". In one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO). The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.  A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel. However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery. The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.  Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.  Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.  The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.  Failings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests.  The man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen.  \"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\" A statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made.  \"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\" The trust has also agreed to pay the family Â£4,000, as recommended by PHSO.  In another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise.  The patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday.  His brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it.  \"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\" The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital. However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy. He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous. If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said. While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life. His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\" In a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident. \"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\" The trust has agreed to pay the family Â£3,500.  Ms Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care.  \"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\" The 2021 ombudsman report, external into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\". It is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added. Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements.  \"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said.  \"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\" The college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028.  An NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\" The spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\". Changes were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.

In Bangladesh, hijras - once a revered community - have long lived on the margins. Also known as the third gender, hijras form a diverse group, including those born intersex - meaning their physical traits don’t fit neatly into ‘male’ or ‘female’ categories - and transgender individuals. Traditionally seen as spiritual figures with the power to bless or curse, they are now outcasts, denied homes, jobs, and opportunities. But in a quiet village in Mymensingh, a spiritual revolution is taking place. Reporter Sahar Zand has gained rare access to this community, spending time with its leader, Tanu - a transgender woman and practising Muslim - who has built a sanctuary where hijras can reconnect with faith. At the heart of this transformation is a Quran study group, offering hijras the religious education they were long denied, and a newly built mosque - the first in Bangladesh to welcome them as equals, after they were expelled from others. With the help of an imam who risked everything to stand by them, they are reclaiming their right to Islam. But as religious conservatism rises, so do the threats against them. Their village is no longer just a refuge; it is the frontline of a battle for acceptance.

        "title": "Tesla vandals face up to 20 years in prison, says attorney general",
        "content": "The aftermath of an arson attack on a Tesla dealership in Oregon, pictured in court documents US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Thursday that three defendants accused of vandalism targeting Elon Musk's Tesla electric vehicle company could face up to 20 years in prison. Bondi said the damage to Tesla cars, dealerships and charging stations was \"domestic terrorism\". Arrests and charges against the three suspects were previously announced by prosecutors. Tesla dealerships across the country have been targeted in a wave of protests, but also vandalism and arson attacks, in response to Musk's influence over the Trump administration. This video can not be played Watch: Tesla vehicles and dealerships vandalised throughout US There is no specific US law against domestic terrorism, but prosecutors can request longer prison sentences if convicted criminals have a terrorism-related motive. Trump and Musk have called the attacks domestic terrorism, too. Supporters of the administration have also reportedly been \"swatted\" â subjected to armed police raids after hoax emergency calls. Tesla makes largest ever Cybertruck recall A statement from the Department of Justice on Thursday did not name the suspects in the Tesla vandalism. However, the details of the three cases outlined in the news release match arrests and charges previously announced by prosecutors. The suspects include Lucy Nelson, 42, who was charged with possession of a destructive device and malicious destruction of property after being spotted near the site of a Tesla dealership in Colorado. The dealership had been targeted with a Molotov cocktail attack and graffiti which caused damage of between $5,000 and $20,000, according to a criminal complaint. That suspect has pleaded not guilty. Graffiti targeting Elon Musk, pictured in a court document, was painted on a Tesla dealership in Colorado Adam Matthew Lansky, 41, was charged with possession of a destructive device after Molotov cocktails were thrown at a Tesla dealership in Salem, Oregon. He has yet to enter a plea and will face a preliminary hearing in April. The third, 24-year-old Daniel Clarke-Pounder, was charged with arson after allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla charging stations in North Charleston, South Carolina, and spray-painting the car park. In a statement, Bondi said: \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\" The attorney general said the three suspects could face between five and 20 years in prison if convicted.

        "title": "Elon Musk's Tesla makes largest ever Cybertruck recall",
        "content": "Thousands of Tesla Cybertrucks have been recalled in the US due to concerns about part of the electric car's trim falling off in the model's eighth and largest ever recall. The issue affects more than 46,000 trucks made starting in November 2023, which analysts say amounts to nearly all Cybertrucks. It comes as Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment, grapples with falling sales amid a backlash against the firm and its boss Elon Musk. On Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three unnamed people would face charges for setting fire to Tesla cars and charging stations, accusing them of \"domestic terrorism\". Tesla does not break out sales of the Cybertruck, but car tech firm Cox Automotive has estimated roughly 39,000 were sold in the US last year.   Prior Cybertruck recalls involved failing windshield wipers, trapped accelerator pedals, possible loss of drive power to the wheels, and other issues.  Tesla started investigating the latest issue, involving a piece formally known as the cant rail, in January, according to filings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), external. \"The cant rail, a stainless-steel exterior trim panel, can delaminate and detach from the vehicle,\" the notice said. \"A detached panel can become a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash.\" Tesla told NHTSA it had received about 150 claims from drivers about the issue but was not aware of any accidents caused by the problem.  It estimated that the issue affected about 1% of vehicles involved in the recall.  The issue is covered under a warranty for new owners, and the company will replace the piece free-of-charge. Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk Musk's Tesla raises concern over Trump tariffs Trump says anti-Tesla protesters will face 'hell' Tesla's shares have dropped nearly 40% since January, erasing the jump in value that it enjoyed after the 2024 US election. The fall has been significantly more than the overall drop in the US stock market over that period. Dan Ives, an analyst who has historically been very pro-Tesla, said on Thursday the firm was facing a \"tornado crisis moment\" due to brand damage from Musk's political role. The political backlash adds to the challenges the company had already been facing from increased competition and an ageing line-up of offerings.  The Cybertruck was supposed to help reignite buzz around the brand and help it break into the lucrative market for pickup trucks in the US. It hit the roads in late 2023 and carries a starting cost of more than $72,000 (Â£55,500).

        "title": "Ukraine's 'chaotic' withdrawal from Russia, in its soldiers' words",
        "content": "Artem and his unit would regularly cross into Russia - until last week Until just over a week ago, Artem Kariakin and his unit were making regular trips across Ukraine's border into the Russian town of Sudzha. He shows me video taken with a phone of their very last trip, as Ukrainian forces retreated from Russia's Kursk region. It shows them making their way past dozens of burnt out military and civilian vehicles. A soldier armed with a shotgun, their last line of defence, scans the horizon for Russian drones. Out of nowhere, one flies towards the back of their truck. Sparks fly, but they keep on going. Artem says they were lucky - the explosive charge was not big enough to stop them. Another truck nearby was less fortunate. It was already in flames. Artem admits Ukraine's retreat from Sudzha, the largest town Ukraine held in Kursk, was \"not well organised\". \"It was pretty chaotic,\" he tells me. \"Many units left in disarray. I think the problem was the order to withdraw came too late.\" It wasn't helped, he says, because units were operating without proper communications. The Starlink satellite systems they normally rely on didn't work inside Russia. The 27-year-old soldier still views the Kursk offensive as broadly successful. Artem says it forced Russia to divert its forces from the east. Most of Ukraine's troops still managed to escape in time â even if for many it was on foot. But he believes Ukraine's surprise incursion into Russian territory, launched last August, was too deep and too narrow - relying on just one main road for supplies and reinforcements. While Artem and his men were fleeing for their lives, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking by phone about trying to bring the war to an end. Artem says he finds that \"absurd\". \"To me these calls between Trump and Putin are just surreal,\" he says. \"Trump wants to end the war because he promised to do it - and Putin wants to deceive Trump to continue his war. I can't take their conversations seriously.\" Artem, whose home is in the now Russian-occupied Luhansk region, tells me he feels disappointed with the US and Trump. \"What can I feel when they just want to give away my home?\" Ukraine's incursion in August 2024 caught Russia by surprise Artem says he never believed that Putin would be willing to trade any part of Russia for Ukraine's occupied territories. But he still believes the Kursk offensive was important to protect its own border. Ukrainian troops may have been forced to retreat, but they still occupy high ground just over the border with Sumy. Ukraine is continuing its cross-border raids â not just into Kursk, but Belgorod too.  Serhiy's assault battalion helps plan these attacks â finding a way through Russian minefields and anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\". We joined him on a night-time mission to locate and recover armoured vehicles in need of repairs. It's the safest time to move close to the Russian border. Serhiy himself is no stranger to Russia: he was born there. He now has Belorussian citizenship, but he chose to fight for Ukraine. He justifies Ukraine's incursions into his former home. Russia too, he says, has been trying to create a buffer zone inside Ukrainian territory. Travelling in his Ukrainian-made armoured vehicle, Serhiy still lists the likely threats, now we are less than 10km from the Russian border: glide bombs, rockets and artillery, and drones fitted with thermal imaging cameras. Serhiy fights for Ukraine against the country of his birth His own vehicle is fitted with electronic counter-measures to jam enemy drones, but even those won't work against drones operated via fibre optic wires. Those can't be stopped, though on some routes Ukraine has now erected netting to try to catch the drones before they can hit their target. Our original search near the Russian border for a damaged US-made Bradley armoured vehicle is abandoned when Serhiy receives intelligence that Russian drones are operating nearby. Instead, he tries to locate another broken-down Bradley where the risks will be smaller. He and his driver still have to overcome obstacles along the way. Trees and branches lie strewn across their path â remnants from a recent Russian air strike. We see several more explosions in the distance, briefly turning the night sky orange. Serhiy eventually finds his broken-down Bradley. It's already been retrieved from the battlefield across the border and has been loaded onto a lorry to be taken back for repairs. The Bradley commander confirms to me that they've been fighting in Russia. He describes the situations across the border as \"difficult, but we're holding on\". The team found the Bradley, now back in Ukraine and heading for repairs The Bradley is another reminder of Ukraine's reliance on US military support. That now seems less certain with Trump's focus on peace talks. Serhiy says it's already clear to him that there's \"haggling behind Ukraine's back\". I ask Serhiy if he thinks European nations can fill any void left by the US. Is a European \"coalition of the willing\" enough to guarantee Ukraine's security?  \"I think if America doesn't help Ukraine, then a ceasefire will be agreed soon - but on extremely unfavourable terms for Ukraine,\" Serhiy replies. \"Europe clearly cannot resolve this conflict alone.

        "content": "Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will \"begin eliminating\"  the federal Department of Education (DoE)  Trump says that \"this is the right thing to do\", adding that the DoE will be shut \"as quickly as possible\" Most experts say that entirely scrapping the department would require an act of Congress The DoE is in charge of administering federal student loans for college and university students and offering assistance for low-income and disabled students  In the United States, schools are administered and paid for largely at the state level, especially for primary and secondary school - only about 13% of funding for those schools comes from federal sources The White House says that dismantling the department will improve student test scores and save money, but Democrats and other critics say the move would leave the most vulnerable students in the lurch This video can not be played President Trump signs order to shut education department 'once and for all' Edited by Caitlin Wilson Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Washington Calls to dismantle - or abolish - the Department of Education stretch back long before Trump's return to the White House, all the way back to its inception.  On the campaign trail soon after the department was created, Ronald Reagan described the department as a \"new bureaucratic boondoggle\" that allowed Washington, rather than \"local needs and preferences\", to determine how American children were to be educated. For 43 years, his vision for the department - backed by members weary of \"big government\" federal control over state issues - went unrealised. Similar arguments were made by Republicans during subsequent administrations, although a lack of Congressional support made efforts to dismantle or eliminate the agency impossible. \"I do not believe we need a federal department of homework-checkers,\" then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in 1995. Many of the same arguments are being made today - with the added injection of ferocious national \"culture wars\" that Trump's team has highlighted both during the campaign and while back in the Oval Office.  Now, those Republican efforts seem to have come to fruition, with Trump's signing of an executive order to work towards close the department. Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Surrounded by more than a dozen young children and a smattering of\nRepublican governors in the East Room of the White House, Donald Trump used a\nstroke of his pen to set into motion his plans to shut down the entire\nfederal Department of Education on Thursday afternoon. Getting rid of the agency has been a\nlong-standing aim for Republicans, and many conservative voters will\nenthusiastically support this move. America does badly in many international\nleague tables in terms of educational outcomes, and Republicans blame the\ndepartment for that - despite the fact that individual states already control\nalmost 90% of the money that educates children in US schools.\nNevertheless, the president wants more power devolved away from Washington. Even before today's action,\nthe department had seen around half of its 4,000 staff let go - just a\nweek after Congress passed a funding bill including its budget. That money is\nmainly used to provide support for low-income and disabled children and to\nadminister college grants for those students who need financial support. Trump says those programmes will continue, but be administered by other\nagencies. However, like many other recent policy moves of the Trump administration, this one will also be\nchallenged in the courts. Already 20 attorneys general from Democratic\nstates have started the process of lodging objections, and the formal\ndismantling of the department itself would need an act of Congress - and in\nparticular 60 votes in the Senate, which Republicans do not currently have. Former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO Linda McMahon heads the education department in Trump's second administration.  A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. McMahon has a long history with the WWE and Trump, who used to make occasional appearances at wrestling matches. She co-founded Titan Sports with her husband in 1980, which then became the parent company of WWE later that decade. She resigned as CEO in 2009 in order to undertake a failed bid to run for the US Senate. McMahon has little background in education, but did serve on the Connecticut state board of education from 2009 until 2010. In October 2024, an attorney for McMahon said she \"will vigorously defend\" herself against accusations filed in a lawsuit that month which claimed she turned a blind eye to child sexual abuse by a former ringside announcer at WWE, according to the BBC's US partner CBS, external. The lawsuit has since been paused, CBS reports, external. McMahon is not accused of sexual abuse. Linda McMahon Education secretary Linda McMahon has just spoken to reporters at the White House, following the signing of President Donald Trump's executive order asking her to begin dismantling the Department of Education - the agency which she runs.  McMahon refutes accusations that the order hurts education in the US, saying that Trump's goal is to \"improve education\" and get dollars \"back to the states, without the bureaucracy of Washington.\" She was asked on what would happen to specific arms of the department, like those that deal with civil rights complaints within the education system.  In response, McMahon says that the executive order \"did not specify what happens with any of the departments within Education,\" and that she is looking at where some of those responsibilities would best be reallocated. She suggests that civil rights complaints, for example, could be overseen by the Department of Justice instead. Asked about the layoffs that have already taken place at the Department of Education, McMahon says the cuts were done \"thoughtfully\" and to avoid duplication within the agency.  She adds that those who were laid off will get three months of full pay and benefits, as well as severance packages that are \"much more generous\" than those seen in the private sector. A US parents group has slammed President Donald Trump's executive order to dismantle the Department of Education as \"shameful.\" In a statement, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, the head of advocacy group MomsRising, says \"there is nothing to celebrate about an order that guts the education system we rely on\".  \"Today's executive order will undermine the success of our students and the viability of our workforce, now and for years to come,\" she says. Rowe-Finkbeiner notes that 90% of students in the US attend public schools, and that dismantling the education department will lead to large class sizes, more schools without equipment or books, and end to tutoring programmes. She adds that these changes will specifically impact students with disabilities. \"Education is a pathway to opportunity and to a workforce, economy, and country that can thrive,\" she says. \"It is deeply disturbing and truly shameful that the Trump administration is destroying that.\" Mike WendlingReporting from Chicago Although todayâs executive order fulfils a long-standing\nTrump campaign pledge, its long-term effects are far from certain. To officially abolish the Department of Education - whose duties include overseeing federal loans and grants for college and university students - will\nrequire action by Congress.  Jill\nDesjean, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Student\nFinancial Aid Administrators, says there's not a huge amount of political\nappetite in Congress to get rid of the department. And even if it were to be\ndissolved, there are many questions about if and how the functions currently\ncarried out by the department would continue. \"There's nothing wrong with being more efficient and making things\nwork well for the taxpayer,\" Desjean\ntells the BBC. But she says that cuts to Department of Education staff - about\nhalf of employees - have happened with alarming speed. \"It's hard to believe that there was very much deliberate\nthought behind them,\" she says.  In the short term, Desjean says, students shouldnât be put off from applying to university or\napplying for financial aid because of the changes. But the large programmes\nthat the department administers will not be immediately transformed without problems\ncropping up, she says.  \"We want to see some careful thought as to how things would\nbe done to reduce disruption,\" she says.  Even before today's executive order, the Trump administration said last week it planned to cut the size of the education department in half. The mass layoffs will affect nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March. \"As part of the Department of Education's final mission, the department today initiated a reduction in force impacting nearly 50% of the department's workforce,\" McMahon said in a statement last week.  She said the cuts would impact all divisions in the department and were made to \"better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers\". The agency had just over 4,000 employees when Trump was sworn into office, an announcement from the department states. It has the smallest staff of all the 15 US cabinet-level agencies. After the cuts, 2,183 people will remain, which included several hundred who retired or accepted a buyout programme earlier this year, the agency said. Kayla EpsteinUS reporter When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed\nhelp for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's\nOffice of Civil Rights (OCR). Rebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol\nsyndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised\neducational support. She says the school district isolated him for months, with\nonly special education teachers and limited faculty for contact. In October 2024, she filed a complaint with the OCR alleging the school violated federal disability law and only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and\nin a 1:1 segregated setting\".  Hours were gradually added back to her son's school day, Rebecca said, but he\nremained isolated. Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, but an\nOCR lawyer was facilitating a mediation with the school district as soon as\nApril. But before that could happen, the Trump administration fired\nthe Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son,\nthrowing her case - and others like it - into limbo. \"I\ndon't have any other option for this kid,\" says Rebecca, who asked the BBC\nto withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy.\n\"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's\nfair.\" Meanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants the OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him.  She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates. Less than an hour after Donald Trump signed the executive\norder that will âbegin eliminatingâ the Department of Education, weâre already\nhearing of plans to codify the document. South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds, who introduced legislation in November\nto abolish the DoE, says heâs already in talks with Education Secretary Linda\nMcMahon to seal the fate of the department. \"I am working on legislation that would return education\ndecisions to states and local school districts while maintaining important\nprograms like special education and Title I,\" Rounds writes on X. \"We are discussing this legislation with Secretary McMahon\nand we believe there is a very good path forward.\" Kayla EpsteinNational digital reporter Trump's executive order, which would only come into force\nwith the approval of Congress and will likely face many legal challenges, has\nthe potential to reshape how children are educated across the country. Although the department has little oversight over the day to\nday operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing\nfederal education guidelines and policies. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces US civil rights\nlaws at the education level, was one of the hardest-hit divisions in that first\nround of firings.  The administration\nshuttered seven of the 12 regional offices, including in major metropolitan\nareas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco.  This month the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office\nreceived an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" â along with\ntheir positions. The news left one Cleveland attorney who worked on\ndisability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\" The attorney worried not only about the individual cases\nstill underway, they told the BBC. \"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much\nbigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the\ndistrict,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared\nretaliation from the administration. \"We were already so incredibly flooded with\ncases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our\nprocessing time.\" With the new cuts, they said, \"This work will not be\nable to be done.\" During her Senate confirmation hearing last month, US President Donald Trump's pick for Education Secretary Linda McMahon confirmed any decision to dismantle the education department would need approval from Congress first. \"We work with Congress, it clearly cannot be shut down without it,\" McMahon told lawmakers. This video can not be played Department of Education 'cannot' be shutdown without Congress - Linda McMahon The department's allocation was $238bn (Â£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget. The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments. In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil. School choice advocates have been celebrating Trumpâs executive\norder. They believe it is the first step for more freedom for students\nand parents to move schools, backed by public money. Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children â a\npro-school choice advocacy group â said American education had been centralised\nâin one of our countryâs greatest failed public policies.â The signing was attended by Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms\nfor Liberty, a conservative âanti-wokeâ group that has also been heavily in\nfavour of expanding school choice. In a statement, Justice said: \"The promise to dismantle the\nDepartment of Education is not a new one, however President Trump is the first\nto follow through... I am proud to stand behind the president to undertake this\neffort and return education to the states and ultimately give the power back to\nthe parents.â Mike WendlingUS reporter When it comes to school choice, US students have a dizzying\narray of, well, choices. Traditionally there have been two main options: state-funded\npublic schools and private schools, often religiously affiliated. But in the 1980s and 1990s, amid fear of declining standards and\nfailing schools, a growing movement clamoured for more possibilities. Some districts set up charter or magnet schools. These often\noperate somewhat separately from the public school system. Some focus on one subject\narea or are selective â pupils take an entry test or must meet other criteria. Other initiatives include voucher systems â allowing students to\ntake the public money that would normally be used to educate them in a public\nschool to attend school in a different district or even pay for a religiously\naffiliated private school. In some states, students can enrol in schools outside their\nlocal areas, and thereâs also the growing popularity of homeschooling â where\nparents and students opt out of the system altogether. School choice is generally more popular among Republicans, which\nexplains the Trump administrations moves to increase it. But itâs a contentious\nissue and one that does not break down neatly along partisan lines. Some of the\nplaces where parents and students most exercise their ability to choose are\nbig, left-wing Democrat-run cities. An official copy of the executive order President Donald Trump\nsigned earlier has just been released. Its title is âImproving education outcomes by empowering\nparents, states, and communities.â Here is a breakdown of what it says:  The order does not give\na timeline for when this would need to take place, and does not go into detail\non what steps Education Secretary Linda McMahon should take to begin the\ndismantling of the Education Department. Lisa LambertReporting from Washington DC Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on\nEducation, has been warning for weeks that Trump's funding cuts to research,\nalong with the staff reductions in the department, would hurt higher education\nin the US. \"This is political theatre, not serious public policy,â he\nsaid after todayâs executive order was signed. âTo dismantle any cabinet-level\nfederal agency requires congressional approval, and we urge lawmakers to reject\nmisleading rhetoric in favour of what is in the best interests of students and\ntheir families.â Mitchell continued saying that significant harm had already been\ndone to students and taxpayers by the Trump administrationâs âarbitrary and\nmisguided steps to hollow out the department.\" He added that one itâs many \"critical functions\" is\n\"ensuring that student financial aid programs provide millions of low- and\nmiddle-income students access to postsecondary education.\" The department runs a massive program to provide low-interest\nloans and grants to help students afford university - both for undergraduate\nand graduate education. The aid program is expected to continue to exist, but\nmany university students are now wondering in what form, and if this means they\nmay receive less assistance in the future. Ana Faguy On his own, no. Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of\nthe department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US\nSenate - 60 out of 100 senators. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would\nneed at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political\nlongshot. Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to\ngain necessary support. A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was\nattached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans\njoined all Democrats in the House to vote no. Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent\nweeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves. The Department of Education has just released a statement\nfollowing President Trump's signing of today's executive order. It calls the order a \"history-making action\" that will\n\"free future generations of American students and forge opportunities for\ntheir success.\" The statement also repeats Trump's claim that dismantling the department\nwill send education \"back to the states where it so rightly belongs.\" As we reported earlier, a common misconception is that the\ndepartment operates US schools and sets curricula - but that is done by states\nand local districts. And a relatively small percentage of funding for primary\nand secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. The statement notes that \"closing the department does not\nmean cutting off funds from those who depend on them,\" vowing to continue\nsupporting students with special needs, college students and others. \"Weâre going to follow the law and eliminate the\nbureaucracy responsibly by working with Congress and state leaders to ensure a\nlawful and orderly transition,\" the department says. US President Donald\nTrump has just signed an executive order to shut down the Department of\nEducation - here is a recap of what's just happened: Trump has just signed the executive order to begin dismantling the Department of Education.

        "title": "Trump to order dismantling of US education department",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: President Trump signs order to shut education department 'once and for all' US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives. Accusing the agency of \"breath-taking failures\", the Republican president vowed to return the money it controls to individual states. \"We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible,\" Trump said, although the White House acknowledged that closing the agency outright would require an act of Congress.  The move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week. Most US children attend public schools, which are free and run by local officials.  A common misconception is that the federal education department operates US schools and sets curriculum, but that is primarily done by states and local districts. A relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. Most of the money comes from state and local taxes.  Established in 1979, the department administers student loans and runs programmes to help low-income students. But Trump has accused it of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual, and political material. LISTEN: Rejecting public education in Arizona Surrounded by children seated at school desks in the White House on Thursday, Trump said \"the US spends more money on education by far than any other country\", yet he added that students rank near the bottom of the list.  The Unesco Institute for Statistics said the US spends roughly 5.4% of its GDP on education, which is higher than many countries but not all.  The department's budget last year was $238bn (Â£188bn), which is less than 2% of federal spending.  The White House stated that his administration would move to cut parts of the department that remain within legal boundaries. The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government. At the signing ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.  He said he would find \"something else\" for her to do within the administration.  After Trump signed the order, Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy announced plans to bring legislation aimed at closing the department. But Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and closing a federal department would require 60 votes, making such a goal a longshot. A conservative pipe dream since Reagan  What Department of Education cuts mean for one mum What happens to student loans now? But even if the department is not formally closed, the Trump administration could decimate its funding and staff as it has done with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which subsequently stopped many of its programmes and humanitarian work.  The text of the executive order does not include specifics on what actions the administration will take and which programmes might be axed.  It orders McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure\" of the department and give authority of such matters to state and local governments. It also directs her to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".  This video can not be played White House: Students falling behind a 'national security issue' Soon after she was sworn in, McMahon sent the department's 4,400 employees a memo titled \"Our Department's Final Mission\", a possible reference to Trump's aim to close it.  \"This is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students,\" she wrote. \"I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\" Earlier reports suggested Trump would look to end some of the department's programmes and send others to different departments, such as the Treasury, something that still may happen but wasn't made clear in his executive order.  America's largest teachers' union recently decried Trump's plans, saying he \"doesn't care about opportunity for all kids\". In its statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: \"No-one likes bureaucracy, and everyone's in favour of more efficiency, so let's find ways to accomplish that.  \"But don't use a 'war on woke' to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.\" For more than 40 years, conservatives have complained about the department and floated ideas to abolish it.  Just two years after it was established by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, his Republican replacement, Ronald Reagan, led calls to undo it.  It is the smallest agency in the president's cabinet and takes up less than 2% of the total federal budget. Some of those staff have already been affected by the Trump administration's sweeping workforce cuts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Nearly 2,100 people at the agency are set to be placed on leave from Friday. Efforts by Doge to slash federal spending and radically restructure - or simply abolish - many government agencies have been overseen by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

        "title": "Reform UK row: Leaked messages reveal Nigel Farage fury with Rupert Lowe",
        "content": "Nigel Farage called the behaviour of suspended Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe \"disgusting\" and \"contemptible\" in private WhatsApp messages seen by the BBC. In the messages, which were sent after Lowe criticised the Reform leader in a Daily Mail interview, Farage accused him of \"damaging the party just before elections\". Reform has always denied there was any connection between Lowe's suspension and his criticism of the party. In his Mail interview on 5 March, Lowe called Reform a \"protest party\" led by \"the Messiah\". He was suspended on 7 March and reported to police over claims he had made threats of violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf.  Reform said it had also received allegations of bullying in Lowe's MP offices. Lowe strongly denies all the allegations. He has since accused Farage, external of a \"malicious witch hunt\" and being motivated \"to remove me because I dared to ask questions\". Responding to the latest development, external on social media, Lowe said: \"These messages unquestionably prove that the Reform leadership has zero integrity. \"Nigel Farage must never become prime minister.\" Farage told the BBC: \"The suspension was to protect the party, simple. The newspaper attack on Reform UK is separate but dreadful.\" He has previously insisted the party was duty bound to look into any allegations of wrongdoing. Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice previously told the BBC there was \"absolutely no truth\" in claims of a link between the decision to suspend Lowe and the allegations being made public. But a series of messages between Farage and someone who has worked for Lowe in recent years reveals Farage's personal anger with Lowe about his comments to the Daily Mail. Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe was suspended by Reform UK and referred to the police In one message, Farage says Lowe is \"contemptible\". When asked by the activist, who is not currently a party member, why Reform had not allowed a lawyer to complete an investigation before suspending him Farage said: \"Because he is damaging the party just before elections. Disgusting.\" When it was suggested the investigation into Lowe was a response to his criticism of the leadership, Farage replied on WhatsApp: \"We are definitely damaged and within two weeks of nominations. Awful.\" Farage went on to say the Mail interview was a \"side issue\" and that the party had to investigate the claims against Lowe. But the messages reveal a level of animosity between the suspended MP and his team and the Reform UK leadership, alongside the claims about his behaviour, which Lowe vehemently denies. The BBC's source is themselves the subject of an allegation of bullying, which they strenuously deny. Edited extracts from WhatsApp messages between Farage and the BBC's source The BBC has spoken to several members of Rupert Lowe's team. Among them are people who have worked alongside Nigel Farage for years and admired him. But many now are deeply critical.  One said: \"Nigel is thin skinned and egotistical. I have spent years defending him but the aura has gone for me now. Reporting Rupert to the police? Come on. They're trying to put him in prison!\" The staff member went on to claim that the root of this whole row was Elon Musk's praise for Lowe on X, saying: \"Nigel is very sensitive about his American contacts.\" Another staffer said: \"It is absolutely terrible the party going to the police.  \"You'd never find someone more kind and considerate than Rupert.  \"If you don't have policies as a party, you're a joke and that is what Rupert was pointing out.\" The BBC has also seen evidence of lengthy and detailed exchanges between Lowe's offices and Parliament's human resources team over the alleged conduct and subsequent departures of two members of staff. Edited extracts from WhatsApp messages between Farage and the BBC's source Lowe has long insisted that he and his staff diligently followed the due process parliament requires of them and there was no need for the party, or a senior lawyer hired by the party, to get involved. Reform UK has expanded rapidly, now boasting more than 200,000 members and regularly topping or coming second in national opinion polls.  But Nigel Farage has publicly acknowledged that infighting has damaged the party's chances of progress. Nigel Farage was unhappy about Elon Musk backing Lowe, sources say Rupert Lowe told the BBC: \"Farage has admitted himself, in writing, that the motivation behind my removal was the Daily Mail interview, in which I raised reasonable and constructive questions of Reform structure, policy and communication - following months of pushing for change behind the scenes.  \"That interview is why they designed and launched their horrific smear campaign against my name. It is evil behaviour. Nigel Farage must never be Prime Minister. All I have done is tell the truth, and I will continue to do so.\" In the WhatsApp exchanges, Farage is asked whether the row could have been better handled. He says that given the allegations of bullying \"in the current world we have to take this seriously and to be seen to take this seriously\".

        "content": "Badar Khan Suri is a student and teacher at Washington DC's Georgetown University A US court has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week. Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral fellow studying and teaching at the prestigious Washington DC institution on a student visa. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused him of \"spreading Hamas propaganda\" and having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist\".  Mr Suri's lawyer and employer have denied the allegation. His lawyer said in a court filing that his client was targeted because of his wife's \"identity as a Palestinian and her constitutionally protected speech\". In an order on Thursday, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Mr Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order\". In a sworn statement, his wife Mapheze Saleh said the detention \"has completely upended our lives\" and appealed to the court to allow Mr Suri to return home to his family. \"Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly,\" she said. \"As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.\" His arrest follows the detention or deportation of other foreign students and academics, including Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent Palestinian activist. Mr Suri was arrested outside his home in northern Virginia on Monday night by masked immigration agents, according to legal filings seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner.  He was told the agents were with DHS, the filings say, and they informed him the government had revoked his visa and he was now facing expulsion from the country. Mr Suri was taken to Alexandria Staging Facility in Louisiana where he is being held, according to US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, said on X that Mr Suri was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media\".  She accused him of having \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas\" without providing any further detail. Mr Suri's father-in-law is a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, the Washington Post and New York Times reported. In her court statement, Ms Saleh said her father lived in the US for nearly 20 years while pursuing a master's and PhD. \"Afterward, he served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as the deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza,\" she said. Ms Saleh said he left the Gaza government in 2010 and \"started the House of Wisdom in 2011 to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza\". Mr Suri's court filings allege that he and his wife Mapheze Saleh - a US citizen of Palestinian descent - had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\". The BBC has contacted Mr Suri's lawyer for more details.  A spokesman for Georgetown University told the BBC that Mr Suri had been \"granted a visa to enter the United States to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan\". The institution was \"not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention\". \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,\" the spokesman said. \"We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\" Students protested against Israel's attacks in Gaza across several universities last year, including at Georgetown in Washington DC In her post on X, Ms McLaughlin said Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"issued a determination on March 15, 2025 that Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\". The BBC has contacted DHS to request more detail on the allegations against Mr Suri, and also asked the Indian embassy in Washington DC for comment.  Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for \"violence and terrorism\". Khalil, a Columbia graduate and permanent US resident, was arrested on 8 March after being involved in pro-Palestinian protests on campus. He was accused of having ties to Hamas, which he denies. Columbia student Leqaa Kordia, who is a Palestinian from the West Bank, was  arrested for \"overstaying her student visa\". She had previously been arrested in April 2024 for taking part in protests at Columbia University, according to DHS. Ranjani Srinivasan, another Columbia University student, chose to \"self-deport\".  Officials said her student visa was revoked on 5 March. Her lawyers say she attended a handful of protests and had shared or liked social media posts related to Palestinians in Gaza. Brown University professor and kidney transplant specialist Rasha Alawieh, who is Lebanese, was deported after arriving at Boston airport. US officials said they found \"photos and videos\" on her cell phone that were \"sympathetic\" to the former longtime leader of Hezbollah and militants.  According to a transcript of her interview reviewed by Reuters, she told customs officials she did not support Hezbollah but had high regard for its leader because of her religion. \"I'm not a political person,\" she said. \"I'm a physician. It's mainly about faith.\" Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation?

        "title": "Cedwyn Scott: Carlisle forward on 'life-changing' mental health break Notts County allowed him",
        "content": "Cedwyn Scott started his professional career in Scotland with Dundee Cedwyn Scott says the break his former club Notts County allowed him to take from football to deal with mental health struggles was \"life changing\". The forward, who has since re-joined Carlisle United for a second spell, says he was grappling with loneliness and isolation before he sought help in October. \"I spent a lot of time on my own, and it was similar to what a lot of people maybe experienced during [the Covid-19] lockdowns, which I didn't get because I was at home with a lot of close-knit family at that time,\" he told BBC Radio Nottingham. \"I experienced real loneliness and I found it difficult.\" The gradual break-up of the Magpies side Scott helped to win promotion from the National League in 2023, and the departure of players he was \"very close with\", contributed to those feelings. There were also personal circumstances which meant the 26-year-old returned to Nottingham after the summer close-season break without his then partner. \"As a footballer you don't work the typical nine-to-five and you are not busy all hours of the day, so I found myself in my own company a lot,\" he said. \"Then I started to feel pretty down and just a bit emotional and didn't understand why.\" Carlisle re-sign striker Scott from Notts County Notts' Scott on leave to deal with mental health Every day a career battle, says Notts' Scott And those emotions followed him on to the pitch. \"I was finding it difficult to train,\" Scott said. \"I was still training and I wasn't really portraying it in terms of attitude, but I was finding it difficult to train well if that make sense. A lot of the things I was trying weren't coming off and I think that comes from the mental side of the game. \"When you see a striker who is confident, you see them scoring goals and everything they hit goes in. It felt the complete opposite of that, where nothing was going for me.\" Only a season earlier, Scott missed eight months of the 2023-24 campaign because of a knee injury. When he was given time off in October, he had not scored a goal for 18 months. For someone who had netted 15 goals in Notts' promotion-winning campaign - and been the one to send them back to the EFL with his National League promotion final-winning spot-kick in their penalty shootout against Chesterfield at Wembley - it was a a major comedown. \"Everything was against me in a way, and I found it really difficult so I just thought I needed to take myself out of the environment, try to take a break and have a little re-set,\" Scott said. \"Talking about it in therapy helped. It helped massively and changed my life to be honest. \"I had a light-bulb, life-changing moment during that and when I went back down [to train with Notts] I felt in a much better place to get going again.\" This video can not be played \"Spreading that awareness normalises it for people\" - Cedwyn Scott After seeking help and getting support from Notts and the Professional Football Association, Scott was back on the pitch within a month. He marked his return with a goal against Leicester City's Under-21 side in the EFL Trophy in November. Scott went on to score against Peterborough United in the FA Cup later the same month, but that was his last goal for the Magpies before he left to return to fellow League Two side Carlisle in January. He had spent six months in Cumbria in 2021 when he was trying to rebuild his career, having dropped down to play in England's 10th tier as recently as 2019 after featuring for Dundee in the Scottish Premiership just a year earlier. The spell he had at Gateshead after his time at Carlisle earned him the move to Notts, and his return to Brunton Park earlier this year also saw him reunited with his former Heed boss Mike Williamson.  \"It was really tough because obviously what had happened off the pitch played a big part,\" Northumberland native Scott said of his Notts departure. \"I wanted to be back closer to home and closer to family. \"But I wouldn't have made that move if it didn't make sense from a footballing point of view. To move back and play under that manager and his assistant again, it was something I loved doing at Gateshead and I knew they could get the best out of me.\" In his second appearance and just 19 minutes into his first start for Carlisle, he scored his long-awaited first English Football League goal to set them up for victory against Fleetwood. It was the last win of Williamson's reign, with the boss sacked in February and replaced by Mark Hughes in their battle to avoid relegation. And while Scott is focused on helping Carlisle fight their way up the league table, he says talking about challenges he has faced off the pitch is something he is determined to keep doing. \"The more people share their experiences - I've heard Kieron Dyer and Michail Antonio talk about it - it has really opened my eyes about it,\" Scott said. \"The more people share their own experiences then it resonates with more people.

        "content": "Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is no longer a suspect in the Police Scotland investigation into SNP finances. The announcement came as her husband, ex-SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with embezzlement. Mr Murrell made no plea during a private hearing and was granted bail. Speaking outside her home. Ms Sturgeon said she is \"completely in the clear\". She added: \"I have done nothing wrong... obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed.\" First Minister John Swinney says he shares the relief of Nicola Sturgeon at the police investigation into her actions being closed Today's events come two years after Ms Sturgeon unexpectedly announced her resignation as Scotland's first minister and SNP leader after eight years in office. This video can not be played Sturgeon: It's a relief to be rid of the cloud of investigation Edited by Paul McLaren As we draw our live coverage to a close, here's a reminder of today's news.  That's all from us today, thank you for joining us. The editor was Paul McLaren. The writers were Megan Bonar, Craig Hutchison and Steven Brocklehurst. David CowanHome Affairs Correspondent, BBC Scotland A legal clock has started ticking. Under rules brought in to deal with the\nbacklog in cases caused by the pandemic, Peter Murrell will have to stand trial within 18 months. Much of what happened today was absolutely\nstandard. Mr Murrell's legal team has been given the\nevidence which forms the basis for the first draft of charges he faced in\ncourt. That will allow his lawyers to prepare a\ndefence or to consider a guilty plea. What was unusual was the amount of detail in\nthe Crown Office press release on Mr Murrell's court appearance, a reflection\nof the public and media interest in the case. The Crown sought to explain the process,\nwarn all of us that proceedings are active under the Contempt of Court Act\n(with penalties of up to two years in prison and/or an unlimited fine), and point\nout that Scotland's chief law officers haven't been involved in any of this. The Lord Advocate and Solicitor General lead\nthe Crown Office but also act as chief legal advisors to the Scottish\nGovernment and its SNP administration. For that reason, they've played no part in\nthe decision-making process. Questions will no doubt be asked over the\ntime it's taken to get to this stage; the police inquiry into the SNP's funding\nand finances was launched in July 2021. Financial investigations are always complex.\nThe message from inside the investigation was that it would take as long as it\ntakes. As for how long it will be before we get to\nthe next stage of this saga, that will be decided by the lawyers and dictated\nby the workload in Scotland's courts. Colin Beattie gave his reaction to today's news in the garden lobby of Holyrood The former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie says he is very relieved by today's news and finding out he is no longer under investigation. \"I knew myself I'd done nothing wrong, but two years is a long time to be waiting for a result. \"It's been a hard time for my family, for my wife, for myself and I still haven't quite taken it on board.\" Colin Beattie is the former SNP treasurer We are just about to hear from Colin Beattie, who also arrested an released without charge as part of the Police Scotland investigation. He was the SNP's treasurer for a number of years meaning he was tasked with overseeing party finances. He has also been the MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh since he was elected in 2011. In 2023, he was arrested during the Operation Branchform investigation into the SNP finances. He was later released without charge, but resigned as SNP treasurer the day after. Police Scotland confirmed that inquiries into Beattie and Nicola Sturgeon had \"concluded\". It has been reported that Beattie intends to stand for re-election next year. John Swinney says his âfirm, principled leadershipâ should give\npeople âconfidenceâ about where the SNP is today. He says he is concentrating on addressing âthe priorities of\nthe people of Scotland directly, firmly and clearly\". \"We are determined to bring hope to the people of Scotland through Independence,\" he adds. BBC Scotland's political correspondent Lynsey Bews asks if the first minister is worried these events will still be hanging over the party in some sense ahead of the 2026 Holyrood elections. Swinney replies: \"We are in a much clearer position today.\" He adds: \"I think we can feel that some of the difficulties that we've experienced as a consequence of this investigation being under way have now moved on.\" Asked about the impact the Police Scotland investigation has had on the SNP,\nSwinney says it has \"of course\" contributed to the difficult times recently faced by the party\". He says the party has been an âalleged victim of embezzlementâ\nand the fact he is currently first minister is an indication of those\ndifficulties. What people should also know is that in my leadership of the Scottish National Party there will always be the highest standards of governance and financial control in place to make sure the SNP has a very secure future.â John Swinney, First minister John Swinney begins by pointing out there are live proceedings which he cannot comment on. The first minister is giving his reaction to news that the police investigation into Nicola Sturgeon has been closed. He says: \"This will have been a very difficult and challenging experience for Nicola Sturgeon and for Colin Beattie (the former SNP treasurer), and I know they will be relieved by the outcome of the proceedings today. \"I share that relief for them and I hope this provides the opportunity for Nicola and Colin to move on.\" We'll shortly be hearing from Scotland's First Minister John Swinney following Nicola Sturgeon's statement about the police investigation into her being closed. Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell recently announced that their marriage was over On a very busy day of news, it's worth pausing and taking stock of the events as they unfolded. Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is no longer a suspect in the Police Scotland investigation into SNP finances.  The announcement came as her husband, ex-SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with embezzlement.  Murrell made no plea during a private hearing and was granted bail.  Police also confirmed former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie was no longer under investigation. Making a statement outside her Glasgow home, Sturgeon said had been told she was now \"completely in the clear\". The former first minister said: \"I have done nothing wrong, and I don't think there was ever a scrap of evidence that I had done anything wrong.\" Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent After a process which has run for years, things have\nhappened very quickly for Nicola Sturgeon over the past week. Last Tuesday she announced she was going to stand down from\nthe Scottish Parliament, looking ahead to a new chapter in life after 27 years\nat Holyrood. Yesterday she underlined that writing is a big part of that,\nlaunching the title page and release date for her memoirs. And today a major cloud has been lifted from the horizon by\nthe fact she is no longer the focus of the police investigation. Yes, there is still the prospect of her estranged husband\nfacing a trial, having appeared in court this morning. There is no fixed timeline for any further appearance for\nPeter Murrell in the legal procedure; it could take many more months. But for Nicola Sturgeon, things have moved very swiftly\nindeed over the last few days. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon - 'It's been an incredible chapter of my life' Today's events come just over a week after Nicola Sturgeon announced she was to stand down as an MSP. The ex-SNP leader confirmed she would not seek re-election at the Holyrood election in May next year. After announcing her decision on social media, she told BBC Scotland News her time in parliament had been a \"privilege beyond words\". She added: \"But the time is right for me at this stage in my life to close the book on that chapter and open a new one.\" If you're just joining us, here are the key lines from the statement Nicola Sturgeon has just made outside her home near Glasgow.  The former first minister gave her statement after it was confirmed she is no longer a suspect in the Police Scotland investigation into SNP finances. Her husband, ex-SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court  earlier today charged with embezzlement. I'm looking forward to appearing in the Glasgow Comedy Festival this weekend actually which is perhaps a bit rash, but there you go.\" Nicola Sturgeon, Former First Minister Asked if the investigation has impacted the SNP, Sturgeon says it will have \"raised a lot of doubts\" about the party but she thinks polls suggest they still have support. \"The SNP is still the party that most people support, and I think\nthat is testament to the strength of the party and our record in government,\" she says. The former first minister adds that she has no plans to return to frontline politics and the current FM and SNP leader John Swinney has her full support. In response to a question about whether the police investigation had gone on too long, Sturgeon says: \"I was first minister of this country for the best part of a decade, I have utmost respect for the police and the prosecution authorities in our country and I'm never going to say or do anything to undermine that. All I can say is I have done nothing wrong and I don't think there was ever a scrap of evidence that I had done anything wrong. Therefore, of course to have something like this hanging over me for two years now has been difficult and frustrating - and I don't think I am saying anything there that people would be surprised to hear.\" Nicola Sturgeon, Former first minister Sturgeon tells reporters: \"As I have said to you many times, I have done nothing wrong so I was confident of reaching this point and getting to this outcome. \"Obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed.\" She says that for almost two years she had this \"cloud of investigation hanging over me\". \"It won't surprise anyone to hear that has not been an easy experience,\" she says. Speaking outside her home near Glasgow, Nicola Sturgeon says it has been a \"day of mixed emotions\" for her. She says she had been advised that after a \"very thorough investigation of all the evidence \" there would be no action against her. \"In other words I am completely in the clear,\" she says. \"That is the outcome I had always expected.\" Scotland's former first minister Nicola Sturgeon has begun to make a live statement outside here home. Stick with us and you can watch the statement in full by clicking on the Watch live icon at the top of the page. We'll bring you reports and analysis throughout the afternoon. Peter Murrell previously giving evidence to a Holyrood committee Peter Murrell, the man right at the heart of today's events, was the chief executive of the SNP for 23 years and is credited as playing an important role in the party's electoral success but resigned during a row over membership numbers. He is also the soon to be ex-husband of former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The pair married in 2010 but announced earlier this year they had separated. Murrell largely avoided the limelight as the FM's husband but his role as chief executive came under scrutiny during the inquiry into the Scottish government's handling of complaints against former SNP leader and First Minister Alex Salmond and again when it emerged he had given the SNP a Â£100,000 loan. He resigned in 2023 and the next year he was arrested and charged with embezzling party funds. In today's developments, he has now appeared in court and been released on bail. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

Peter Murrell was granted bail at Edinburgh Sheriff Court  Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell recently announced they were separated and in the process of ending their marriage.  Mr Murrell was charged in April of last year, having been arrested and released without charge the previous year.  He is understood to have resigned his SNP membership. Mr Beattie, the SNP MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, was arrested and released without charge in April 2023. Two months later Ms Sturgeon was also arrested and released without charge. Police Scotland confirmed that inquiries into both Ms Sturgeon and Mr Beattie had now \"concluded\".  The force said the pair had \"not been charged and are no longer under investigation\".

The first minister, Ms Sturgeon's former deputy, acknowledged the inquiry had been \"very difficult\" for the SNP. He said the court proceedings opened the possibility that the party had been the potential victim of embezzlement., and that he would ensure the \"highest standards of governance and financial control\" under his leadership.  Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell's home was searched by police in April 2023  Ms Sturgeon unexpectedly announced her resignation as first minister and SNP leader in February 2023 after eight years in office. She denied her decision was influenced by the police investigation. Mr Murrell resigned as SNP chief executive a month later having taken responsibility for misleading the media about party membership numbers. In April 2023, the home he shared with Ms Sturgeon was searched by police officers looking into what happened to Â£660,000 of donations given to the SNP by independence activists. Police also searched the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh and confiscated a luxury motorhome parked in the driveway of Mr Murrell's mother in Fife. The investigation, called Operation Branchform, has lasted almost four years.  In September last year it emerged that officers had sent prosecutors details of what they had uncovered in an \"advice and guidance report\" and were seeking formal advice on what they should do next. Ms Sturgeon announced last week that she will step down as an MSP at next year's Holyrood election. Mr Beattie intends to stand for election, though he is facing a selection contest for the SNP nomination in his constituency.  This investigation has been running for nearly four years. That may not be a long time in police work but it is an epic period in politics. Not only has this case been hanging over those at the centre of the investigation, it has cast a dark shadow over the party of government in Scotland too. It produced extraordinary scenes at the home Nicola Sturgeon shared with her now estranged husband Peter Murrell, with a blue police tent pitched in their garden. In Edinburgh, officers searched SNP headquarters and carried boxes from the building. Some very senior figures in the SNP believe they have paid a significant political price for this police work. They believe it was a contributory factor in their heavy losses at last year's UK general election. Nicola Sturgeon - who has always denied wrongdoing - once indicated that her personal experience of the police investigation had been \"traumatic\". That does not mean she will now seek some form of redress. My understanding is that she is more likely to let the issue go and try to get on with her life.

        "content": "This video can not be played Becky Burke's dad says she was taken from a detention centre handcuffed and chained at the legs and waist A tourist held in the US for 19 days was removed in chains like Hannibal Lecter, according to her parents. Becky Burke, 28, arrived home in Wales on Tuesday from her ordeal which began half way through a backpacking trip across North America. Parents Paul and Andrea Burke, of Portskewett, Monmouthshire, said their daughter was \"traumatised\" after being taken in \"leg chains, waist chains and handcuffs\".  The Northwest ICE Processing Center said in a statement: \"All aliens in violation of US immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States regardless of nationality.\" It said that Ms Burke was repatriated to the UK on March 18 after being detained \"related to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission\". Ms Burke's detention came as what her family think was a misunderstanding of her accommodation arrangements. She got free accommodation for helping host families \"around the house\", which her father believes authorities may have suspected broke the terms of her tourist visa. The US State Department says people on visitor visas are prohibited from carrying out \"employment\", external during their stay. Her parents said Becky had spoken about her removal by ICE agents.

Mr Burke said nobody outside of the detention facility knew she had been taken. \"She is not Hannibal Lecter,\" he said, referring to the cannibalistic serial killer film character portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. \"She said she could only walk with the support of an ICE officer,\" he added. Mrs Burke added she could not believe it when she was told. Becky Burke has been reunited with her family and dog, Bo Jangles Becky's parents said they were not sure their daughter was on the plane until she walked through the gates. \"It was very, very emotional,\" Mrs Burke said. \"We were on tenterhooks really, just watching the door for what seemed like forever.\" Mr Burke said: \"When you have been holding on like we have for this, when we saw her come through the gates, all of what we had held in was released. It was another surreal day.\" The couple were not pushing her to tell them what happened. \"It must be overwhelming for her to suddenly be able to do what she wants to do when she wants to do it,\" Mrs Burke said. \"And to sleep for as long as she wants to without fluorescent lights on 24 hours a day. \"But she also feels awful for leaving the others behind.\" Becky began her backpacking trip on 7 January \"She is enjoying some of the home comforts that most of us take for granted,\" Mr Burke said. \"Relishing just sitting in the garden, having a comfy bed, pillow and warm clothes. \"For 19 days she was just wearing the same prison clothes.\" \"There are lot of things we need to address through political channels to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" Mr Burke said. Catherine Fookes, the MP for Monmouthshire, has urged Foreign Secretary David Lammy to meet Ms Burke's family. \"Whilst I'm delighted she's home, I was really disappointed and actually quite shocked to hear that she was transported to the airport in the USA in chains despite doing absolutely nothing wrong and posing no risk,\" Fookes said in the House of Commons on Thursday. She asked Commons leader Lucy Powell if she would support a meeting between the Burke family and Lammy \"so they can feedback their difficult experience\" with US immigration to the Foreign Office to ensure \"lessons can be learned\". Powell said she was \"pleased to hear\" Ms Burke had returned home, adding she would ensure Fookes got a meeting with the appropriate minister. The Northwest ICE Processing Center said: \"All aliens in violation of US immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States regardless of nationality.\" Becky, an artist, wrote and drew while she was detained and her parents said she hopes to write a graphic novel about the experience. During her trip she stayed with families helping with housework in return for a place to stay. She was denied entry at the US-Canada border At the end of February she went to Seattle with plans to go to Vancouver, in Canada. But at the border, Mr Burke said Canadian authorities refused her entry, saying she needed to return to the US. There she was held at a detention centre in Tacoma, in Washington state. Mr and Mrs Burke said they had been completely overwhelmed by the support.

        "title": "Ethiopia does not want war with Eritrea, says PM Abiy Ahmed",
        "content": "Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says he wants to have negotiations over access to the sea  Landlocked Ethiopia has no intention of starting a war with neighbouring Eritrea in order to gain access to the sea, the country's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has said. A previous statement, in 2023, that having a seaport was an \"existential issue\" for the nation sparked concerns that the Ethiopia could take one by force. Abiy's comments to parliament on Thursday came amid fresh concerns that the neighbours, which have had a fractious relationship in the past, could be involved in a conflict again. The prime minister said the issue of sea access for the world's most populous landlocked nation should be resolved through diplomacy and mutual benefit. \"Our intention is to negotiate based on the principle of give and take. What the Eritrean people need is development, not conflict. Our plan is not to fight but to work together and grow together,\" he said. Nevertheless, he stressed that discussions around a seaport should not be taboo and that global norms support the idea that large nations require maritime access. In recent weeks, there have been fears that the war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region could resume, possibly with the involvement of Eritrea. A two-year civil war, which cost hundreds of thousands of lives, came to an end in November 2022, but elements of the peace deal have started to fray as politicians in Tigray have fallen out. There have been accusations that Eritrea is interfering in the region's internal political divisions. Last Thursday, Tigray's Interim President Getachew Reda accused his rivals of colluding with Eritrea, which previously supported the Ethiopian federal government during the civil war. \"We have reason to believe external actors are involved,\" Getachew said, alleging that Eritrea sees turmoil in Tigray as an opportunity for its own interests. However, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh dismissed these allegations, telling diplomats in the capital, Asmara, on Tuesday that his country \"categorically rejects\" any claims that it is involved in northern Ethiopia's tensions. But last week Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Gedion Timotewos told diplomats in Addis Ababa that his government suspects one of the factions in Tigray has links to Eritrea, though he did not provide specific details. Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia in the 1990s, which resulted in Ethiopia losing direct access to the sea. From 1998, the countries fought a two-year border war. Relations were finally normalised in 2018, after Abiy came to power in Ethiopia, but many of the changes that that brought about have since been reversed.

        "title": "Snow White film is both 'bad' and 'captivating' say critics",
        "content": "Rachel Zegler plays Snow White in the live-action remake British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive. Chief film critic for The Times, external, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, external called the film \"mostly captivating\". Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role. Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, external gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%. Disney's Snow White has been described by one critic as \"mostly captivating\" US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson. But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs. The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\". Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future. Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\" A classic Snow White moment is recreated in the film when the Evil Queen gives Snow White a poisoned apple Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline, external that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\" He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\". Variety's Owen Gleiberman, external called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\". He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".  Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\". Robbie Collin from The Telegraph, external gave the film a respectable three stars. \"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets â the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft â it really picks up,\" he said.   He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\". Gal Gadot plays the Evil Queen in the live-action remake of Snow White Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner, external giving the film two stars. \"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says. He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\". Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters. Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film. \"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.  \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\" Zegler also said, external the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\" Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years. However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.  Rachel Zegler performed at Spain's Alcazar de Segovia to launch the film in Europe Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian, external gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\". He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\". The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet. He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.  \"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\". Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (Â£217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film. Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent , externalgave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\". \"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula â do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.

        "title": "Turkey arrests dozens for online posts after Erdogan rival held",
        "content": "Police in Istanbul have used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators in a second night of disorder after the arrest of the Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu - despite a four-day protest ban being in place.  Imamoglu - a member of the secular Republican People's Party (CHP) and a key rival of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - was set to be named as a presidential candidate for the 2028 presidential elections later this week.  On Wednesday, he was one of 106 people held on charges including corruption and aiding terrorist groups. Since then, authorities in Turkey have arrested dozens of people for \"provocative\" social media posts.  Responding to the protests, Turkey's President Erdogan accused his political opponents of theatrics for taking part in a second night of demonstrations. \"They have lost the balance so much that they are in a state to attack our police, hurl threats at judges, prosecutors,\" he said.  Addressing a crowd of demonstrators outside Istanbul's city hall, Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Imamoglu's CHP party, accused the government of attempting a \"coup\" and said people had the right to protest.   But government officials have criticised the opposition for calling for demonstrations. \"Gathering and marching in protest are fundamental rights. But calling to the streets over an ongoing legal investigation is illegal and unacceptable,\" justice minister Yilmaz Tunc wrote online. A message posted on Imamoglu's X account, external on Thursday called on Turkey to \"stand against this evil as a nation\", and urged members of the judiciary and of Erdogan's party to fight injustice.  \"These events have gone beyond our parties, political ideals. The process is now concerning our people, namely your families,\" Imamoglu said. \"It is time to raise our voices.\" However, numbers of protesters are still relatively small for a city with more than 16 million people. For now, they are unlikely to raise political pressure on Erdogan to release Imamoglu.  Authorities must either release or charge Imamoglu by Sunday at the latest. This video can not be played Watch: Istanbul mayor says he's 'facing intimidation' in video message before his arrest The arrests of Imamoglu and others follow a major nationwide crackdown in recent months, targeting opposition politicians, journalists and figures in the entertainment industry. Some fear more will be brought in for questioning over the coming weeks as part of a campaign of intimidation.  Opposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the justice ministry on Wednesday criticised those who linked Erdogan to the arrests, and insisted on their judicial independence. Imamoglu won a second term as Istanbul's mayor last year, when his CHP party swept local elections there and in Ankara. Tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets on Wednesday after the mayor of Istanbul's arrest Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu? It was the first time since Erdogan came to power that his party was defeated across the country at the ballot box. The elections were also a personal blow to the president, who grew up in and became mayor of Istanbul on his rise to power. Erdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey. Due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution. The CHP's presidential candidate selection, in which 1.5 million members will vote and Imamoglu is the only person running, is set to take place on Sunday. The party has also called on citizens to vote in a symbolic election, with plans to place ballot boxes in districts all over Turkey for people to show their support for the detained mayor.

        "title": "Yorkshire Water ordered to pay £40m over 'serious failures'",
        "content": "Ofwat said Yorkshire Water had recognised its failures and was taking steps to \"put it right\" Yorkshire Water has been ordered to pay Â£40m to address its \"serious failures\" over wastewater and sewage. An investigation by regulator Ofwat found on average the firm discharged untreated wastewater into the region's rivers for seven hours a day in 2023, with almost half its storm overflows found to be in breach of regulations. The cost of the enforcement package, which would be invested in the region, would not be passed on to customers and instead it would be paid for by the firm and its shareholders, Yorkshire Water said. The company apologised for its failings and said it had taken active steps to remedy the issues, but chief executive Nicola Shaw said there was \"still more for us to do\". Ofwat's investigation, which began in 2021, found the firm had failed to adequately invest in and maintain its networks. In its conclusion published on Thursday, it said Yorkshire Water had significantly breached its legal obligations, which had caused an \"unacceptable impact\" on the environment and customers. Ofwat's senior director for enforcement, Lynn Parker, said: \"Our investigation has found serious failures in how Yorkshire Water has operated and maintained its sewage works and networks, which has resulted in excessive spills from storm overflows.\" Ms Parker said Yorkshire Water had recognised this failure and was taking steps to \"put it right\". \"They deserve credit for stepping up and agreeing an enforcement package with us that will help get things back on track as soon as possible,\" she added. \"If they don't put in place the improvements that they have said they will, then we will step in and take action.\" Yorkshire Water's Nicola Shaw apologised for the firm's \"past mistakes\" Ofwat said Yorkshire Water had been ordered to pay Â£36.6m during 2025-30 to prioritise work on some of the most problematic storm overflows in environmentally sensitive areas to ensure they spill less than 20 times a year. It would also be expected to pay Â£3.4m to the Great Yorkshire Rivers Partnership, which would be used to clear artificial barriers in rivers, improve water quality and promote biodiversity.  Yorkshire Water's chief executive, Nicola Shaw, said the firm had already completed work at 70 storm overflows and was due to start a Â£1.5bn programme to reduce discharges even further over the next five years. She said: \"We know there's still more for us to do. \"We apologise for our past mistakes and hope this redress package goes some way to show our commitment to improving the environment.\" The BBC previously reported the firm's plans to increase bills by 41% in the next five years. Ms Shaw, who was paid a Â£371,000 bonus in 2024, said at the time the price hike would pay for supply upgrades and go towards reducing sewage discharges and storm overflows. A spokesperson for the Great Yorkshire Rivers Partnership said: \"We welcome the additional funding. \"By reinvesting this money in Yorkshire, even more projects will be delivered by Great Yorkshire Rivers partners across the county to support the recovery of our native fish species.\" Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

        "title": "More than a fifth of UK adults still not looking for work",
        "content": "More than a fifth of UK working-age adults are still not in work or actively looking for work, official figures suggest. The UK economic inactivity rate was 21.5% in the three months to January, marking a drop from both the previous quarter and year, and is relatively low compared with trends since 2009. However, the number of people not looking for work has been brought into sharp focus as the government brings in plans to try to boost UK economic growth. The figures come after controversial plans to cut sickness and disability benefits were announced this week, and ahead of next week's Spring Statement when Chancellor Rachel Reeves will give an update on her economic plans. On Tuesday, the government announced sweeping cuts to sickness and disability benefits aimed at saving Â£5bn a year by 2030. It says the measures will encourage people to work while protecting those who cannot. But the reforms have faced fierce criticism from Labour backbenchers, unions and charities, who say the changes could push more disabled people into poverty. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the latest employment figures \"demonstrate the scale of the challenge we're still facing to get Britain working again\". Labour has targeted an employment rate of 80%. It currently stands at 75%. Work coaches to focus on long-term unemployed Starmer says cost of sickness benefits 'devastating' Who are the millions of Britons not working? The former John Lewis boss Sir Charlie Mayfield has been leading the Keep Britain Working review, which was commissioned by the government to look into the role of employers in health and disability. \"[Employers] need to create the environment so people can talk about the help they might need,\" he told the BBC. The UK needs to move from a disjointed system that focuses on what people can't do to one that focuses on what they can do, he said. \"Being off work is not always the solution.\" The review found that there are 8.7 million people in the UK with a work-limiting health condition, an increase of 2.5 million over the last decade. This includes 1.2 million 16 to 34-year-olds and 900,000 50 to 64-year-olds. It also found that people who are out of work for less than a year are five times more likely to return to work compared to those who are out of work for longer. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said its jobs figures should be treated with caution because of low response rates to its employment survey. Nevertheless, it said economic inactivity  - where people are out of work and not looking for work - has generally been falling since comparable records began in 1971. There are currently 9.27 million people classified as economically inactive. Reasons for economic inactivity include long-term sickness, studying, retirement and caring responsibilities. It increased during the Covid pandemic, and has fluctuated around this increased rate. However, economic inactivity for all age groups fell over the year by 0.6%, and fell 0.2% on the quarter largely because of more people aged 35 to 49 looking for work, the ONS said. In its labour market release, the ONS said pay growth continued to outpace inflation. Wages excluding bonuses grew 5.9% in the quarter, compared with the previous year, with retail, hospitality and construction wages seeing strong growth. In real terms, taking into account inflation, regular pay grew 2.2%. Redundancies rose for the first time in a year to 124,000 in the three months to January. The Bank of England watches the pay and jobs data closely when making decisions on interest rates. In its latest decision on Thursday, the central bank held rates at 4.5%.

        "title": "Cafe repair team in Pocklington works to end 'throwaway culture'",
        "content": "Damien Cunningham brings his skills to the repair cafe A group that repairs broken equipment is working to combat a \"throwaway culture\" by restoring items back to working order. The Pocklington Repair Cafe says its aim is to keep things that can be repaired out of landfill. The East Yorkshire group is one of many around the country that includes volunteers from many walks of life who share their skills and tools with each other, and with those bringing something that needs fixing. It can sometimes be easy to throw the item away and buy a new one, but the group hopes they can make a difference, both to the environment and - during the cost-of-living crisis â to the pounds in people's pockets. Damien helping Stephen with his trolley The group holds a drop-in session every few months at the town's Scout Hut. On this occasion, Stephen Ward has brought in a trolley that needs fixing. He relies on it to help him with walking, and says it would be a challenge finding another one that suits him. The trolley fixing that needs repairing Amateur repairer Damien Cunningham is having a go at fixing a broken rod which holds it all together. The part that's broken is relatively rare, so Damien is trying hard to find something else that fits. \"We still have the problem that one of the key fixings is missing,\" he says. \"It's the sort of job [where] at home I would make one, but I don't have the facilities here.\" It takes Damien more than an hour to come up with a solution, but eventually Stephen gets to wheel his fully functioning trolley home rather than having to throw it away. Lyn's lamp has come in for repair Lyn Gregory, meanwhile, has brought in a lamp that isn't working but which she had hoped to give to the hospice shop where she helps out. This turns out to be a quick fix, with the team at the repair cafe also giving it a free electrical safety check. \"I'm delighted,\" says Lyn. \"I hate waste, and it wasn't working and I couldn't sell it... but now it can be [sold].\" Elizabeth Walker set up the volunteer group Elizabeth Walker, who set up the Pocklington group, says this is just the sort of thing they get together for. \"Mostly they are just domestic items â kettles, toasters, things like that. But occasionally we do get sentimental items in that need fixing,\" she says. Elizabeth credits the whole team with making it all work. \"We've just got some very willing volunteers. They've learned how to mend things, and they're offering their services. And they share their expertise with each other, and their tools.\" Adam Bell prepares to solder an item that has sentimental value This month's session has been a success. Everyone seems to have gone away happy, despite some challenging jobs. The benefits are obvious, say the volunteers. Why buy something new when you don't have to? And why fill up precious landfill space when so many things can be repaired or reused?

        "title": "Royal Mail launches mythical creatures stamp collection",
        "content": "The eight stamps feature mystical creatures and figures from UK folklore  Royal Mail has unveiled a set of stamps featuring mythical creatures and fabled figures from UK folklore. Designed by London-based artist Adam Simpson, the illustrations include the Loch Ness Monster, Cornish piskies, and Beowulf and Grendel. The set of eight stamps and the stories each represents from different regions across the UK \"demonstrate our rich mythological heritage\", Simpson said. They are available to pre-order from Thursday and go on sale on 27 March. The Myths and Legends set of stamps celebrates 'a fascinating aspect of British culture and custom,' Royal Mail said Other stamps in the Myths and Legends collection depict Blodeuwedd of Welsh mythology, Irish heroic figure Fionn mac Cumhaill, the spectral hound of East Anglia, Black Shuck, selkies and a grindylow. Grindylows are sprites with long arms that lurk in rivers and ponds ready to snatch curious children in folklore from Lancashire and Yorkshire, while selkies are fabled creatures from Orkney and Shetland which shed their seal skins to take human form. Simpson, whose previous work has been shortlisted for a British Design Award, said creating the stamps was a \"privilege\" and he was \"really happy\" to receive the commission. \"I think it's important to celebrate where these stories come from,\" he said. \"Each one is associated with a region, and each one has its own identity, and together they demonstrate our rich mythological heritage.\" Simpson previously designed a Royal Mail stamp to celebrate the Triathlon at the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Illustrating stamps is challenging, he said, because \"the composition needs to work at such a small scale\". To portray the fight between Beowulf and the monster Grendel, from the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, he had to \"figure out how to have two figures in a space that works on a small scale\" and \"wanted to suggest that Beowulf defeats Grendel by tearing off his arm without the image becoming disturbing\". Grindylows are sprites that lurk in rivers in Lancashire and Yorkshire waiting to catch curious children Fionn mac Cumhaill, of Northern Ireland folklore, built the Giant's Causeway, outwitting a Scottish giant Simpson said the project became a \"real labour of love\" and took more than a year to complete, with the illustrations evolving over time. \"It gave me the chance to be fully immersed in the world of these myths and legends. I hope that the stamps either start conversations or invite people to investigate the stories if they're not familiar with them.\" In folklore, Cornish piskies steal household items and lead travellers astray with their winking lights David Gold, director of external affairs and policy at Royal Mail, said: \"For some parts of the UK, local myths and legends are as much a part of their identity as the local landmarks and architecture. \"These beautifully illustrated stamps celebrate a fascinating aspect of British culture and custom.\" The Royal Mail's Special Stamp programme commemorates anniversaries and aspects of UK history and culture, with the first commemorative stamp issued in 1924 to mark the opening of the British Empire Exhibition.

        "title": "Warning over hands-free breastfeeding in baby slings",
        "content": "Childbirth charities are warning parents that hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, when a baby is being carried in a sling, is unsafe. The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) and the Lullaby Trust say the risks are highest for premature babies and those under four months old because their airways can be easily blocked. Their updated guidance follows an inquest into the death of a six-week-old boy who was being breastfed in a baby carrier while his mother moved around their home. A coroner's report to prevent future deaths like his found there was very little information on safe positioning of babies in slings or the risks of suffocation when feeding. The baby, Jimmy Alderman, from London, was being breastfed in a sling in October 2023, but was in an unsafe position too far down the sling and lost consciousness after five minutes, the coroner found. Attempts were made to resuscitate him straight away, but he died three days later. Senior coroner for west London, Lydia Brown, issued a warning, external about the dangers of baby slings following an inquest held last year into his death. She said there appeared to be no helpful visual images of \"safe\" versus \"unsafe\" postures for babies in slings or carriers, adding that \"the NHS available literature provides no guidance or advice\". The NCT said it \"immediately reviewed\" its online information on baby slings and carriers after receiving the coroner's report and hearing feedback from Jimmy's parents. The NCT's online advice, external now says: \"Hands-free breastfeeding or bottle feeding, where the wearer moves around and does other jobs while the baby is feeding, is unsafe. \"This is especially true for babies under four months old. It also applies to babies born prematurely or those with a health condition.\" The charity says young babies do not have strong necks and cannot lift their heads, meaning that their airway \"can easily be blocked\" in baby slings and carriers. It adds that a sling's fabric or the fabric from a parent's clothes \"could cause suffocation very quickly\". \"If the sling or carrier is not correctly fitted and adjusted, babies can experience traumatic head injuries,\" the charity's advice says. The NCT goes on to say that slings should be: tight enough to hug your baby close to you you should always be able to see your baby's face by glancing down they should face upwards, not into your body your baby's head should be close enough to kiss The Lullaby Trust said it had also changed its advice to parents, external.  If your baby needs to feed, take them out of the sling, it now warns. \"We are constantly reviewing the evidence and research, as there is currently no robust evidence on how to feed hands-free safely, which is why we changed our guidance to advise against it,\" said CEO Jenny Ward. The charity is helping to fund research to develop better guidance for parents and carers on the safety of baby slings and carriers. The NHS website says when using a sling or carrier, do not let the material cover your baby's head.

Trump said the latest tariffs would come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Charges on parts are set to start in May or later. The president claimed the measure would lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the car industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US. But analysts have said the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. The US imported roughly eight million cars last year, accounting for about $240bn (Â£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.  Mexico is the top foreign supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Trump's latest move threatens to upend global car trade and supply chains.  Many US car companies have operations in Mexico and Canada as well, set up under the terms of the longstanding free trade agreement between the three countries.  The White House said the order would apply not only to finished cars but also to car parts, which are often shipped in from other countries before getting assembled in the US.  However, the new tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico are exempt while US customs and border patrol set up a system to assess the duties, the White House said. The neighbouring countries see goods worth billions cross borders each day. On Wednesday, shares in General Motors slid roughly 3%. The sell-off spread to other companies, including Ford, after the president's remarks as he confirmed the tariffs. Asked at a press conference if there was any chance he would reverse course, Trump said no, adding later: \"This is permanent.\" \"If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff,\" he said. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said his government would put \"all options on the table\" in response to the tariffs.  Japan, which is home to several major motor industry giants,  is the world's second largest exporter of cars. Shares in Japanese carmakers - including Toyota, Nissan, Honda - fell in early trade in Tokyo.  Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Trump has embraced the tool, looking to apply it to a host of goods being imported into the US as part of a wider drive to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing. But while the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for businesses reliant on parts from abroad, as is the case for car-makers. Analysts have estimated that the cost of a car could rise thousands of dollars, with 25% tariffs on parts from Mexico and Canada alone adding $4,000-$10,000 in cost depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group. The fresh car import taxes on cars are set to come into force on the same day as so-called reciprocal tariffs kick in for individual countries based on their trading relationship with the US. It is not clear how the car tariffs might affect those plans.  But many countries, including the UK, are concerned about their exporters being hit as a result of the new taxes.  The US was the top sales market for British-based Jaguar Land Rover last year, with the carmaker selling 116,294 vehicles to Americans, exceeding sales to customers in the UK and China. The UK government is in talks with the US administration and remains hopeful of a trade deal before tariffs come into force, the BBC understands.  This video can not be played Watch: Automobile tariffs a 'direct attack', says Canadian PM Mark Carney Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called Trump's announcement a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry.  \"This will hurt us, but through this period by being together we will emerge stronger,\" he said.  European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would consider the measures before any potential response. \"As I have said before, tariffs are taxes â bad for businesses, worse for consumers equally in the US and the European Union,\" she said. \"The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\" For the UK, the US is the second largest car export market after the EU, with mainly luxury cars shipped across the Atlantic, according to the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, urged the UK and US governments to \"come together immediately and strike a deal that works for all\". The car industry was already grappling with expanded tariffs on steel and aluminium that Trump put in place earlier this month. In recent weeks, major car companies such as Ford and General Motors had urged the president to exempt the industry from any further duties. A 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission, external predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%. But Trump has proceeded with the move, which is a revival of an action he first considered during his first term in the White House.  White House officials said it wanted to see US workers make more parts, not simply assemble them, and have maintained their action is pushing firms to relocate.  A day before the latest tariffs, South Korean carmaking giant Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (Â£16.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in the southern state of Louisiana. Trump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\". United Autoworkers union leader Shawn Fain, who had opposed Trump in the election, praised the president's actions, saying he was \"stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades\". Elsewhere, the head of trade group the American Automotive Policy Council, Matt Blunt, said: \"US Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the US.\"  Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Poland to suspend migrants' right to apply for asylum",
        "content": "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited the Poland-Belarus border on Saturday  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said his government will temporarily suspend the right of migrants arriving in Poland via its border with Belarus to apply for asylum. Tusk made the announcement after the controversial bill, which will allow Polish authorities to suspend this right for up to 60 days at a time, was signed into law by President Andrzej Duda. Tusk said his government would adopt the law \"without a moment's delay\" while Duda said the changes were needed to strengthen security on the country's borders. But the law has been criticized by rights groups including Human Rights Watch, which said the EU should take legal action against Poland if it was implemented. The group urged the country's parliament last month to reject the bill, saying it \"flies in the face of Poland's international and EU obligations\" and could \"effectively completely seal off the Poland-Belarus border, where Polish authorities already engage in unlawful and abusive pushbacks\". The government said previously the suspension would only be applied temporarily to people who pose a threat to state security, for example large groups of aggressive migrants trying to storm the border. Exemptions will be made for unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, the elderly or unwell, anyone exposed to \"real risk of serious harm\" by being returned and citizens of countries accused of conducting the instrumentalization of migration - like Belarus Tusk has dismissed critiques from human rights groups. \"Nobody is talking about violating human rights, the right to asylum, we are talking about not granting applications to people who illegally cross the border in groups organised by Lukashenko,\" he said in October. Since 2021, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Finland have seen a huge increase in the number of people crossing into their countries illegally from Belarus and Russia. Polish authorities have sent thousands of troops and border guards to police its border with Belarus and built a 5.5-metre-high steel fence along 186 km of the frontier where at times several thousand migrants have been left stranded. Rights groups estimate more than one hundred people have died on the borders between Belarus and Poland, Lithuania and Latvia since 2021. EU eastern flank countries and the European Commission have accused the Belarusian and Russian authorities of weaponising migration to create a new route into the EU to destabilize the bloc.

        "title": "Brazil's ex-President Bolsonaro to stand trial on coup charges",
        "content": "Ex-President Bolsonaro flew to Brasilia for the Supreme Court decision Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against current president, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, after a ruling from the country's top court. The Supreme Court's five-member panel voted unanimously in favour of the trial going ahead. It could start as early as this year, and if found guilty Bolsonaro, 70, could face years in prison.  Speaking after the court's decision, Bolsonaro told a press conference the charges against him were \"grave and baseless\". He has always denied trying to block Lula's inauguration. \"It seems they have something personal against me,\" he added in a post on X, referring to the judges.  Bolsonaro says he is the victim of \"political persecution\" aimed at preventing him from running again for president in 2026. The panel was tasked with determining whether there was enough evidence to put Bolsonaro on trial. The first to cast his vote on Wednesday was the judge heading the panel, Alexandre de Moraes. He recommended that Bolsonaro, as well as seven other former government officials described by the attorney-general as \"co-conspirators\", stand trial over the events which led up to the storming of government buildings by his supporters on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration. The seven men accused of being co-conspirators are: Alexandre Ramagem, former spy chief Adm Almir Garnier Santos, former navy commander  Anderson Torres, former security minister  Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former assistant Gen Walter Braga Netto, former defence minister  Gen Paulo SÃ©rgio Nogueira de Oliveira former defence minister  Video shows Brazil Supreme Court mass break-in. Video, 00:00:18Video shows Brazil Supreme Court mass break-in Brazil's Congress storming Bolsonaro, a former army captain and admirer of US President Donald Trump, governed Brazil from January 2019 to December 2022. He narrowly lost a presidential election run-off in October 2022 to his left-wing rival, Lula. Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat. Many of his supporters spent weeks camping outside army barracks in an attempt to convince the military to prevent Lula from being sworn in as president as scheduled on 1 January 2023. A week after Lula's inauguration, on 8 January 2023, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia, in what federal investigators say was an attempted coup. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people. Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. A federal police investigation into the riots and the events leading up to them was launched. The investigators said they had found evidence that there was \"a criminal organisation\" which had \"acted in a coordinated manner\" to keep then-President Bolsonaro in power. Their 884-page report, which was unsealed in November 2024, alleged that \"then-President Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup d'etat and eliminate the democratic rule of law\". Brazil's Attorney-General, Paulo Gonet, went even further in his report published last month, in which he accused Bolsonaro of not just being aware but of leading the criminal organisation that he says sought to overthrow Lula. According to Gonet's report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the Supreme Court justice who headed the panel which has now decided that the case should proceed to trial. Bolsonaro has always denied the allegations which he says are politically motivated and designed to stop him from running for president again. While he is already barred from running for public office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he had declared his intention to fight that ban so he could run for a second term in 2026. However, Wednesday's decision by the Supreme Court has placed a very high hurdle in his way to a possible candidacy.

        "title": "Three ways the Spring Statement could affect you and your money",
        "content": "Talk of growth forecasts and self-imposed financial rules may feel very distant from you and your life, but the Spring Statement could affect both your job and your money. Here's what it could mean for you. If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.  The changes to the benefits system, announced last week, will see some people lose support from next year, although universal credit payments are set to rise from next April. This means:  If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is Â£4,500 a year Even if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out. Overall, by 2029-30, some 3.2 million families - some current recipients and some future recipients - will see cuts, with an average loss of Â£1,720 per year once inflation is taken into account If you are on universal credit, then you could benefit. A total of 3.8 million current and future claimants will be Â£420 a year better off on average by 2029-30, after taking into account the impact of inflation Other changes to the welfare reforms also mean less money than you may have expected. For example, the government had said there would be a rise in the standard allowance for universal credit for 6.5 million people.  It will now rise to Â£106 a week, for a single claimant aged over 25 in 2029-30, rather than the Â£107 previously billed. The health element of universal credit, which is paid if your ability to work is limited,  was set be halved for new claimants to Â£50 a week in 2026-27, and will now be frozen thereafter. Ministers have said that existing claimants will be affected too with their entitlement frozen at Â£97 a week until 2029-30. The Spring Statement doesn't come in isolation. Next week, a series of household bills will rise. From 1 April, you will pay more for water, energy and your council tax. However, if you're over 21 and on the minimum wage then your hourly rate will go up to Â£12.21 an hour, from the current Â£11.44. Nonetheless, the rising cost of living has pushed many of you to your financial limit. And now the prices you pay are expected to rise at a faster pace this year than previously thought. Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%. As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.  Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve. This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be Â£500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards. Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change. There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.  Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you. For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.

        "title": "Growth forecast halved for 2025 but later years upgraded",
        "content": "Taxes may have to rise in the autumn, economists have warned, despite big welfare cuts and spending reductions in Wednesday's Spring Statement. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to meet her self-imposed rule to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending with room to spare, according to the government's official forecaster. But it has warned that global uncertainty due to the impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs could hit the UK economy and derail Reeves's plans. In that scenario, it would be difficult to cut spending further or borrow more so tax rises would likely be needed to meet her rules, experts say. \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far. And the UK's uncomfortable concoction of low economic growth and high interest rates means public borrowing can only rise so far,\" said Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics \"The inevitable conclusion is that at some point the government may have to break its election promises and raise taxes for households - the full Budget later this year will be the next flashpoint.\" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the fact that Reeves had little room for manoeuvre \"leaves you at the mercy of events\". \"We can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" he said. Reeves raised taxes for businesses in her first Budget in October, and when asked if there could again be tax rises in the Budget this autumn, she said: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\" The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year to 1%, down from its October prediction of 2%. \"I am not satisfied with these numbers,\" said Reeves, who has made growing the economy one of her key promises. However, the OBR raised its growth forecasts for the following years and Reeves said by 2029-30 the economy would be bigger compared to the forecast at the time of the Budget in October. Live: Follow the latest on the chancellor's announcement Key points from the Spring Statement at a glance Who is affected by the Pip and universal credit changes? Watch: Henry Zeffman on what you need to know...in 58 seconds Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with much speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. The two key ones are: Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament In October, the OBR said that Reeves had Â£9.9bn headroom by 2029-30 with regards to day-to-day spending - the amount left over after meeting the fiscal rule. The chancellor said that changes in the global economy had altered the picture since then and she would have missed that rule by Â£4.1bn due to an increase in government borrowing costs. However, the measures announced on Wednesday \"restored in full our headroom\" to Â£9.9bn, she said. The OBR acknowledged that risks around the global outlook had intensified since October.  \"If the US levied an additional 20% tariffs on the UK and the rest of the world, that could reduce the level of UK output next year by 1% and also wipe out the headroom that the chancellor has retained against her fiscal rules,\" the OBR's Richard Hughes told the BBC. The Â£9.9bn is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time has been Â£30bn.  Regarding the second rule, Reeves said the OBR had forecast it would be met two years early, with a headroom of Â£15.1bn by 2029-30. Looking at growth over the next few years, the OBR now expects the economy to grow by 1.9% in 2026, by 1.8% in 2027, by 1.7% in 2028 and by 1.8% in 2029. However, Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought the OBR would \"almost certainly have to cut potential growth forecasts\" in the autumn and also expected a rise in planned defence spending by 2027. \"So further tax hikes and borrowing are coming,\" he said. The chancellor said the OBR had now taken into account planning reforms and housebuilding targets the government announced in July. Housebuilding is forecast to hit a 40-year high, with these reforms expected to boost the economy by Â£6.8bn, according to the independent spending watchdog. The OBR also raised its forecast for inflation this year to 3.2% but expects the rate of price rises to fall back to the Bank of England's 2% target in 2027. Real household disposable income per person is expected to grow by an average of around 0.5% a year, the OBR said. The forecaster said stronger wage growth meant this figure was slightly higher than in its previous prediction in October. Reeves said this meant that by 2029-30 people would be on average more than  Â£500 a year better off compared with what the OBR had expected in October.

News comes\nout of Trumpâs White House at such a relentless pace that stories can seemingly vanish into the background, steamrolled by the presidentâs latest Truth post or\nexecutive order. But Signalgate,\nas this scandal has been dubbed, is the rare story with staying power.  When Trump announced a new tariff in the Oval Office this afternoon, he told a reporter who asked about Signal to âhold on one secondâ so he could find someone else who would ask him about tariffs.  Trump did end up taking questions on the Signal group chat, and the president distanced himself from the scandal. Asked if he was sure no classified material was shared, he said âthatâs what Iâve heard. I donât knowâ. It's a scaled back take, compared to what many in his administration said today - they've been adamant that no classified materials were shared.  That downplaying of the details in the group chat are what spurred The Atlantic to publish more messages from defence secretary Pete Hegseth today, Goldberg told the BBC. Weâre\npausing our live coverage for the day, but thereâs a whole lot of further\nreading you can get stuck into here: During his interview with the BBC's Sarah Smith, Jeffrey Goldberg says the Signal scandal involved two key mistakes. \"There's a widespread\nfeeling in the White House that Mike Waltz is an idiot, thatâs the word thatâs\nbeing used,\" Goldberg says of Trump's national security adviser, who inadvertently added the journalist to the group chat. \"Should\nyou, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?\" Goldberg asks. \"And\nthen the second part is obviously the ridiculous part, if youâre going to do it,\ntry not to invite national security journalists into the conversation.\" Goldberg claims the fallout from this scandal includes people at lower levels in the government \"who believe there is a double standard\".  \"If you're an air force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that theyâve obviously mishandled\nsensitive information, youâd be fired, youâd be prosecuted.  \"A lot of people feel there is a level of hypocrisy here.\" During their interview, BBC's Sarah Smith and Jeffrey Goldberg spoke about the White House's comment that tech billionaire Elon Musk would look into how Goldberg was added to the Signal group chat. Thatâs the funniest part of all. Really? Youâre going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebodyâs phone number ends up in someoneâs phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out.\" Jeffrey Goldberg \"I could save everybody a lot of time by simply saying he (National Security Adviser Mike Waltz) sent me a message request and I accepted it, I donât know what else to do.\" \"And next thing I know Iâm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States. \"Just at the technical level, in order to connect with somebody on Signal, your phone number has to be in their phone,\" Goldberg says. Goldberg tells the BBC he has met Waltz on several occasions, but he declines to comment on how well he knows him. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt spent a considerable amount of time in her briefing today criticising Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in chief of The Atlantic who was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with top US officials. Among many things, Leavitt called Goldberg an \"anti-Trump hater\" who peddles hoaxes. Speaking with the BBC, Goldberg says \"if I'm all those things, why would they invite me to the chat?\" \"They say these things about me for years... This is their move. You never defend, just attack.  \"So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I donât even get it.  When asked if he worried about the possibility of the Trump administration trying to prosecute him over the saga, he says: \"I never worry about anything like that.\" More now from Sarah Smith's interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic. In the first article on the Signal group chat, Goldberg intentially left out some details that he thought were sensitive. Today, he published many of those details. \"Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera. We felt like hmm, we disagree.\" Jeffrey Goldberg Goldberg tells the BBC he reached out to leaders in the intelligence community and asked if safety would be compromised by publishing the messages. The CIA asked him to redact a piece of information from the message and he said the magazine agreed because \"we take this sort of thing seriously and donât want anybody hurt or compromised\". \"[The CIA] didn't come back with anything substantive, some of them didnât even answer our queries, and at a certain point, the public interest comes into play,\" he says. \"And we felt like the people of the United States should read these texts from their leaders themselves and then make the decision if this was a wise thing to do, to do this on Signal, do this on a commercial non-government messaging app.\" This video can not be played âWhy did they invite me?â - Goldberg says Trump officials should accept mistake The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith spoke with The Atlantic's editor Jeffrey Goldberg in the wake of his explosive story about being added to a Signal chat group with top Trump administration officials. Today, the White House has vigorously defended the group chat, saying no war plans were shared and no classified information was texted.  Goldberg tells the BBC the text messages seem like \"sensitive, war-planning information to me\". \"This is why we put the all the information on our website, just so people can read themselves and make up their own minds,\" Goldberg says. Goldberg says the Trump administration is blaming reporters rather than \"actually acknowledging that they have a massive national security breach, and that they should just go fix it\". \"The administration is\nmore interested in calling me bad names, which is fine, they've done that for\nyears. \"I mean, that's, that's the point,\" he says. \"That's the point about leadership. Leadership, you deal with your mistakes, try to make things better, move on. But that's not the playbook here.\" The Signal chat leak \"doesn't bother me\", Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office. The president goes on to suggest that Signal may be a \"defective\" platform and \"isn't very good\".  \"Everybody uses signal, but it could be a defective platform, and we're gonna have to find that answer,\" Trump says He offers no evidence as to why he thinks the Signal app could be defective. For context, Signal is the publicly available messaging app that was used by top US officials to discuss military strikes on Houthis. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited a journalist to that group chat. President Trump is asked who was responsible for the Signal leak. \"Mike Waltz, I guess he claimed responsibly,\" Trump says about his National Security Advisor. \"I was told it was Mike.\" He adds that Waltz \"took responsibility\" and that no other of his officials are responsible.  \"Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this.\" Trump also speaks about the success of the military strike on Houthi targets, saying it was \"beyond our wildest expectations\". He says the strikes will continue \"for a long time\". Asked about the Signal scandal, Trump claims it is a \"witch hunt\" that is being overhyped by the media. He goes on to says he had \"nothing to do with it\" and \"wasn't there\", and that the US campaign against Yemen's Houthis is going well. When asked if there was classified information sent in the Signal chat, he says \"I don't know,\" but he has \"heard\" that there wasn't. \"I really don't know,\" he says. \"You'll have to ask the various people involved.\"  President Trump has just announced new tariff measures at an event inside the Oval Office.  He's now taking questions from reporters and we're expecting one or two about the Signal scandal. You can follow all the action by pressing Watch live at the of the page. We're expecting to hear from US President Donald Trump later today. He is scheduled to speak in the Oval Office about tariffs, but he usually takes questions from reporters - so expect the president to be asked about the Signal chat group scandal. Trump has previously said that nothing in the chat could have \"compromised\" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did admit a member of his team may have \"screwed up\". The president yesterday said \"there was no classified information, as I understand it\" in the messages.  Earlier today White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt re-iterated that stance. The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate has said that those involved in the Signal chat affair had made a mistake and should own up to it. âThe important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,â John Thune told CNN. When asked whether Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth should resign, the majority leader avoided answering and said that the strikes on the Houthis alluded to in the chat seemed to have been \"pretty flawless\". Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, and other members of the Trump administration, have spent a lot of time today talking about what the Signal group chat text messages were not.  They werenât âwar plansâ, they didnât include a detailed list of targets or specific military units, they didnât contain detailed flight paths or routes, and they didnât reveal intelligence sources of methods. Trump officials have tended to avoid discussion of what was actually in those messages â including timings of the strikes, military assets used and post-strike damage reports â and whether sharing those details through a commercial messaging service put American national security at risk. For an administration that regularly touts how it is restoring âcommon senseâ to government, such misdirection and semantic wordplay may seem decidedly out of step with reality.  As the political pressure continues, the administrationâs ability to hold this line will be tested. Top of the news agenda today is the release of the full Signal group chat, which the US administration has repeatedly said did not include any classified information.  The new information includes a thread of messages apparently written by defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he tells officials - and inadvertently The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg - specific timings of US strikes in Yemen. A month before the breach of Signal group chat of high-level US officials was revealed, the National Security Agency (NSA) sent out an operational security special memo to its employees to caution them about using the encrypted messaging application, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports, citing internal NSA documents. \"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application,\" the agency said in February. \"The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information.\" The memo warned that Russian hackers were using phishing scams to get access to conversations on the application and bypassing encryption. The agency also said that the application - as well as WhatsApp - were permitted for unclassified uses but not for communicating about more sensitive information, CBS reports. Since the messages were first released there's been a distinct partisan divide in the reaction from lawmakers: Democratic Senator Mark Kelly said \"this is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line,\" while Senator Ruben Gallego said \"the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing\". Some, including Gallego, have called for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi pushed this message while displaying larger print-out screenshots of the messages during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier today. Republicans, meanwhile, have by and large defended their colleauges. President Donald Trump has insisted that none of the information was classified, and \"there was nothing in there that compromised\" the operation - something reiterated by his press secretary earlier today. House Speaker Mike Johnson said the administration has \"acknowledged it was a mistake\" to add the journalist to the chat, but \"no one was jeopardised because of it\". That was echoed by Senator Ted Cruz who called it a \"screw up\" but that the Trump administration \"took responsibility\" for it. However one top Republican is among those calling for an official probe into the incident - Senator Roger Wicker said based on his knowledge, \"I would have wanted it classified\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier Secretary of State Marco Rubio just spoke to media in Jamaica, where he is on a state visit. He's asked about the Signal scandal and says it's obvious that \"someone made a big mistake and added a journalist\".  \"Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing,\" he says. Rubio downplays his role in the Signal chat group, saying he messaged to identify his point of contact, and then messaged again after the strikes were carried out to offer his congratulations. He says the information shared on Signal wasnât intended to be made public, but says the Pentagon has said none of the information threatened the lives of service members. Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent Karoline Leavitt, in her recently concluded White House press conference, presented the American public with a choice.  Who did they believe in the group-chat controversy? Jeffrey Goldberg, whom she characterised as an âanti-Trump sensationalist reporter\", or Pete Hegseth, the Senate-confirmed secretary of defence who âhonourably served our nation in uniformâ. Thatâs the kind of framing that's a red meat appeal to Donald Trumpâs base. The administration's strategy for handling this crisis is to trust that Trumpâs loyal supporters - and the Republican politicians they help elect - will stick with the president.  Such faith has carried Trump through more formidable situations than this, and White House officials seem to believe that it will do so again. There are risks to this strategy, however. While the base may keep Trump afloat, Republicans need more than their core supporters to win elections â such as state races later this year and in the 2026 congressional mid-terms.  Undecided middle-of-the-road Americans may look at the details of the text messages and be less willing trust that Hegseth is honestly assessing whether his own actions put national security at risk.  And trust, once eroded, is difficult to win back. This video can not be played Pete Hegseth reaffirms there was 'no classified information' in Signal chat Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has again denied sending war plans in the Signal chat group. Speaking to reporters from an air strip in Hawaii, Hegseth says the information in the messages released today \"doesn't look like war plans\". \"They know it's not war plans\", he says, \"there's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information\". His job, Hegseth adds \"is to provide updates in real time... that's what I did\". The messages from Hegseth, which were shared by The Atlantic, noted what time F-18 fighter aircraft were scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes would take place and in what time frame \"trigger-based\" attacks could occur. Mike Waltz criticised Joe Biden's team for email-related security conduct in the past By Jake Horton Several of the Trump officials apparently included in the Signal chat have previously criticised other people for their handling of classified information. In June 2023, Trumpâs National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who appears to have added the Atlantic journalist to the chat - criticised President Bidenâs National Security Adviser, external for sending \"top secret emails\" to a private account. In January 2023, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, who was a Fox News host at the time, criticised Biden as \"nefarious, sloppy and dumb\" after classified documents were found in his garage. Talking about the same incident, Trumpâs Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: \"Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting it's a problem, I don't care who did it.\" And earlier this month US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, when posting about government leaks, external, said that \"any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such\".

        "title": "Fertility patients sold unproven add-ons, regulator HFEA says",
        "content": "Many fertility patients in the UK are being offered unnecessary add-on treatments that have little or no proof of improving the likelihood of pregnancy, a report suggests.  Add-ons are optional, non-essential treatments some private clinics offer in addition to proven treatments, such in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). According to the regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) , 73% of 1,500 patients surveyed between September and October 2024 said they had used an add-on in their latest round of treatment. Most said they had done so based on the clinic's recommendation. And only about one in every three said the possible risks had been explained to them. HFEA director Clare Ettinghausen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"This is people themselves reporting on whether they took perhaps an additional supplement, like a vitamin tablet, or had a test or perhaps something like acupuncture.  \"We have looked at the evidence... they are not necessarily going to increase the chance of having a baby.  \"So we are worried that people are spending money unnecessarily.\" Some of the add-ons can cost thousands of pounds. And while the HFEA has no power to stop or fine clinics, it is reminding them they must give patients a clear idea of what add-ons involve, how likely they are to help and how much they cost. The regulator also has its own traffic-light rating tool, external to help patients decide.  Examples include: Genetic tests Endometrial scratching - where a small area of the womb lining is scraped to trigger processes in the hope it will help the embryo implant Assist hatching - where a small crack is created in the embryo's outer layer Overall, patients were satisfied with the care they were receiving, Ms Ettinghausen said. But the HFEA is concerned NHS patients are waiting longer than those going private. Just over one out of every two private patients started treatment within a year, compared with one out of every three NHS patients. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"It is unacceptable fertility patients are being offered unnecessary treatments that will not help them in their goal of becoming parents. \"We are working to improve access to NHS fertility services for all who need it. \"We are also currently considering advice from the HFEA about priorities for law reform covering their regulatory powers, including their potential role in digital clinics.\" Are you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

        "title": "Russia says sanctions must be lifted before Ukraine maritime ceasefire can start",
        "content": "A Russian navy vessel in the Black Sea (file photo) Russia has said some Western sanctions must be lifted before it begins a maritime ceasefire with Ukraine. Within hours of the US announcing the two sides had agreed to halt strikes in the Black Sea in separate deals, the Kremlin said it would only take place once sanctions on a number of Russian banks were lifted. The demands include revoking sanctions on the state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank and restoring the firms' access to the Swift international payment system. Overnight, Moscow launched a drone attack on the port city of Mykolaiv, Ukrainian officials said, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying the strikes were \"a clear signal\" Russia did not want peace. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the EU and its allies suspended access to Swift for a number of Russian financial institutions.  The aim was for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Reversing that decision would need EU approval, a step that would appear uncertain in light of recent European statements of support for Kyiv. A European Commission spokesperson said the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine would be one of the main conditions to lift or amend any sanctions. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump said that Russia could be trying to delay ending the war. \"I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet. I've done it over the years,\" he said in an interview with Newsmax.  The maritime ceasefire was announced by the US after three days of peace talks in Saudi Arabia. However Kyiv and Moscow later released conflicting statements on the details of the deal, including when and how it would start. Zelensky said he believed the deal did not require sanctions relief to come into force and would take effect immediately. He called the Kremlin's statement an attempt to \"manipulate\" the deals. The Black Sea has not been a central focus of fighting for some time.  In the first stages of the war, Ukraine successfully targeted Russia's fleet in its Crimean home ports and as of last summer, Ukraine said it had destroyed 28 Russian vessels. With what was left of the Russian fleet fleeing south and east to Russian and Abkhazian ports, Ukraine has been successfully exporting goods - with grain exports at near pre-war levels - via shipping which hugged the western seaboard of the Black Sea.  So any maritime ceasefire â if it comes into force â is unlikely to reshape the balance of the war that is largely being fought on the ground. But Dr Jenny Mathers, a senior professor of international politics at Aberystwyth University and expert on Russian politics, said the maritime ceasefire would provide Russia with a \"big advantage\" as it was currently struggling to export its agricultural produce. \"Ukraine has managed to get out a lot of its agricultural produce through the Black Sea, and it's managed to successfully target Russian shipping, so Russia doesn't use the Black Sea at the moment,\" Dr Mathers said. The Black Sea Grain Initiative was struck in 2022, allowing safe passage of commercial ships travelling to and from Ukraine, with UN officials helping Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets in return.  Russia withdrew from the agreement in summer 2023, arguing that financial sanctions were hindering its exports, and said it would view any vessel bound for Ukraine as a potential military target.  The UN said on Wednesday that freedom of navigation in the Black Sea was a \"crucial contribution to global food security and supply chains\". A spokesperson said the UN was working with Russia to facilitate its food and fertiliser exports.  Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine? Why Trump is struggling to secure fast ceasefire in Ukraine 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine. Here's how I really feel about a ceasefire' Where a maritime ceasefire could make a difference is by protecting Ukrainian ports from Russian air strikes. \"For us, a ceasefire is primarily a cessation of shelling of civilian port infrastructure,\" said Dmytro Pletenchuk, the Ukrainian navy spokesperson. \"As of now, we're in control of the situation at sea; in the Black Sea, in the Azov Sea, and in the waters surrounding temporarily occupied Crimea. That's why for us, the Ukrainian navy, this situation would not really change anything.\" After announcing the agreement on Tuesday, Washington said all parties would continue working towards a \"durable and lasting peace\", adding that the agreement would reopen an important trade route. Ukraine and Russia also committed to \"develop measures\" to implement a previously agreed ban on attacking each other's energy infrastructure, the White House said. The Black Sea is located south of Ukraine and to the west of Russia, and is also bordered by Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Georgia. It is also bordered by parts of Russian-occupied Ukraine - including Crimea.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Mike Waltz says he takes 'full responsibility' for group chat leak US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for a group chat in which high-ranking officials planned military strikes in Yemen in the company of a  journalist who was inadvertently added. \"I take full responsibility. I built the group,\" Waltz told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was \"embarrassing\".  President Donald Trump and US intelligence chiefs have downplayed the security risks and said no classified material was shared. But Democrats and some Republicans have called for an investigation into what several lawmakers have described as a major breach. Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he was accidentally added to the Signal chat by a user named Mike Waltz. In his article that broke the story, external he says he saw classified military plans for US strikes in Yemen, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck. That content was held back from the piece. This video can not be played Watch: Key reactions to reports of a leaked group chat involving Trump officials   Waltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but - contradicting Trump - he said a member of his staff was not responsible and another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place. \"We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened,\" Waltz continued, adding that Goldberg's number had not been on his phone. \"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,\" Waltz said, adding that he had spoken to Elon Musk for help in finding out what happened. When pressed further by show host Laura Ingraham on how the number got added, Waltz responded: \"Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it â¦ gets sucked in. It gets sucked in.\" Follow the latest on this story Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling Disdain for Europe in US Signal chat horrifies EU President Trump has played down the incident, calling it a \"glitch\" that had \"no impact at all\" operationally.  Speaking to Newsmax, Trump said somebody who worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level had Goldberg's phone number. US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that any classified information was shared in the message chain. But Democrats questioned that, given the reporting from Goldberg, and asked them to release all the information if it was not classified. The Signal group chat also included accounts identified as being Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Mark Warner, Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: \"This Signal chat situation sheds light on a sloppy and grossly incompetent national security strategy from the Trump administration.\" This video can not be played Watch: 'It shouldn't happen again' - Americans react to Signal group chat leak In his reporting, Goldberg said the officials on the chat had discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes. \"Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,\" the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March. He added his team was working with the defence and state departments \"to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans\" - at Trump's request. At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\" The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\" What is the Signal messaging app and how secure is it? Five takeaways from Signal chat   This video can not be played Watch: President Trump says he will 'look into' government use of Signal messaging app The revelation has sent shockwaves through Washington, prompting a lawsuit and questions about why high-ranking officials discussed such sensitive matters on a potentially vulnerable civilian app. Some national security experts have argued that the leak was a major operational lapse, and archive experts warned that it violated laws on presidential record keeping. American Oversight, non-partisan watchdog group, sued the officials who participated in the chat for alleged violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act. The group said that by setting the chat to automatically delete messages, the group violated a law requiring White House officials to submit their records to the National Archives. The National Security Agency warned employees only last month of vulnerabilities in Signal, according to documents obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS.

But the government's watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, warned that the margin was \"very small\", with much that could derail the UK economy - not least US trade tariffs. There was much else in Reeves'  announcement, too - including benefit cuts and a reduced short-term growth forecast. For a complete round-up, read here, while our economics editor Faisal Islam's analysis is here. We're closing our live coverage now, and will be back tomorrow. Thanks for reading. By Anthony Reuben Earlier, the chancellor told MPs that the OBR â which makes forecasts for the government â predicted that changes to planning rules would \"help build over 1.3 million homes in the UK over the next five years, taking us within touching distance of delivering our manifesto promise to build 1.5 million homes in England in this Parliament\". In a press release, the government said that things like the Â£2bn invested in social and affordable housing this week, which was not reflected in the OBR forecast, would help with reaching its target. But Rachel Reeves was clear that the forecast was for new homes across the UK - while her target was for England only. Paul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC's Politics Live that once you exclude homes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, \"itâs not quite as close touching distance as it might sound â I think weâre more like 400,000 rather than 200,000 out\". By Robert Cuffe The Department for Work and Pensions earlier published , externalits impact and equality assessment , externalof the government's welfare reforms, which suggest that the changes to benefits could lead to 250,000 more people in poverty* by 2030, including 50,000 children, increasing the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage points. The vast majority (96%) of families that lose financially are estimated to have someone with a disability in the household.  And the DWP estimate that one-in-five (20%) households who report having someone with a disability in the household will lose out.  This assessment does not account for any changes in employment that might be caused by the welfare changes or funding for employment support.  Overall, DWP forecasts that 3.2 million families will lose out from the benefits changes, losing around Â£1,700 a year on average.  Losses will be concentrated among those who are no longer eligible for Pip (roughly 800,000 people, losing Â£4,500 a year on average) or those not eligible for the health component of universal credit (losing on average Â£3,000 a year). Some will lose both benefits.  But there will also be 3.8 million families expected to be better off as a result of the changes. But their gains are smaller on average (Â£420 a year).  The biggest winners are the roughly 370,000 people who might not have qualified for the UC Health Element under the old Work Capability Assessment plans but will under the government's new rules (gaining roughly Â£2,600 a year).  Many more families will gain from the increase in the standard allowance, but that is worth a lot less - around Â£265 a year to roughly 3.9 million households.  *Relative poverty (income below 60% of the median that year), after housing costs Douglas FraserScotland business and economy editor Though hardly her top priority in the Spring Statement, the chancellor has laid down several challenges to the Scottish government at\nHolyrood.  One is to handle more than Â£400m in cuts to devolved welfare\nspend, implied by the size of the block grant from the Treasury to Holyrood at\nthe end of the five-year spending plan.  Will Scottish ministers try to mitigate the cuts in Personal\nIndependence Payments in its devolved Scottish equivalent, the Adult Disability\nPayment?   If so, what else will be cut, or could the funds come from higher\nincome tax?  Another is to apply a similar level of cuts to other public\nservices, if the current trajectory of block grant funding is followed over\nthose five years.   By 2029-30, the figures show a drop of Â£700m in day-to-day\nspending compared with October's figures.  The Fraser of Allander economic institute at Strathclyde\nUniversity goes further, saying the total reduction in real terms day-to-day\nfunding for Holyrood is close to Â£900m by the end of the decade â though\nthereâs a lot of uncertainty around such figures.  So will Scottish ministers reduce the size of the civil\nservice, for instance, using its Â£200m share of a \"transformation fund\"?\nAdopting artificial intelligence to make services more efficient? Will it\nde-regulate where it can, and match the ambition for house-building?  The better news is that Holyrood has gained Â£28m in block\ngrant for the financial year starting next month. Not a lot within this Spring Statement, but itâs something. Peter CoulterBBC News NI This video can not be played O'Neill and Little Pengelly react to chancellor's Spring Statement Northern Irelandâs First Minister Michelle OâNeill calls Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement a \"macho agenda\" at a time when the public sector is \"on its\nknees\", and the health service is in need of investment. \"This is a time for our own administration to fight back\nhard against this militarisation agenda,\" she adds. \"This does not serve the interests of the people here.\" Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly says the\nchancellor needs to change course and argues that Reeves is \"punishing people\nwho are least capable of being able to take that burden\". Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor There is much that the UK Labour government is doing that\nmakes life more difficult for their Scottish party, which faces crucial Holyrood\nelections next year. The Spring Statement confirms substantial cuts to welfare\nspending over the next few years, which could either reduce payments to Scottish\nclaimants - or reduce the cash available for the Scottish government to spend on\nthe elements of welfare spending that are devolved. Many Labour MSPs admit this is a hard sell, even though\nthere is also new investment in helping some people off benefits and into work. They are getting complaints from anxious constituents,\neven those whose benefits are secure and will not lose a penny. Itâs particularly tricky because UK ministers have\nalready made cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners which Scottish\nministers are working to offset. The SNP is also working on plans to end the two-child cap\non access to benefits which UK ministers have, so far, said is unaffordable. It is easier for Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar to\nsell increased spending on defence as an investment that will benefit jobs and\nthe economy in Scotland. But there is also a constituency in Scottish Labour\nthat is more uneasy. The former party leader Richard Leonard has described more\nspending on weapons and less of welfare as a cause for \"despair\". Adam FlemingNewscast presenter We've had a few hours to go through all the graphs, documents and\ncharts that come with something like the chancellor's Spring Statement, which\nmeans we'll be ready for a live edition of the BBC's daily news podcast\nNewscast shortly. The main things Iâve noticed is that chancellorâs numbers add up\nbecause of some tight spending plans towards the end of the Parliament and an\nassumption that fuel duty will go up - which it never does.  And the Office for\nBudget Responsibility say this could all be blown up next week if Donald Trump\nputs import taxes on goods from the UK (which the government say theyâre\nnegotiating to avoid).  It gives this a slightly theoretical feel, all while the\nplanned cuts to disability benefits will feel real to those that experience\nthem. Weâre live now on the BBC Sounds Live News Stream and the BBC NewsYouTube channel , externalto break it all down with Chris Mason,\nFaisal Islam, and Dharshini David. Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent The chancellor is keen to emphasise the governmentâs\nambitious housebuilding target (read more on that here). But first-time buyers will be disappointed to see official\nforecasts that show property prices continuing to rise. The average house price is forecast to rise from about Â£265,000\nat the end of last year, to Â£295,000 in 2029, according to the Office for\nBudget Responsibility. Each year, property prices are expected to go up by about\n2.5% on average, roughly in line with wage\nrises. The OBR says planning reforms will increase the number of\nhomes by 0.5%, and will lead to prices being 0.8% lower in 2029 than they would\nhave otherwise been. But that doesnât mean house prices will fall; they will\nrise, it says. Faisal IslamEconomics editor If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could leave to a\ndowngrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the chancellorâs Â£9.9bn headroom which\nremains in place as a result of her Spring Statement measures announced today,\nthe Office for Budget Responsibility chairman tells me.  \"If the US levied an additional 20% tariffs on the UK and the rest of the\nworld, that could reduce the level of UK output next year by 1% and also\nwipe out the headroom that the chancellor has retained against her fiscal\nrules,\" Richard Hughes says.  He says there are many areas of uncertainty around the OBR forecast.  \"Interest rates are higher which puts greater pressure on both businesses,\nbut also the public finances, and the risks to the outlook are very elevated.  \"Thereâs uncertainty about the UKâs productivity performance, thereâs\nuncertainty around the future path of interest rates which have been very\nvolatile, and also great uncertainty about the trade outlook.\"  Hughes also responds to criticism that the OBR has become too powerful, with\naccusations that decisions the economic forecaster makes lead to big changes in\ngovernment policy.  \"The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament legislation,\nand those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of\ngovernment policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on course to meet\nher fiscal rules,\" he says.  \"The chancellor chooses the policy she wants to implement, she chooses the\nrules she sets for herself. If she wants to change those rules, she can change\nthose rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change those\npolicies.  \"Sheâs in charge of Â£1.5 trillion of spending and Â£1.5 trillion of receipts.\nThat gives her Â£3 trillion worth of choices. She made the choices she made in\nthis Spring Statement. And we assess their implications for the macro economy.\" This video can not be played OBR chair: Trump tariffs on could halve growth and wipe out headroom Michael RaceBusiness reporter So far it looks like Rachel Reeves \"has managed to pull off\nher rebalancing act without overly spooking the markets\", according to Danni\nHewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis. As we've reported, Reeves says her self-imposed borrowing rules are \"not-negotiable\". Such\nrules are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets, which the\ngovernment relies on to fund its plans. If markets arenât convince by a governmentâs\ncreditworthiness, theyâll charge more to lend money through higher interest\nrates. Hewson says the main stock indexes on the London Stock\nExchange both \"wobbled\" while the chancellor was speaking, but have since\nrecovered.  The cost of borrowing over 10 years for the government has edged\nlower too. By Ben Chu Last Autumn, the chancellor left herself with Â£9.9bn of âheadroomâ against her chosen fiscal rules â basically a flexibility buffer on borrowing. The governmentâs official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), now says that buffer was wiped out by a projected rise in the governmentâs borrowing costs over the Parliament, relative to last Autumn. So to plug the gap and stick to her rules, Rachel Reeves has announced cuts in welfare spending and pencilled in further cuts to public service spending. The OBR also estimates the governmentâs planning reforms â enabling more building â will help by boosting the overall economy and tax revenues. When you add these impacts together, the OBR says the chancellor will have Â£9.9bn headroom â which is exactly where she started. But remember, this is all\nbased on forecasts and this is still\na relatively small amount in an economy that spends Â£1 trillion a year (and\nraises around the same in tax) so it could easily be wiped out again in the\nfuture, if the economic outlook deteriorates.  This video can not be played What are Rachel Reeves's rules for the economy? Chancellor Rachel Reeves has finished a news conference explaining her Spring Statement on the government's plans for the UK economy. (In case you missed it, read a breakdown of the main takeaways from her appearance in Parliament earlier.) Here are the main points from the news conference: Fiscal rules are non-negotiable, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says, as she addresses reporters at the news conference in Downing Street. \"People should have no doubt about my commitment and how seriously I take the fiscal rules, as I said today they are non-negotiable,\" the chancellor says. As a reminder, some people - including some MPs in her own party - say Reeves should loosen her self-imposed rules, in order to give herself room to avoid spending cuts. Before ending the news conference, Reeves is asked about taxes. The chancellor says she had to ask businesses to pay more in tax back in October, during the Budget, which was necessary to repair public services. The chancellor goes on to say the previous government did not respect taxpayers' money. She says for \"too long\" people's money that's paid into taxes has not been respected. The Financial Times now asks Reeves about the possibility of US tariffs and how \"damaging\" a \"full scale global trade war\" would be for the UK.  The chancellor says the OBR today set out some different scenarios - adding that everyone was \"very pleased\" when the prime minister went to Washington recently for initial meetings.  Referring to Trump's previous term, Reeves says trade and investment flows between the UK and the US \"increased\".  \"We'll continue to make the case for free and open trade.\" Rachel Reeves is then asked by Bloomberg about IFS comments that the government's headroom is limited, meaning taxes may need to be increased in future - as our business reporter explains.  Reeves responds that she inherited the lowest headroom a chancellor has ever been faced with.  She says that she managed to increase this headroom by around 50% in Autumn last year.  Since then, higher government borrowing costs have eroded much of that progress. But Reeves adds that today she has restored this headroom in full. The chancellor says this proves people should have no doubt about her commitment to the fiscal rules and the need for stability. Reeves is asked by a journalist from The Sun if the National Insurance increase (she announced in October) is actually a tax on working people.  Reeves replies that wages are rising at twice the rate of inflation. The national living wage is going up and inflation is coming down, Reeves says. People are starting to see extra money in their pay packets and living standards are going up, she claims.  The next question is from the ITV, who asks the chancellor whether her fiscal plans and self-imposed rules are punishing the most vulnerable. In response, the chancellor says there is \"nothing progressive and nothing Labour\" about losing control of the public finances - which she says is what the previous Tory government did. Markets impose discipline, Reeves adds, saying it's important to provide an anchor. Reeves says today the government is spending Â£105bn per year on debt interest costs - which is more than the government spends on defence, the ministry of justice and the home office combined.  \"This government wants to reduce debt, and reduce the deficit,\" she adds. The BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam about the OBR's assessment that many will be pushed into poverty as a result of the welfare cuts.  Reeves responds that the OBR set out that they haven't accounted for those who currently receive benefits but who will go into work.  Faisal then asks second question on speculation that the Digital Services Tax could be abolished and could she justify a \"tax giveaway\" for the biggest tech multinationals.  The chancellor says the Digital Service Tax was supposed to be temporary until there was a global agreement.  She underlines that the government believes companies should pay tax in the countries they operate - and the views on that \"have not changed\".  This video can not be played Rachel Reeves begins by setting out the government's mission and touts some of its achievements, including increasing breakfast club numbers and raising the minimum wage. She observes, though, that global instability is hampering growth across the world, and admits that the cost of living crisis is \"still very real\" in the UK.  In this climate, Reeves notes that the country needs to spend more on defence, and repeats her refrain that Labour is \"going further and faster\" on this.  The chancellor's statement is only brief, as she reiterates some of the figures behind the government's new measures - such as plans to build 1.5 million new homes - which she set out earlier on today.

        "title": "Sentebale: Harry leaves African charity he co-founded",
        "content": "Dr Sophie Chandauka and Prince Harry together at a Sentebale event in 2024 The Duke of Sussex has resigned from a charity he set up after a row between the trustees and the chair of its board. Prince Harry co-founded Sentebale in 2006 in honour of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, to help people in southern Africa living with HIV and Aids. He stepped down with his co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, and the board of trustees because its relationship with chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka \"broke down beyond repair\" after she was asked to resign and took legal action.  Dr Chandauka said she reported the trustees to the UK Charity Commission and had \"blown the whistle\" about issues including abuse of power, bullying, sexism and racism. The Charity Commission said it was \"aware of concerns about the governance\" of Sentebale and is looking into them. In a joint statement, the duke and Prince Seeiso said they were resigning from their roles with \"heavy hearts\" and in \"solidarity with the board of trustees\". \"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" they said. They said the trustees \"acted in the best interest of the charity\" by asking Dr Chandauka to step down, but that her decision to take legal action to retain her position was \"further underscoring the broken relationship\". They added they would be sharing their concerns with the Charity Commission \"as to how this came about\". Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Dr Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West described their decision as \"nothing short of devastating\" for all of them. They said they had lost trust and confidence in the chairwoman but her legal action to block them from removing her meant they had no other option than to resign. They said this was in the \"best interest of the charity\", as it could not take on the \"legal and financial burden\" of the lawsuit. Prince Harry co-founded the charity in 2006 In response, Dr Chandauka said her work at Sentebale had been \"guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all\". \"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,\" she said.  This, she said, was the \"story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [discrimination against black women] - and the coverup that ensued\". Her work with the charity was \"not a vanity project from which I can resign when I am called to account\", she added.  She said the High Court had accepted her application to hear her case.  The trustees and princes have not responded directly to her allegations. Dr Chandauka, a corporate finance lawyer, had previously served on Sentebale's board between 2009 and 2015 before becoming chairwoman, according to the charity's website. She has worked for companies such as Morgan Stanley, Meta and Virgin Money, and was appointed an MBE for her contributions to diversity in business in 2021. The charity itself said it had \"not received resignations from either Royal Patron\", but it did confirm a \"restructuring\" of its board on Tuesday. It said it was looking to bring in more experts \"with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebale's transformation agenda\". The charity added that it had announced plans last April to move from being a development organisation addressing the impact of HIV and Aids on children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana to \"one that is addressing issues of youth health, wealth and climate resilience in Southern Africa\". \"The recalibration of the board is, therefore, part of Sentebale's ambitious transformation agenda,\" the charity added. The Charity Commission said it was \"aware of concerns\" over Sentebale's governance, adding: \"We are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.\" Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

        "title": "South Korea: Death toll in 'worst ever' wildfires rises to 24",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Historic Buddhist temple burns in South Korea wildfires At least 24 people have been killed as multiple wildfires continue to ravage South Korea's south-east region.  Most of the victims are in their 60s and 70s, authorities say, adding that some 26 people are injured - with 12 in critical condition. More than 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. The \"unprecedented\" crisis is \"rewriting the record books for the worst wildfires in our nation's history\", acting president Han Duck-soo has said. The fires gutted a 1,300-year-old temple in Uiseong city, where many cultural relics were removed and transported to safer ground. The fires started in Sancheong county on Friday and later spread to Uiseong county. Fuelled by strong and dry winds, they spread to the neighbouring counties of Gyeongbuk, Uiseong, Andong, Cheongsong, Yeongyang and Sancheong. On Tuesday, the national fire agency raised the crisis to the highest fire response level. On Wednesday, a  firefighting helicopter crashed in the mountains of Uiseong, killing the pilot. Officials are investigating the cause. Thousands of firefighters and about 5,000 military personnel have been deployed to contain the flames, as well as helicopters from the US military stationed in Korea. Wildfires are relatively uncommon in South Korea. The current fires are already the deadliest in its history. About 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) of forest have also been destroyed, making the fires the third largest in South Korea's history in terms of area. More than 23,000 people have been evacuated One resident of a village in Andong told BBC Korean: \"Our house has completely burned down. It was almost completely collapsed.\"  Elsewhere in Andong, people sheltering at an elementary school were told to leave quickly as the fire was spread by gusty winds. A 30-year-old man living in Uiseong said: \"Both the upstairs and next door houses were burned down.  This area is full of grandparents. They have lived here their whole lives, and when their houses burn down, they have nowhere to go.\" In the city of Uiseong, the fire destroyed the Gounsa temple - one of the largest temples in the province built in 618 AD. A 68-year-old monk said he was \"devastated\" when he heard that about the destruction of the Gounsa temple. \"We will do our best to restore the function of the temple,\" he told AFP news agency. A Buddhist architectural structure deemed a national treasure from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) was also destroyed, forestry authorities confirmed. In Andong, truck driver Lee Seung-joo said he saw the mountains burn as he drove by. \"It was like the apocalypse,\" the 39-year-old said, according to AFP.  Acting president Han said strong winds were still hampering firefighting and rescue efforts. \"We were desperately hoping for rain today or tomorrow to help extinguish the flames,\" Han added.  No rain was forecast for the region on Wednesday and only a small amount - five to 10mm - expected on Thursday, according to the Korea Meteorological Administration. South Korea has been experiencing drier than normal conditions with less rainfall than average. There have already been 244 wildfires this year - 2.4 times more than the same period last year. The government also promised to strengthen enforcement against illegal burning -one of the main causes of wildfires - and crack down on individual carelessness.

        "title": "South Sudan clashes: UN fears civil war as barrel bombs dropped in Upper Nile",
        "content": "The White Army militia fought alongside Vice-President Riek Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 Barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid have been used in airstrikes in South Sudan as escalating violence pushes the world's newest country to the brink of another civil war, the UN has said. The comments by Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, follow recent fighting between the army and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, at a military base in the northern town of Nasir in oil-rich Upper Nile State. Since the White Army overran the base, there had been persistent aerial bombardment causing \"significant casualties and horrific burns\", he said. \"A conflict would erase all the hard-won gains made since the 2018 peace deal was signed,\" he warned. \"It would devastate not only South Sudan but the entire region, which simply cannot afford another war,\" Mr Haysom said, external. The government has not responded to the barrel bomb allegations. President Salva Kiir and his rival Vice-President Riek Machar agreed in August 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence. In early March, several of Machar's most senior allies were arrested by security forces, which his allies called a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal. This followed the clashes between the military and the White Army, which fought alongside Machar during the civil war that erupted in 2013 - not long after the country had gained its independence from Sudan. \"In retaliation, communities across Upper Nile are being subjected to persistent aerial bombardment using devices, barrel bombs, allegedly containing a highly flammable liquid that acts as an accelerant on explosion,\" Mr Haysom said. \"These indiscriminate attacks on civilians are causing significant casualties and horrific injuries, especially burns.\" Such allegations were first made last week by local leaders in Upper Nile. James Gatluak Lew, Nasir county commissioner, told the BBC that state forces and their allies had carried out \"chemical bombardments\". Local media reported that ethyl acetate, a highly flammable chemical compound, was found at the attack sites. In an earlier interview with the BBC, Edmund Yakani, the head of a local non-governmental organisation, said he had heard similar reports. Eyewitnesses, including local community leaders and business informants, had told his Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (CEPO) about the use of \"unusual weapons\", he said. Government spokesman Michael Makuei confirmed there had been a military operation in Upper Nile last week, insisting \"the bombardment was strictly against White Army positions and did not harm civilians\". But Mr Haysom said civilians, including women and children, had been greatly affected, with an estimated 63,000 people forced to flee their homes. He added that such violence was escalating as the country drew closer to elections, expected next year. \"Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\" he said. The UN mission, which oversees an estimated 18,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, was engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy to try and prevent a return to civil war, Mr Haysom added. Meanwhile, Machar has accused neighbouring Uganda of violating the UN arms embargo on South Sudan by conducting airstrikes in the country. In a letter seen by the Reuters news agency and addressed to the UN, the African Union and the regional bloc Igad, Machar said Uganda's military intervention in South Sudan had violated the peace deal. \"The Ugandan forces are currently taking part in air strikes against civilians in counties of Nasir, Longechuk and Ulang in Upper Nile State, and Akobo County in Jonglei State,\" it said. Earlier this month, Uganda said it had deployed troops to South Sudan at the request of President Kiir's government, though Juba has denied this.

Life expectancy in Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world, increased by 19 years (from 46 to 65) from 2000 to 2019 - mostly due to reductions in mortality from HIV, TB and malaria, and declines in childhood diseases. What does this very rapid demographic change mean for governments, policy planners and ordinary people now living so much longer?

        "title": "JD Vance to accompany wife on Greenland trip",
        "content": "Denmark has welcomed changes to a Greenland trip by US Vice-President JD Vance and his wife Usha, which has been reduced to a visit of just a US space base. Earlier this week, it was announced that Usha Vance would spend several days in Greenland, visiting the capital Nuuk and attending cultural events like a popular annual dogsled race.  The White House said on Tuesday that JD Vance would join his wife in Greenland but that the couple would only spend a day there visiting the US Pituffik Space Base, on the north-western coast. US President Donald Trump has continued his threats of taking over Greenland, a Danish semi-autonomous territory, saying on Wednesday: \"We're going to have to have it\". \"We need Greenland for international safety and security,\" Trump added. Although JD Vance will become the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland,  a visit to a US base is less controversial than the original plan for his wife's visit, which Greenland's acting head of government Mute Egede called a \"provocation\". Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that the decision was \"very positive\" and that Denmark had \"nothing against\" the Americans visiting their own base. Rasmussen also said it was a \"masterful spin in many ways, to make [the US] look like they're escalating when they're actually deescalating.\" The revised programme will also likely reduce the risk of the Vances being met with protests by local residents.  In recent weeks hundreds of people have taken part in demonstrations against the US, with some holding placards reading \"Respect international agreements\" and \"Yankee go home\". Earlier in March, Greenland's leading political parties issued a joint statement to condemn Trump's \"unacceptable behaviour\".  Outgoing Prime Minister Mute B Egede wrote on Facebook that his country would \"never be the USA and we Greenlanders will never be Americans... Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.\" People took part in a demonstration outside the US consulate in Nuuk earlier in March On Wednesday morning, Greenland media reported that several armoured cars which had arrived on the island in preparation for Usha Vance's visit were being loaded back on an American military plane. Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest and a military presence there since World War Two. The Pituffik Space Base, located in the north-west of Greenland, supports missile warning, air defence and space surveillance missions.  In a video posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland. He is joining her because he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself\".  He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\". He added that the Trump administration wanted to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".  It is unclear if Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz is still scheduled to visit. The BBC has reached out to the White House for confirmation. Is Greenland For Sale? US president Donald Trump says he wants the US to take over Greenland. Many people think it will never happen. But could it? If so, how? This video can not be played Watch: Danish journalist on what Greenlanders think about Trump's comments Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticised the visit.  He said it was \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.  The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.  \"Disrespecting the people of Greenland by saying the US will acquire it 'one way or the other' is unhelpful and counter-productive as a tactic,\" he added.  According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.

        "title": "University of Sussex fined £585,000 in transgender free speech row",
        "content": "The University of Sussex has been fined Â£585,000 by the higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), for failing to uphold freedom of speech. The OfS investigation started with the case of Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues. The OfS said the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to \"positively represent trans people\", could lead to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. The University of Sussex plans to legally challenge the OfS findings, vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil said. Describing the judgement as an \"unreasonably absolutist definition of free speech\", the university said the ruling would leave institutions \"powerless to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech\". The OfS, it added, had pursued a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\" against it.  Universities UK, which represents 141 institutions, said it would be writing to the OfS to clarify what would represent a breach of freedom of speech rules. Chief executive Vivienne Stern said the University of Sussex ruling raised concerns about how universities can balance freedom of speech with other legal duties, like preventing harassment and hate speech. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said free speech and academic freedom were \"non-negotiables\" in universities. \"I have been clear that where those principles are not upheld, robust action will be taken,\" she said. \"If you go to university, you must be prepared to have your views challenged, hear contrary opinions and be exposed to uncomfortable truths.  \"We are giving the OfS stronger powers on freedom of speech so students and academics are not muzzled by the chilling effect demonstrated in this case.\" The OfS was given the power to issue fines where freedom of speech was not upheld at a university in January. Arif Ahmed, the OfS director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, said the decision to fine the university had followed a thorough investigation. It found, he said, that the policy had meant staff feared disciplinary action and that Prof Stock had changed the way she taught her course as a result. Dr Ahmed added that the OfS was \"concerned that a chilling effect may have caused many more students and academics at the university to self-censor\". The regulator said the Trans and Non-Binary Equality Policy Statement issued by the University of Sussex was looked at in the context of existing legal duties on freedom of speech, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights. In its report, the OfS found four elements of the policy to be \"concerning\". These included a requirement for course materials to \"positively represent trans people and trans lives\" and an assertion that \"transphobic propagandaâ¦ [would] not be tolerated\". Kathleen Stock has required security guards to ensure her safety Another part of the policy highlighted by the regulator said \"transphobic abuse\" would be a serious disciplinary offence for staff and students. It also looked at the management and governance of the university around freedom of speech. Prof Stock faced protests on the university campus after she published a book questioning whether gender identity was more \"socially significant\" than biological sex. Posters were put up on the campus calling for her to be sacked, and students turned up with placards at an open day. Prof Stock rejected accusations that she was transphobic and described the experience to the BBC as a \"surreal anxiety dream\". She resigned from her university post in 2021 and was awarded an OBE for services to education. The fine is the largest issued to a university and is likely to be seen as an intention to hold the line over the expression of legal views. In a strongly worded statement, the University of Sussex said the regulator had been determined to make an example of its case and \"entrench an extreme libertarian free speech position\". It added there had been no \"substantive engagement\" other than via written correspondence, and it accused the regulator of pursuing a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\". The policy at the heart of the investigation had been adapted from a template, according to the university, and had since been changed.

        "title": "Spring Statement: Reeves to make further welfare cuts but boost defence",
        "content": "This video can not be played Rachel Reeves: A strong economy depends on strong defence Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to make further cuts to welfare benefits and government departments in her Spring Statement on Wednesday. The government announced big welfare spending reductions last week but the chancellor is set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has assessed that changes to benefits will save Â£3.4bn in 2029/30 rather than the Â£5bn claimed by ministers. The chancellor faces pressure over the performance of the economy, with growth remaining sluggish. But Reeves will argue the UK has to \"move quickly in a changing world\" and will confirm a Â£2.2bn increase in defence spending. The chancellor will set out her latest plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement at 12:30 GMT, and will cite uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine war and US tariffs threatening to upend global trade. Reeves, who ruled out tax rises in the statement, has already announced several spending cuts. But late on Tuesday, it emerged that she would widen her cuts to welfare after the OBR, which monitors the government's spending plans, estimated the already-announced welfare system reforms would not save the Â£5bn as planned. The reforms include stricter tests for personal independence (Pip) payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants. But it is understood the OBR assessed that many claimants facing losing health-related benefit payments would instead claim for more severe conditions.  The government did not deny reports, first carried by The Times, external, that the chancellor would make further cuts to try to make up some of the shortfall. Some Labour MPs who stayed publicly loyal and had difficult conversations with anxious constituents and annoyed activists have privately expressed frustration at the news. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is in charge of welfare reforms In her Spring Statement, Reeves will say she is \"proud\" of what Labour has delivered in its nine months in power. She will attempt to put national security at the heart of her plan to \"kickstart economic growth\", saying the increase in defence spending is \"not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too\". \"This moment demands an active government stepping up to secure Britain's future... We need to go further and faster to kickstart growth, protect national security and make people better off through our plan for change.\" Live: Follow the latest on the chancellor's announcement Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement 'As a student, Â£800 a month is quite tight' Analysis: Low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown budgetary numbers off course What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules? The increased funding will be invested in advanced technologies, including new energy weapons on Royal Navy ships. It will also be used to provide better homes for military families by refurbishing the defence estate, and help fund upgrades to infrastructure at Naval Base Portsmouth. The government announced earlier this month that it would cut the foreign aid budget to increase military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027. \"As defence spending rises, I want the whole country to feel the benefits,\" the chancellor will say. But some economists have argued the increase in defence spending will have a limited impact on economic growth. Low economic growth and higher interest rates on government borrowing in recent months have made it harder for Reeves to stick to her self-imposed and \"non-negotiable\" rules on borrowing and debt. These rules are not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending, and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. Helen Miller, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Reeves had left \"a tiny margin\" in the Budget. \"At that point in time, you could have said 'don't do that - give yourself a bigger margin' would have been a sensible thing to do,\" Ms Miller said. \"Now she's done it and, having put so much emphasis on the rules being non-negotiable, I think it would be very difficult for her to come back and say 'actually, at the first time of being tested, I'm going to let my fiscal rules be broken'.\" The OBR will publish a new economic forecast after the Spring Statement, where it is widely expected the watchdog will lower its growth expectations. Official figures estimate the economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, with it shrinking by 0.1% in January. When an economy is growing slowly - or contracting - businesses might not take on more workers or give pay rises. Lower profits mean firms pay less in tax, which funds government spending. Ahead of her statement, Reeves has sought to blame the worsening state of the public finances on a global rise in borrowing costs. Economic uncertainty, partly related to the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, have been blamed for the cost of government borrowing rising across the world. However, critics have said the UK's higher borrowing costs are in part down to Labour's economic policies and the country's economic outlook. Long-term government borrowing costs over a period of 10 years continued to rise on Tuesday to hit just below 4.8%. Your Voice, Your BBC News: What questions do you have about the Spring Statement?

Mr Lovell was presented with an \"employee of the month\" award by the shopping centre More than one million people saw an online post about his fix via the Dull Men's Club group, gaining more than 50,000 \"likes\" on Facebook. \"The fix wasn't even for the benefit of McDonald's as some people claim,\" he said. \"It was for me, and anyone else that would have noticed.\" He added: \"Sharing it was just about the mundane absurdity.\" Thanking Mr Lovell on social media, White Rose Shopping Centre said: \"We hold our hands up, this one is on us.  \"Thank you Steve, our March employee of the month, for your selfless work - we're lovin' it.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire Listen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

        "title": "BBC – Organizing music for organic discovery",
        "content": " Details on how we organised thousands of tracks to build a music discovery service that lets you find your next favourite song from BBC Introducing acts. Orbit is our pilot for a music discovery service that lets you find your next favourite song by exploring recently played tracks from BBC Introducing â the BBCâs platform for unsigned and undiscovered music. Every track is a crossroads where you have to decide with your ears: do you want to find out what youâre listening to, or do you want to try a related track? You can quickly move through the spectrum of musical genres, discovering what interests you and moving past what doesnât. Thereâs no AI and no recommendation algorithms â you decide. This article looks at how we organise music tracks behind the scenes to allow this kind of navigation. The other article in this series details the associated UX challenges. During a 6-month research project on young people and their music, podcast, and audio habits we found that they felt that music discovery was not intentional anymore: it just happened to them through algorithmic recommendations or, as they browse social media. As a response, we showed them a prototype where music played with no information â no image, no metadata â and they had to make choices based on what they heard using a joystick to go from track to track. It was a blunt instrument designed to get a reaction. The reaction was very positive! Participants liked that it required them to trust their ears and pushed them out of their comfort zone. Their concern, however, was that it felt too random and they couldnât quite get to something they liked reliably. For that prototype, we used 50 manually cut samples from the BBC Introducing database manually graded on them two aspects: how danceable the track is and how much singing there is in it. The directions werenât labelled on purpose but it only made sense if you knew how it worked behind the scenes: it was hard to tell what each direction âmeantâ just by listening because the organisation of the tracks was not granular enough. For Orbit, we wanted to add more intentionality to the design: you should be able to go in a particular direction and feel it progressively get closer to your goal. More importantly, you should be able to feel it just from what youâre hearing. You can read more about the design work weâve done in our other article.   In short, we needed a better way to organise the music to give sense of direction to the navigation that was also scalable to thousands of tracks. Music is very often organised by genre â record shops have been organised this way for a long time. However, young people showed us that genres are less relevant to them today and artists seem to sit across genres more comfortably. Additionally, Spotify suggests that genres are now irrelevant to fans while organising their catalogue into over 6000 micro-genres. How many genres exist between well-known and well-understood genres like ârockâ and âfunkâ? How would you decide? Genres remain a useful shorthand to describe multiple aspects of a song. If someone says a track is ârock-yâ you can easily imagine that it has electric guitars (possibly distorted) and maybe sounds quite dark and aggressive. If someone says âfolk-yâ you can see acoustic guitars and a sparser arrangement, something softer and more relaxed. What if instead of breaking things down by genre, we could break down the genres themselves into component parts to start establishing a finer web of relationships between tracks? This way we could tell how close or far they are from each other sonically, exposing the complex overlap of genres. In his paper on musical similarity, Paul Arzelier shows how we can use mathematical distance between a series of musical descriptors to make more coherent playlists. The shorter the distance, the less difference there is between the tracks. Paul uses Bliss, his own open-source library, to extract several timbral and chromatic features from an audio file and combines them to calculate the distance. Though this was very promising, we had another hurdle to face: we didnât want to make linear playlists but a multi-dimensional exploration tool with a feeling of direction. We wanted users to move based on what they heard: they have to feel the music become more or less âaggressiveâ or âhappyâ in a way they understood so they could follow their ears. To get these more âhumanâ descriptors we used an open-source library called Essentia from the University of Barcelona. It provides machine learning models to extrapolate musical information from audio files (previously used in another project to analyse the Introducing database) such as danceability but also how aggressive, happy, sad or relaxed a track sounds. With so many descriptors to choose from, picking only two as weâd done in the first prototype seemed as reductive as mashing them all into a single indicator. To strike a balance and still distribute the tracks on a 2D plane, we used a dimensionality reduction technique popular in data visualisation: a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A PCA allows you to condense the most important information of a dataset by finding similarity between each data point based on their associated descriptors. In doing so, it compresses many of the descriptors into new âprincipal componentsâ which can be used as axes for a visual representation. As a result, each axis cannot be labelled easily as they now represent (âexplainâ) many features at once. We could pour all the descriptors we assembled from Essentia and Bliss into the PCA and obtain two axes to visualise our dataset. However, we needed a way to make sure that tracks were not just mathematically linked, but that their position made intuitive sense to a human going from track to track. Because the PCA looks for the strongest differences and decides how similar two tracks are based on this, the quality of these relationships entirely depends on the quality of the descriptors: do you have too many, the wrong ones or are they even accurate enough to group and separate tracks effectively? So to make Orbit, we first built a tool that could change which features were going into the PCA and showed us the resulting plot. It also allowed us to play the tracks by clicking on points in the plot, meaning we could experience the similarity between the tracks with our own ears. This method had a lot of potential but clearly we needed to fine-tune which descriptors went into the PCA to get a more successful organisation. To know whether our new organisation was successful, we re-introduced genres into the plot by colour-coding each point using data extracted with Essentia. Now we could see if tracks from a similar genre were still roughly grouped together â because genres still represent the âcompressedâ version of many descriptors â and we could see them appear as areas overlapping with each other, like a Venn diagram with interstitial pockets of micro-genres. We reduced our 30+ descriptors to just eight âhumanâ ones: aggressive, danceable, electronic, happy, instrumental, party, relaxed, sad. Each track being rated from -1 (not at all) to 1 (very) on each of those. We tried various combinations until we could see some separation between opposed genres (e.g. classical vs dance) but see similarity between others (e.g.funk and hip-hop) while confirming by listening. The final result makes sense to a computer but should also make sense to a human as they listen. With this list of adjectives, we can now describe tracks across genres and the PCA can position them into space. The PCA gives us x/y coordinates for each track and we can use the distance between these points to determine their musical similarity â much like in Paulâs paper, but in two dimensions and with different indicators. However, for every single track, we need to establish which tracks theyâre connected to. We used a Delaunay triangulation to find the closest neighbours for each point, regardless of distance. If a point is an outlier, the distance between two neighbouring tracks may be huge (and therefore their similarity low), but this is actually something we value to create doorways to new different genres. The resulting plot looked a lot like constellations in the night sky, so we dubbed the graph the âstar fieldâ. At this point, we have all the data necessary to build a system that starts with a track and allows you to intuitively navigate based on the features weâve chosen, at scale. The result is not perfect, but itâs all we needed to run our pilot with reasonable confidence. The last challenge is to automatically cut representative samples of the tracks that let users make quick decisions. Our first prototype used manually edited short snippets â less than 30 seconds that we thought were representative â to let users quickly decide about what theyâre hearing. In our testing, users only needed a few seconds to choose between listening further or skipping. However, we need to do the artists justice with their work and choosing the âwrongâ sample would be unfair to them. Ideally, the artists themselves would select the most representative part of their track, however this wasnât practical for the pilot as weâre re-using an existing infrastructure. The process of finding and cutting that snippet is a well-known problem called audio thumbnailing. The common solution is to find which part of the song is the chorus and use that, as itâs usually the most engaging part of the song. Traditionally weâd do this by finding the most âenergeticâ part of the track â and the BBC even has an open-source library to do this. However, this method did not prove very accurate and didnât scale well across genres in our testing. Fortunately, recent advances in machine learning have made song structure analysis easier and we can now more reliably detect the chorus. We used an open-source library called all-in-one to do this with excellent results. For songs that donât have a chorus or where a chorus cannot be found (some electronic or folk music, for example), we trim any silence from the start and cut the first 20 seconds of the track. Consequently, we created an automated process using machine learning to cut and organise the tracks in an intuitive way. It facilitates organic discovery by reinforcing a sense of direction during exploration. Itâs notable that weâre doing this directly by looking at the track audio and no other external metadata. It doesnât matter who listened to it or how much â itâs organised in relation to the other tracks in the dataset and how they sound. By breaking down genres into a set of observable adjectives and rebuilding them on a 2D plane, weâve created a more flexible and organic layout. Because ease of exploration was our priority, we found a different way to organise and discover music. Orbit puts the users back in the driving seat, getting them to make conscious decisions about what they want to listen to rather than just taking what an algorithm feeds them. In doing so, it restores the feeling of ownership over musical discoveries and makes finding new tracks as fun and exciting as flipping through records in a bargain bin. In the first 3 months of the trial, we had over 1 000 000 samples requested and itâs a very promising start. Weâre now sharing the findings with our colleagues to see how best to take Orbit and its findings forward. Part two of this series covers the design of the experience which gives users control of the music discovery process. The page will automatically reload.

        "title": "King’s Vatican visit postponed due to Pope illness",
        "content": "King Charles will still visit Italy next month The King and Queen have postponed their state visit to the Vatican, after doctors said the Pope needed to rest following a recent illness. The visit to the Vatican was postponed by \"mutual agreement\", according to a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The wider state visit to Italy will continue in April with some alterations to the planned programme. \"Their Majesties send The Pope their best wishes for his convalescence and look forward to visiting him in The Holy See, once he has recovered,\" the palace said. The royal trip had been billed as a \"historic visit\" during the year of the Papal Jubilee. It would have marked the building of symbolic links between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, of which King Charles is the Supreme Governor. Pope Francis, 88, was only recently discharged from hospital in Rome after being admitted with breathing difficulties in February. The Pope was diagnosed with pneumonia in both of his lungs shortly after his admission to hospital.  Later that month, the Vatican warned the pontiff was in a \"critical\" condition after developing both respiratory and kidney problems. He is susceptible to infections after having part of a lung removed as a young man. Catholics have been united in their prayers for the Pope's health in recent weeks. His condition improved following treatment at Rome's Gemelli Hospital. The Pope made his first public appearance since his admission to hospital on the weekend. The wider trip to Italy has been planned to support relationships between the UK and Italy, reflecting \"values, history and culture\" shared by the two countries. The king is expected to meet Italy's president and prime minister and become the first UK monarch to address both houses of the Italian parliament. The royals have also been invited to be guests at a state banquet. There will be disappointment that the Vatican elements of the visit will no longer take place. The trip was planned this year as it is Jubilee Year for all Catholics â something that only happens once very 25 years. An audience with the Pope and a service in the Sistine Chapel were key elements of the visit to the Vatican planned for the start of next month. Just last week, Buckingham Palace said that the King and Queen shared their \"hopes and prayers\" that the health of Pope Francis would enable the trip to go ahead.  Royal sources said the \"outlook was positive\" although also warned that the programme would be reviewed on the advice of the Pope's medical team. This is the first state visit for the king and queen this year. They will also celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary while in Italy.

Officers were called at 12:46 GMT on Tuesday to Powis Gardens in Notting Hill following a report that the body of a baby had been found in a bag left outside All Saints Church. London Ambulance Service attended and the baby was declared dead at the scene. The Met said \"urgent enquiries\" were ongoing to locate the baby's mother. At this stage the baby's gender or exact age has not been established, the force added. A blue police tent is up at the scene Supt Owen Renowden said it was \"an extremely sad and shocking matter\" and officers were trying to establish what has taken place. He said the force's \"immediate priority\" was to locate the baby's mother, as officers believe she may have very recently given birth. \"If you are the baby's mother and are reading this, please come forward to police or medical professionals. \"You must feel very frightened but please let us help â we are really worried about you and it is vitally important you get medical assistance and support.\" Anyone with information was urged to call the Met on 101, giving reference CAD 3431/25March.

        "title": "Joey Barton guilty of assault for kicking wife in head",
        "content": "Barton has been found guilty of a single charge of assault by beating Former footballer Joey Barton has been found guilty of assault by beating after pushing his wife to the floor and kicking her in the head. The midfielder, 42, who played for Manchester City and QPR, assaulted Georgia Barton, 38, in June 2021 during a drunken row at their family home in Kew, south-west London. The pair, who had been drinking with two other couples while their children slept upstairs started arguing after Barton threatened to fight his wife's brother and father, Westminster Magistrates' Court previously heard. Barton, who was the manager of Bristol Rovers at the time, was given a 12-week suspended prison sentence. Mrs Barton was left with a lump on her forehead and a bleeding nose, the court previously heard. She had called police immediately after the attack, saying her husband had \"just hit\" her, but later sent a letter to the prosecution retracting her allegations. Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring rejected Barton's account of events and described them as \"vague\" as he convicted him. While he acknowledged Barton had \"a record of violence\", the magistrate said: \"I am satisfied that it is not necessary to impose an immediate custodial sentence.\" Mr Goldspring said a mitigating factor was that the couple remained in a \"happy relationship\" with a young child, adding: \"That is not something I want to interfere with.\" Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Barton said he was \"really disappointed\" with the magistrates' verdict and intended to appeal to decision at the High Court. Prosecution barrister Helena Duong told the court Mrs Barton's 999 call to police on the night of the assault was \"compelling evidence\", as she had described it in \"clear terms\". Ms Duong said Mrs Barton's bloody nose was \"an injury that really requires an explanation\", adding: \"It was, plainly, something not caused by an accident.\" Barton previously told the court he admitted getting into an argument with his wife, but denied that anything \"physical\" had happened. He was arrested in his bedroom on the night of the incident, where he had been asleep and was still drunk, the trial was told. Georgia and Joey Barton previously attended Westminster Magistrates' Court in January ahead of proceedings The former footballer was due to face trial at a magistrates' court in 2022 but the case was adjourned after Mrs Barton sent a letter retracting her allegations. In the letter, she said her injuries had been caused by accident when a friend moved in to separate the pair. A judge ordered that proceedings be paused over concerns a trial would be unfair to Barton after the prosecution said they did not plan to ask Mrs Barton to give evidence in court. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Stephen Parkinson, appealed against the decision at the High Court in London, with barristers claiming at a hearing that a fair trial could go ahead. In a judgment in June, two senior judges ruled in the DPP's favour and said Barton should face a trial over the allegations in front of a different judge. Barton was also ordered to pay Â£2,183 in victim surcharge and prosecution costs within seven days.

        "title": "Emile Soleil: Twist as grandparents arrested on suspicion of toddler's murder in French Alps",
        "content": "Four people, including the grandparents of Emile Soleil, have been arrested over the two-year-old's disappearance and death in the French Alps in July 2023. The two other people arrested on suspicion of voluntary homicide and concealment of a corpse are adult children of Emile's grandparents, prosecutors said in a statement. The grandparents' lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, told AFP on Tuesday morning that she had no comment, having \"only just heard\" about the development. Last year, some of the toddler's bones and clothes were found by a hiker near the home of Emile's maternal grandparents in the French Alps, where the boy had gone missing the previous summer. But prosecutors at the time said that the remains offered no further clues as to the cause of Emile's death, adding that it could have been as a result of \"a fall, manslaughter or murder\". Tuesday's sudden twist, in a case that seemed to have gone cold, made headlines in France, where the search for Emile has been extensively covered by the media. When the toddler disappeared, dozens of journalists flocked to Haut-Vernet, often outnumbering the 25 residents of the tiny Alpine hamlet. The last sighting of Emile had been on 8 July 2023, when two neighbours saw him walking by himself on the only street in the village. Police were alerted by his grandmother shortly afterwards. Hundreds of people joined police, sniffer dogs and the military in a search the following day. Initially, French reports focused on Emile's grandfather - but his lawyer said that she hoped investigators would not \"waste too much time on him to the detriment of other lines of inquiry\". Emile's remains were found days after police summoned 17 people - including members of Emile's family, neighbours and witnesses - to reconstruct the final moments before the boy disappeared. The toddler's funeral took place in February this year. Soon after, his maternal grandparents said that \"silence had made space for truth\" and that they could no longer \"live without answers\". \"We have had 19 months without a single certainty. We need to understand, we need to know,\" they said. In a statement, Aix-en-Provence chief prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon said that Tuesday's arrests were the result of investigations carried out over recent months, and that police were examining \"several spots in the area\". French media reported on Tuesday that the grandparents' home in the Provence region was being searched and that police had seized one of their vehicles. In France, people can be placed under arrest for questioning while police investigate whether they may have been involved in a crime. It does not mean legal proceedings will necessarily be started against them.

        "title": "Why is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishap The leak of classified information by President Donald Trump's national security team on an unsecured chat app may have broken three basic rules, according to analysts. Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he was accidentally included in the 18-member Signal group and saw details of imminent American strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen. The White House has acknowledged the messages reported by the Atlantic appear to be authentic.  Here are three basic issues with using Signal to share high-level information, experts told the BBC. Signal has gone from a platform favoured by dissidents to the unofficial whisper network of Washington officialdom. Privacy and tech experts say the popular end-to-end encrypted platform is more secure than conventional texting. The app is open-source, meaning its code is available for independent experts to scour for vulnerabilities. But like any messaging app with high-value targets, state-backed hackers try to find a way into Signal chats. Google Threat Intelligence Group has noticed increasing efforts to compromise the platform by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services. The app is not banned outright by the US government. Under President Joe Biden, some officials were allowed to download Signal on their White House-issued phones. But they were instructed to use the app sparingly and never to share classified information on it, former national security officials who served in the Democratic administration told US media. Pentagon regulations state that messaging apps \"are NOT authorized to access, transmit, process non-public DoD information\", reports CNN. Signal is used for communications by militaries around the world, the app's president Meredith Whittaker told BBC News in December. But a cybersecurity expert tells the BBC that using Signal to communicate sensitive communications of this nature is risky. \"The channels that are generally used for communications within government systems are monitored and well-secured from a usage standpoint,\" said John Wheeler of Wheelhouse Advisors, a cybersecurity consultancy. With outside tools, he said, it appears there may be no authorisation protocols in place. \"Something of this sensitive nature should really require some very strict protocols in terms of communications,\" Wheelhouse told the BBC. \"I was very surprised that they would be using this sort of solution.\" He added that this incident might make US partners abroad think twice before communicating sensitive information to American officials. Trump's national security team's chat app leak stuns Washington Top US officials shared Yemen strike plans with journalist in group chat Who are the Houthis and why are they attacking Red Sea ships? Using a Signal chat to share highly classified information and accidentally including a reporter on the discussion could raise the possibility of violations of federal laws such as the Espionage Act. It can be a crime to mishandle, misuse or abuse classified information, though it is unclear whether such provisions might have been breached in this case. Mara Karlin, who served under six secretaries of state and was assistant secretary of defence, told the BBC the leak is \"stunning\" and \"not normal\". Karlin said these types of conversations should take place in a secure space, in the Pentagon or in the Situation Room in the White House, not in a Signal group chat. Sensitive government communications are required to take place in a sealed-off room called a Sensitive Compartmentalised Information Facility (Scif), where mobile phones are generally forbidden. The US government has other systems in place to communicate classified information, including the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) and the Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) network, which top government officials can access via specifically configured laptops and phones. Karlin says she expects both allies and adversaries to pay attention to this, saying they will ask: \"Can the US government keep sensitive information in a secure manner?\" Inspector general investigations and congressional investigations will be carried out, Karlin predicts. \"This is historic,\" she adds. Samar Ali, a professor of politics and law at Vanderbilt University who worked on counter-terrorism with the homeland security department in the Obama administration, said of the leak: \"It's baffling. It's shocking. It's dangerous.\" The text chain shows \"a clear violation of our national security laws\", she told the BBC. Prof Ali wonders what accountability the Trump team might face, and notes that she would have lost her job and security clearance if she committed any of these violations. The White House has denied any classified information was shared on the chat. This video can not be played Watch: Former defence adviser Mara Karlin says group chat mishap 'not normal' Some of the Signal messages National Security Adviser Michael Waltz sent to the chat were set to disappear after one week, Jeffrey Goldberg reported in his article for the Atlantic. If confirmed, that would raise questions about two federal laws that require the preservation of government records: the Presidential Records Act and the Federal Records Act. \"The law requires that electronic messages that take place on a non-official account are preserved, in some fashion, on an official electronic record keeping system,\" said Jason R Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration. Such regulations would cover Signal, he said. Official government communications are supposed to be either automatically archived, or the individuals involved are supposed to forward, copy or preserve the messages. \"The open question here is whether these communications were automatically archived,\" Baron told the BBC. \"It's not clear whether that occurred.\" It was also unclear whether the individuals in the chat had taken other steps to preserve the records. \"We should all be concerned about the use of these electronic messaging apps to evade federal record keeping requirements,\" Baron said.

        "title": "Paddington Bear statue: RAF engineers admit damage",
        "content": "This video can not be played CCTV captured the moment the two men damaged a Paddington Bear statue Two RAF engineers who broke a Paddington statue have been told by a judge they are the \"antithesis\" of everything the bear stands for. Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22 and based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, each admitted an offence of criminal damage at Reading Magistrates' Court. The statue in Newbury, Berkshire, was damaged before being taken shortly after 02:00 GMT on 2 March. The pair, who committed the offence while drunk on a night out, have been ordered to carry out unpaid work and each pay Â£2,725 to cover the cost of repairs. William Lawrence (left) and Daniel Heath took the statue in a taxi back to RAF Odiham, the court heard On sentencing, district judge Sam Goozee said Paddington Bear was a \"beloved cultural icon\". \"He represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society,\" he said. \"His famous label attached to his duffle coat says 'please look after this bear'. \"On the night of the 2nd of March 2025, your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for. \"Your actions lacked respect and integrity, two values you should uphold as members of the armed forces.\" The newly installed statue was stolen from a bench on 2 March CCTV footage was shown in court in which Heath, of Oakhall Park, Thornton, near Bradford in West Yorkshire, and Lawrence, of John Street, Enderby, Leicestershire, could be seen stopping by the Paddington Bear statue on Northbrook Street and attempting to lift it off the bench. The seam of the statue then broke off and the pair could be seen walking off with the broken half. The judge said the men then took it in a taxi back to RAF Odiham. Thames Valley Police confirmed the statue did appear for sale on Facebook marketplace, but did not investigate further as it was recovered from the boot of Lawrence's car soon after. The statue was recovered by police Mr Goozee, who handed each of them a 12-month community order, said the pair had committed \"an act of wanton vandalism\". The defendants' defence lawyer, Tom Brymer, told the court they were \"extremely ashamed about their actions\". \"They are two men who are very different than what we see on the CCTV footage,\" he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Air Force said they were aware of the trial outcome, but any disciplinary action would be a private matter. The statue was unveiled in Newbury - the home of Paddington's creator Michael Bond - in October 2024. Mr Goozee said this made the statue in the Berkshire town even more significant. It was one of 23 placed across the UK as part of the Paddington Visits Trail. In a statement read out by prosecutor Jaimie Renuka, CEO of Newbury Business Improvement District (BID) Trish Willetts said the remains of the statue had to be covered with a bin bag to prevent it from upsetting children. The damaged statue was recovered but a date for its return has yet to be confirmed.

        "title": "Lower Thames Crossing plan for Essex and Kent is approved",
        "content": "The tunnels will be located to the east of Gravesend in Kent, and to the west of East Tilbury in Essex The largest road tunnel in the UK will be built after a Â£9bn plan was approved by the government. The Lower Thames Crossing would link Tilbury, Essex, and Gravesend in Kent by two tunnels running underneath the River Thames. National Highways hoped the road would reduce traffic at the Dartford Crossing by 20% and open by 2032. Jim Dickson, the Labour MP for Dartford, said the decision would \"finally deliver a solution to the traffic chaos\" faced by motorists. The 14.5-mile (23km) road would link the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock. About 2.6 miles (4.2km) of the route would be underground, with a northbound and a southbound tunnel running next to each other beneath the Thames. Tuesday's announcement was 16 years in the making, with the project first mooted in 2009 and more than Â£1.2bn in taxpayers' money spent on planning since. The application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate for consideration by National Highways on 31 October 2022.  A recommendation for its approval was subsequently made to Secretary of State for Transport Heidi Alexander on 20 March. National Highways has planned to begin construction in 2026. Dickson said: \"For far too long governments have dodged making a decision on the Lower Thames Crossing, leaving Dartford residents to endure endless gridlock. \"This decision will unlock economic growth across the country and finally deliver a solution to the traffic chaos faced by my constituents on a daily basis.\" The government has said it will work with the private sector to fund the project The BBC understands the decision on the funding model has not been made yet, but the utility works would be publicly funded, alongside significant private sector finance. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said in January that the private sector could help \"to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs\". Reacting to the announcement on X, external, James McMurdock, the South Basildon and East Thurrock MP, said congestion in Kent would remain \"unresolved\" despite the project. The Reform UK MP feared miles of countryside would be \"covered with tarmac\" adding: \"Where has our pride and ambition gone?\" Campaigners have also raised concerns about ancient woodland being impacted by the works. Chris Todd, the director of Transport Action Network, said the decision was \"absolute madness\". He added: \"The only way that the government can afford this white elephant would be to take money from all the other nations and regions in the UK.  \"Rather than boosting growth, this will clog up roads in the south east and slow the economy down even more.\" Gareth Bacon, the Conservative shadow secretary of state for transport, welcomed the project's approval. \"The devil will be in the detail, not least on how this project is to be funded,\" he said. The Lib Dem MP for Tunbridge Wells, Mike Martin, added: \"The announcement today must not come at the expense of other vital transport infrastructure in the area - including for rail connections between Kent and Essex.\" National Highways has described the project as \"the most significant road project in a generation\". Executive director Matt Palmer added: \"It will unlock growth with quicker, safer, and more reliable journeys. \"Our plans have been shaped by the local community and refined by robust and rigorous examination from independent experts.\" This video can not be played Listen: Lower Thames Crossing plans are approved Private sector could finance crossing - chancellor Businesses call for Lower Thames Crossing approval 'Lower Thames crossing will ruin our village' Lower Thames Crossing Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Rwanda planning to attack Burundi, President Évariste Ndayishimiye tells BBC",
        "content": "This video can not be played President Ãvariste Ndayishimiye: Burundians will not accept to be killed as Congolese are being killed Burundi's president has told the BBC he has seen \"credible intelligence\" that Rwanda plans to attack his country. Ãvariste Ndayishimiye also said that Rwanda had tried to launch a coup a decade ago in Burundi, akin to \"what it's doing in the Democratic Republic of Congo\" now. Rwanda has already hit back, calling the president's comments \"surprising\" and insisting that the two neighbours are co-operating on security plans for their shared border, which has been shut for over a year. Despite extensive UN evidence, Rwanda has always denied arming and backing the M23 rebel group, which has recently seized large parts of eastern DR Congo alongside Rwandan troops.  Rwanda has also denied links to the resurgent Red Tabara rebel group, which President Ndayishimiye says is a proxy force similar to the M23 and is being supported by Rwanda to destabilise Burundi. \"They would say it's an internal problem when it's Rwanda [who is] the problem. We know that he [Rwanda's President Paul Kagame] has a plan to attack Burundi,\" Ndayishimiye added.  \"Burundians will not accept to be killed as Congolese are being killed. Burundian people are fighters. \"But now we don't have any plans to attack Rwanda. We want to resolve that problem by dialogue.\" At the heart of Ndayishimiye's comments was a call for peace and the full implementation of an agreement between the two nations - a peace deal that had been signed in previous years but, according to Burundi, had not been honoured by Rwanda. \"The people who did the 2015 coup [were] organised by Rwanda, and then they ran away. Rwanda organised them - it went to recruit the youth in Mahama camp. It trained them, it gave them arms, it financed them. They are living in the hand of Rwanda,\" he alleges. \"If Rwanda accepts to hand over them and bring them to justice, the problem would be finished.\" Who's pulling the strings in the DR Congo crisis? Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? Ndayishimiye added: \"We are calling on our neighbours to respect the peace agreements we have made. \"There is no need for us to go to war. We want dialogue, but we will not sit idle if we are attacked. \"We don't have anything to ask [of] Rwanda [in return], but they refuse because they have a bad plan - they wanted to do what they're doing in the DRC.\" The Rwanda-Burundi border remains closed long after Red Tabara rebels carried out several attacks on Burundian soil. While the situation with Rwanda is critical, it is not Burundi's only problem. To the west, the ongoing conflict in mineral-rich DR Congo has reached a boiling point with rebel groups, militias, and foreign parties vying to control the country's valuable resources. \"External forces are responsible for perpetuating this conflict. They do not want peace in the DRC because they want to continue looting its resources,\" Ndayishimiye told the BBC. \"The crisis in the DRC is not about the people - it is about the minerals.\" The solution, he argues, is to bring all parties to the table, including \"all opposition political parties and armed groups\", who must \"sit together and see together how they can create the best future for all citizens\". But in his view it all depends on whether Rwanda will show willing. \"The problem between Rwanda and the DRC is a small problem, they can resolve it without killing people. For example, I hear that Rwanda says it is going there [to DRC] because of the FDLR [a Rwandan rebel group accused of links to the 1994 genocide].  \"But who [is being] killed? All I see is Congolese - why do they kill Congolese when they say they are looking for FDLR?\" Since M23 rebels and Rwandan troops began seizing cities in eastern DR Congo in January, war has forced many hundreds of thousands of Congolese people to flee the violence and their homes. So desperate are they to find safety that some have even crossed the Rusizi river in makeshift vessels or swum to reach Burundi, despite the dangerous journey killing many people including a three-year-old child. This video can not be played Congolese refugees are risking their lives crossing the Rusizi river into Burundi Living precariously in refugee camps, some say they want to go back to their country but complain that the Burundi-DR Congo border is closed. This is something Burundi's president denies. \"No, our border with the Congo is not closed. Where did they pass to come into Burundi? Even today they can use [the Rusizi river] to go back.\" When told by the BBC that crossing the Rusizi rivers puts refugees in a position of danger, Ndayishimiye replied: \"You know, we didn't invite them. \"They can go back, we will not refuse them to go back. But when they are here, they are as our visitors. If a visitor comes your house - it's you who chooses the room where he will stay.  \"Even the food they have is what we share. They can't say I will eat meat when you are eating fish.\" For the war to end and the Congolese to achieve lasting peace, Ndayishimiye says  â the mandate of international forces in DR Congo should be expanded so that they can engage the rebels.  He has also stated that â Burundi forces will not be withdrawn from DR Congo until Burundi is assured that its borders are safe. Earlier this month, southern Africa leaders announced that their forces would be withdrawn from DR Congo where they were helping fight the M23, after at least 19 were killed.

        "content": "Rescue operations are under way at the 20m-wide sinkhole in Seoul A man who fell into a large sinkhole in South Korea's capital Seoul has been found dead, according to the local fire department. The man was riding his motorbike in the Gangdong district when the road caved in at about 18:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Monday. Rescuers found his body underground on Tuesday morning around 11:00 local time, about 50m (164ft) from where he had fallen in. A car driver was also injured in the incident, which has gone viral on South Korean social media. A widely circulated video appears to show the moment the road caved in A dashcam video widely circulating online appears to show the moment the road caved in near a traffic junction. It shows the motorcyclist falling into the hole, while a car travelling in front of him narrowly escapes it. Earlier on Tuesday, rescuers found a mobile phone and the motorcycle in the hole which is 20m wide and 20m deep, according to local media. The man, said to be in his 30s, has yet to be named by authorities. Kim Chang-seop, head of Gangdong fire station said at an earlier briefing that there were 2,000 tons of soil and water mixed inside the hole. Authorities have yet to reveal the cause of the sinkhole. A report recently submitted to the Seoul city government showed that 223 sinkholes occurred in the city in the past decade. These were caused by poor infrastructure management, ageing or damaged pipes, long-term subsidence and accidents caused by excavation work. In January, a truck driver went missing after his vehicle fell into a sinkhole at a junction in the Japanese city of Yashio. Last August, a search for a woman who disappeared into a pavement sinkhole in Kuala Lumpur's city centre was called off after a week. One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time. In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface. The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - this is called a collapse sinkhole. But human activities such as excavation works can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way. Additional reporting by Rachel Lee of BBC Korean.

        "title": "Pizza Hut workers accuse franchisee of docking wages",
        "content": "Delivery driver Cian says it is his duty to speak out although he fears losing his job Pizza Hut workers are accusing a franchise of ''blatantly unlawful'' behaviour alleging it has altered timesheets, docked wages and stopped payments per delivery. Glenshire Group which runs all 22 Pizza Hut delivery outlets in Scotland has been served with a grievance by the Unite union on behalf of drivers who claim they were told of changes by text with no consultation. Delivery driver, Cian, told the BBC that Glenshire had shown ''a complete disdain for their staff and their customers'' and said it was ''quite honestly abysmal''. Glenshire said it is \"absolutely committed to robust employment practices\" and said it is \"listening to our colleagues, to understand where there are concerns\". Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of Â£1.45 per delivery. But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.  He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to Â£12.21 an hour but he had lost his Â£1.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\". ''The Â£1.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC. \"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.'' In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\" The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire. In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\". Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April. Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from Â£11.44 to Â£12.21. \"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said. He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage. \"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.'' Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.  In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\" Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages. In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\". A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks. \"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.'' Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.'' Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit. In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\". It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.  The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\". Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations. \"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says. Adam called on bosses of the Pizza Hut company to investigate the Glenshire franchise. \"Please be aware of what this company are doing to your brand. Please be aware of what they're doing to the staff and all for their own benefit, all to save them money,\" he said. A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"Pizza Hut is deeply committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all employees and as such has strict policies in place that its franchise businesses must adhere to. \"Although Glenshire Group operates as an independent franchisee and is ultimately responsible for its own employment practices, we take these allegations seriously.  \"Glenshire will be actively engaging in the coming days with any concerned employees, and we will continue to investigate this situation.\" How have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

        "title": "Priority pathogens: UK draws up new disease-threat watch list",
        "content": "Oropouche virus, spread by biting midges and some mosquitoes, is on the list The UK has a new watch list of 24 infectious diseases that could pose the greatest future threat to public health.  Some are viruses with global pandemic potential - like Covid - while others are illnesses that have no existing treatments or could cause significant harm.  Avian, or bird, flu is on the list, as well as mosquito-spread illnesses that may become common with rising temperatures from climate change, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), external.  The aim is to steer scientists and investors into making new tests and vaccines or medicines in preparation.  There is no ranking within the list, since threats constantly change, UKHSA chief scientific officer Prof Isabel Oliver says.  And it will be updated at least once a year, to avoid a repeat of the Covid pandemic, where experts had been planning for an entirely different outbreak - influenza.  \"When Covid arrived, it took too long to adjust our response to a different threat, which was part of the reason we ended up in lockdown,\" Prof Mark Woolhouse, director of the Tackling Infections to Benefit Africa, University of Edinburgh, said. \"Since the pandemic, there have been many initiatives to better understand the diversity of pandemic threats that the UK and the world may face in the coming years.   \"The UKHSA's pathogen prioritisation exercise is a welcome contribution to this global effort.\" A family of viruses called Paramyxoviridae, which includes measles, is on the list. And this was the type of pandemic threat public-health agencies around the world were most worried about, Prof Woolhouse said. A novel measles-like virus would be highly spreadable and \"impossible to control by even the strictest lockdown\", making it \"a threat far worse than Covid.\"   \"It would also be considerably more deadly and, unlike Covid, it would be a [major] threat to children,\" Prof Woolhouse said. Prof Oliver said the UKHSA would consult animal-health colleagues for future updates, since many new and emerging outbreaks were zoonotic disease that jumped species to infect humans.  Some bacteria also feature, including those such as gonorrohoea where resistance to existing antibiotic treatments is becoming an issue. Adenovirus Lassa fever Norovirus Mers Ebola (and similar viruses, such as Marburg) Flaviviridae (which includes dengue, Zika and hepatitis C) Hantavirus Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever Flu (non-seasonal, including avian) Nipah virus Oropouche Rift Valley fever Acute flaccid myelitis Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) Mpox Chikungunya Anthrax Q fever Enterobacteriaceae (such as E. coli and Yersinia pestis, which causes plague) Tularaemia Moraxellaceae (which cause lung, urine and bloodstream infections) Gonorrhoea Staphlylococcus Group A and B Strep Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "content": "Hamdan Ballal poses with Rachel Szor after they won Best Documentary Feature Film for No Other Land at the Oscars A Palestinian Oscar winner who activists say was attacked by Israeli settlers before being detained by the Israeli military has been released, his co-director has said. Hamdan Ballal, who co-directed No Other Land, had his house in the Israeli-occupied West Bank surrounded by settlers during an attack on Monday, the activists said. His co-director Yuval Abraham - who said Mr Ballal was beaten by settlers then taken by soldiers while in an ambulance, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied -  said on Tuesday afternoon that Mr Ballal had been freed.  The IDF said three Palestinians and an Israeli had been detained on suspicion of \"rock hurling\" at security forces. The five activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence group (CJNV) said they had gone to the village to document the incident and had come under attack themselves, with settlers smashing their car windows, and punching and hitting them with sticks. Earlier, an activist who was at the scene told the BBC the three detained Palestinians, including Mr Ballal, were injured in the settler attack and had been held at an Israeli police station in the West Bank.  They are suspected of throwing stones and injuring a young settler shepherd and were interrogated, the activist said, adding that they had access to a lawyer.  The attack began at about 18:00 (16:00 GMT) on Monday, when around a dozen masked settlers mounted an attack in the village of Susya, according to the activists. Mr Ballal's house is reported to have been surrounded by the settlers. Yuval Abraham, the Israeli director who won the Oscar this month alongside Mr Ballal, said people had been injured and properties destroyed in the attack. This video can not be played The activists released this video which they said showed settlers attacking them The activist who spoke to the BBC said they had complained to the Israeli soldiers that they were under attack.  They said the army initially watched the attack, then approached only as the assault on the car was ending.  The soldiers then refused to pursue the settlers, leaving them free to attack houses on the other side of the hill, the activist said. The IDF confirmed that soldiers and police had arrived to disperse the confrontation. They said rocks had been \"hurled\" at security forces. \"In response, the forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation,\" the IDF said. \"The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police. An Israeli citizen was injured in the incident and was evacuated to receive medical treatment.\" No Other Land - which picked up best documentary at the 97th Academy Awards - follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of about 20 villages, and the friendship between Adra and Abraham. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.  They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point for violence and conflicting claims over land. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank has surged.

The global online scamming industry is said to be worth some $500 billion a year. It operates in secret, in complexes hidden behind high fences in countries all over the world. It is a particular problem in the Philippines, where much of the industry is run by Chinese criminal organisations. The scammers, whose job it is to persuade their victims to part with their hard-earned money, are often themselves the victims of crime, people trafficked across borders by gangsters and held prisoner in these “scam hubs”, forced to work. It is a particular problem in the Philippines, where, in March 2024 the police raided a compound in a small town north of the capital, Manila. There they found several hundred people working. The spotlight immediately turned on the mayor of the town, Alice Guo, a colourful and energetic 32-year-old, who owned some of the land on which the compound was built. We investigate the allegations against the former mayor who has now been charged with people trafficking, money laundering and tax evasion. There is a further, more lurid, and unproven allegation that she is a spy for China.

        "title": "Trump's national security team's chat app leak stuns Washington",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: President Trump says he knows 'nothing' about journalist in Houthi strike group chat There are few US presidential actions more sensitive, more fraught with peril, than when and where to use American military force. If such information were obtained by American adversaries in advance, it could put lives â and national foreign policy objectives - at risk. Fortunately for the Trump administration, a group chat with information about an impending US strike in Yemen among senior national security officials on the encrypted chat app Signal did not fall into the wrong hands. Unfortunately for the Trump administration, the message thread was observed by an influential political journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg. LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after Signal chat where US officials discussed air strike plans shared with reporter The Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. Members of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others. A National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\". Goldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike â conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team. \"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March. He followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations. These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however. That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration. And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information. \"This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe,\" Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, posted on X. This video can not be played Watch: Goldberg says officials got 'luckyâ it was him inadvertently added to group chat Democratic congressman Chris Deluzio said in a press statement that the House Armed Services Committee, on which he sits, must conduct a full investigation and hearing on the matter as soon as possible. \"This is an outrageous national security breach, and heads should roll,\" he said. Criticism wasn't limited to Democrats, either. Don Bacon, a Republican congressman from Nebraska, told the political website Axios that the administration's action was \"unconscionable\". \"None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,\" he said of Waltz's messaging. \"Russia and China are surely monitoring his unclassified phone.\" With Republicans in control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump's own party would have to initiate any kind of formal congressional investigation into the matter. Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appeared to downplay such a possibility as he told reporters that the White House had admitted its error. \"They'll tighten up and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" he said. \"I don't know what else you can say about that.\" Trump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it. The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz.  By Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown. In its afternoon statement, the White House noted that the strikes were \"highly successful and effective\". That could help minimise some the political fallout from the chat-group discussions, which also revealed some divisions within Trump's national security team. This video can not be played Watch: Mike Johnson defends Trump administration after Yemen group chat mishap JD Vance was the highest-ranking participant in the Signal text group that discussed detailed plans about the US military strike on Yemen. While the vice-president has typically marched in lockstep with Trump in his public comments on foreign policy, in the private discussions he said that he thought the administration was making a \"mistake\" by taking military action. He noted that the targeted Houthi forces in Yemen posed a larger threat to European shipping, while the danger to American trade was minimal. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\" The vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\". \"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\" This is far from the first time a vice-president has disagreed with their president on matters of foreign policy. Dick Cheney clashed with George W Bush in the later years of his presidency over handling of the Iraq war, and Joe Biden believed that Barack Obama's covert operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was too risky. This video can not be played Watch: Senator Chuck Schumer demands 'full investigation' of Yemen strike group chat This is also not the first time that the handling of sensitive national security material has generated headlines. Both Trump and Joe Biden were investigated for their possession of classified information after leaving office. Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump for alleged violations related to his refusal to turn over material stored at his Mar-a-Lago residence â a case that was dropped when Trump won re-election last year. In 2016, Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for communications while US secretary of state became a major issue during her unsuccessful presidential campaign. Like this White House group chat, some of those messages provided insight into the inner workings of Clinton's team. Their revelation also proved to be politically damaging. A handful of her stored messages were later deemed to contain \"top secret\" information. \"We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential or classified,\" Trump said during that campaign â one of many attacks on Clinton for what he said was a clear violation of federal law. On Monday afternoon, Clinton took to social media to posted her own, brief comment on the revelations of the White House group chat on Signal. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" she wrote.

The Met Office said the shape was likely produced by a frozen plume of fuel from the rocket's exhaust, which reflected the sunlight and appeared to spin in the atmosphere. The cloud-like shape was visible for several minutes above the UK and elsewhere in Europe before fading. The Falcon 9 rocket from Elon Musk's space company lifted off at around 13:50 local time in Florida (17:50 GMT) on a classified US government mission. This image was taken in Bulwick, Northamptonshire The swirl was also spotted in Clee Hill, Shropshire  A night sky-watcher captured this picture in Gwynedd, Wales 1 of 3 The Falcon 9 is a reusable rocket.  After launching, the first part takes the payload it is carrying, such as a satellite into space. While this part of the rocket then turns back around towards Earth, the second stage of the rocket continues to take the satellite to the correct orbit.   Once released, the second stage will eject any leftover fuel, which freezes instantly due to the altitude and forms into a spiral pattern because of the rocket's movement as it falls back to Earth. Light is then reflected off the frozen fuel, making it visible on Earth. This video can not be played Watch: What caused the unusual display in the sky above the UK? Astronomer Allan Trow said it had appeared above Wales's Bannau Brycheiniog national park at around 20:00 GMT. He said he had seen the phenomenon before around four years ago.  \"But these are pretty rare,\" he told the BBC, and agreed the rocket was its likely source. Stockport-based Sonia was already out with her telescope when she saw \"a swirling galaxy that was moving across the sky\".   People living almost 200 miles (321km) away also spotted the unusual glow.   Steven Hall was taking his bins out from his home in rural Suffolk when he saw what looked like \"a huge Catherine wheel which appeared to have its own atmosphere around it\".

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: 'Nobody was texting war plans', says Pete Hegseth in response to The Atlantic report The Trump administration is facing political uproar after the White House confirmed that a journalist had been inadvertently added to an unsecure group chat in which US national security officials planned a military strike in Yemen. The Atlantic magazine's Jeffrey Goldberg reported, external that he had been added to a Signal message group which apparently included Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said he had seen classified military plans for US strikes on Houthi rebels, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck.  The report sparked a firestorm of criticism from opposition Democrats and concerns among several Republicans. This video can not be played Watch: President Trump says he knows 'nothing' about journalist in Houthi strike group chat Goldberg said he had been added to the message chain, apparently by accident, after receiving a connection request from someone who appeared to be White House National Security Advisor Michael Waltz.  \"If they were going to pick an errant phone number, I mean at least it wasn't somebody who supported the Houthis, because they were actually handing out information that I believe could have endangered the lives of American service people who were involved in that operation,\" he told PBS in an interview.  President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday afternoon that he was not aware of the Atlantic article. \"The attacks on the Houthis have been highly successful and effective,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.  \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"  The defence secretary also defended the military operation discussed in the chat, citing its success. When pressed by reporters, Hegseth criticised Goldberg as a \"deceitful and highly discredited\" journalist and resisted questions about the content of the messages.  House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said the breach had been a mistake, but argued that the chat showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well\". Democratic lawmakers demanded an investigation, casting the episode as a national security scandal. \"This is one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence that I have read about in a very, very long time,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said. Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said his panel planned to investigate the matter. \"It's definitely a concern,\" he added. \"It appears that mistakes were made.\" This video can not be played Watch: Senator Chuck Schumer demands 'full investigation' of Yemen strike group chat Atlantic editor-in-chief Goldberg writes in his article that he received a connection request on 11 March on the encrypted messaging app Signal from an account that purported to be Waltz's. Goldberg said he was then added to a chat entitled \"Houthi PC small group\". He had initially wondered if the messages in the chat might be a hoax until four days later, Saturday 15 March, when he was sitting in a supermarket car park, watching Signal communications about a strike. When he checked X for updates about Yemen, he wrote, he was stunned to see reports of explosions in the capital city of Sanaa. A Houthi official posted on X at the time that 53 people had been killed in the US air strikes. Signal is generally used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and to send disappearing messages. A number of accounts that appeared to belong to cabinet members and national security officials were included in the 18-person chat, Goldberg reported. Accounts labelled \"JD Vance\", the name of the vice-president; \"Pete Hegseth,\" the defence secretary; and \"John Ratcliffe,\" director of the Central Intelligence Agency; were among names in the chain.  Top national security officials from various agencies also appeared in it, including Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Live updates: Yemen strike plans shared with journalist Trump's national security team's chat app leak stuns Washington At one point during the communications over the strikes, the account labelled \"JD Vance\" seemed to disagree with Trump, Goldberg reported. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" the Vance account wrote at approximately 8:15 on 14 March. \"There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices.  \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself.  \"But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\" In a statement to the BBC on Monday, Vance spokesman William Martin said the vice-president \"unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy\".  \"The president and the vice-president have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement,\" Martin said. The National Security Council confirmed much of the Atlantic report. Spokesman Brian Hughes told the BBC: \"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic. We are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy co-ordination between senior officials.\" This video can not be played Watch: Goldberg says officials got 'luckyâ it was him inadvertently added to group chat Goldberg reported that the officials had also discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes. \"Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,\" the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March. The message continued, saying that at Trump's request, his team was working with the defence department and state department \"to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans\". At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"  The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading.

        "title": "US cuts to HIV aid will cost millions of lives - UNAids chief",
        "content": "US funding cuts will lead to an additional 2,000 new HIV infections each day and over six million further deaths over the next four years, the UNAids chief has warned. It would mark a stark reversal in the global fight against HIV, which has seen the number of deaths from the disease decrease from more than two million in 2004 to 600,000 in 2023, the most recent year for which figures are available. UNAids Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said the US government's decision to pause foreign aid - which included funding for HIV programmes - was already having devastating consequences. She called on the US to reverse the cuts immediately, warning women and girls were being hit particularly hard. US President Donald Trump announced the pause on foreign aid, for an initial 90 days, on his first day in office in January as part of a review into government spending. The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes have since been terminated. Many US-financed HIV treatment and prevention programmes received stop work orders, leading to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Africa, and severe shortages of life saving anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines. Ms Byanyima said she feared a return to the 1990s, when HIV medication was scarcely available in poorer countries, and infections and deaths soared. The US has for years been the single biggest funder of HIV treatment and prevention, and Ms Byanima thanked Washington for its generosity and humanity. She added it was \"reasonable\" for the US \"to want to reduce its funding - over time\", but said the \"sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support [was] having a devastating impact\". There has been no sign that Washington is listening to appeals to change course. Traditional aid donors in Europe also plan funding cuts, and UNAids - the joint UN agency which combats HIV - has had no indication that other countries might step in to fill the gap left by the US. What is USAID and why is Trump poised to 'close it down'? Speaking in Geneva on Monday, Ms Byanyima described the case of Juliana, a young woman in Kenya living with HIV. She worked for a US-funded programme that supported new mothers to access treatment to ensure their babies did not develop the disease. With the programme suspended, Ms Byanyima said Juliana was not only out of work but, because she was still breastfeeding her youngest child, she also feared losing the treatment she needed. Previously, the World Health Organization (WHO) said eight countries - Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Haiti and Ukraine - could soon run out of HIV drugs after the US funding pause. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that disruption to HIV programmes \"could undo 20 years of progress\". In February, South Africa's leading Aids lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), warned the country could see a return to when HIV patients struggled to access necessary services for their treatment. \"We can't afford to die, we can't afford to go back to those years where we were suffering with access to services, especially for people living with HIV treatment,\" said TAC chair Sibongile Tshabalala. Ms Byanyima also proposed a deal to the Trump administration, offering an opportunity to market a new US-developed ARV to millions of people. Lenacapavir, made by US company Gilead, is given by injection every six months, with UNAids believing 10 million people could benefit from it. The profits and jobs resulting from such a deal would be hugely beneficial to the US, Ms Byanyima added. UNAids is one of a number of UN agencies facing funding cuts. The UN Refugee Agency has suggested it may have to lose 6,000 jobs, while Unicef has warned that progress to reduce child mortality is threatened, and the World Food Programme has had to cut rations in famine threatened regions.

        "title": "Trump bemoans a painting of him - but gets a new one from Putin",
        "content": "A likeness of Trump hanging in the Colorado state legislature attracted his ire US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as \"truly the worst\". The new portrait has not been shown publicly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as a \"personal gift\", adding that only Putin himself could disclose further details.  Meanwhile, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise an earlier picture of him that hung in the Colorado State Capitol building until it was removed on Monday. The US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of the new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington.  He described the work as a painting - a \"beautiful portrait\" by a \"leading Russian artist\" - but gave no further critique. Trump was \"clearly touched by it\", he added. The gift was confirmed by Peskov, as American and Russian negotiators again sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia as part of Trump's drive to end the war in Ukraine.  The gift highlights the diplomatic thaw between the two nations after Trump returned to the White House in January.  In an interview, Witkoff - who met Putin 10 days ago - said the Russian president had been \"gracious\". Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year. That attempt on Trump's life - which took place during a rally in Pennsylvania - gave rise to perhaps the most iconic image of him ever produced.  AP photographer Evan Vucci caught the moment that Trump, with a bloody ear, held up a defiant fist and told supporters to \"fight, fight, fight\". That image was further mythologised by Trump, who used it to adorn the cover of a book.  Decoding Donald Trump's new official portrait The 17th Century painting that unlocks Trump's portrait Dramatic images from rally at which Trump survived assassination effort Trump is yet to publicly comment on the image that was sent by Putin - but he left no doubt of the kind of portraiture he liked and disliked when delivering his views on the Colorado image. The painting, which was presented to the building in 2019, was \"purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before\", he wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning. That was unlike the same artist's depiction of Barack Obama, Trump wrote. Offering rare praise for his predecessor, Trump said Obama looked \"wonderful\" in his own portrait by the same artist, English-born Sarah Boardman. Trump reportedly lost up to 30lb (13.6kg) during last year's presidential campaign. He told reporters he had been \"so busy\" he had not \"been able to eat very much\".  The Republican also used the portrait to make a political point - describing Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, as \"radical\" and \"extremely weak on crime\". But the portrait had nothing to do with Polis, US media pointed out. It was instead the result of a crowdfunding campaign that was launched by a Republican. The portrait was reportedly commissioned to fill an empty space that had briefly been filled with an image of Vladimir Putin by a prankster. Following the backlash, a committee of leaders from both parties ordered the painting removed on Monday afternoon, according to a spokesman for Colorado's House Democrats. It will be kept in a secure location \"until further notice\".  The BBC has contacted Ms Boardman for comment. Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would \"always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.\"   Another portrait artist told the BBC he \"would have painted things slightly differently\", but that presidential portraits were nuanced, and he had sympathy for the artist. Robert Anderson, who created the official portrait of President George W Bush which hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery, said viewers tended to bring \"baggage\" depending on their feelings about the painting's subject.  For that reason, the reaction to an artwork often had \"very little to do with the quality of art\", he said.  Of Trump, Mr Anderson said: \"I think it would be very difficult to paint him because he has a particular impression of himself which might be very different to that of many others â probably at least half of the country.\" A spokesman for Polis told 9News said the governor was \"surprised to learn the president of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork\". The statement continued: \"We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\" Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US Reeves squeezes benefits as 2025 growth forecast halved Trump officials attack journalist after Signal leak published in full  Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game 'On the backs of the poor' and 'tax rise fears' Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on leaked Signal thread Why leaving his own charity will matter so much to Prince Harry China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters Local elections 2025: Is there an election in my area?

        "title": "Netflix's Adolescence makes UK TV ratings history",
        "content": "Owen Cooper and Stephen Graham have been widely praised for their performances in Adolescence Netflix drama Adolescence has become the first streaming show to top the UK's weekly TV ratings, beating BBC shows like The Apprentice and Death in Paradise in the latest official rankings., external The first episode of Adolescence was watched by 6.45 million people in its first week, according to ratings body Barb. That is the biggest audience for any streaming TV show in the UK in a single week, beating the 6.3 million who watched Fool Me Once on Netflix in January 2024. Adolescence's achievement in breaking the dominance of the traditional broadcasters at the top of the UK's weekly TV ratings will be seen as another milestone in the growth of Netflix and streaming. The second episode of Adolescence was seen by 5.94 million, with BBC One's The Apprentice and Death in Paradise third and fourth respectively in the weekly chart with almost 5.8 million each. Adolescence's third episode was fifth in the weekly ratings with 5.14 million, while the fourth and final instament was seen by 4.65 million. About 17 million UK homes have Netflix subscriptions. Adolescence quickly became the most talked-about show of the year so far after it launched on 13 March. It won acclaim from critics and viewers for its hard-hitting story of a 13-year-old boy who is arrested on suspicion of murdering a girl from his school, with the drama made more intense by filming each episode in a single shot. Its cast has come in for particular praise, including newcomer Owen Cooper as young Jamie, and Stephen Graham as his dad. The show has also sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 5 Live in an interview broadcast on Monday: \"There's a reason why the debate has suddenly sparked into life - a lot of people who work with young people at school or elsewhere, recognise that we may have a problem with boys and young men that we need to address.\" Adolescence is now among the programmes with the highest seven-day ratings so far this year, behind the BBC's The Traitors, Call The Midwife and the Gavin & Stacey: A Fond Farewell documentary. ITV's drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which similarly made headlines and set the political agenda last year, was watched by 10 million people in its first week. Barb began including streaming data in its ratings in November 2021.

        "title": "South Sudan clashes: UN fears civil war as barrel bombs dropped in Upper Nile",
        "content": "The White Army militia fought alongside Vice-President Riek Machar during the civil war that broke out in 2013 Barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid have been used in airstrikes in South Sudan as escalating violence pushes the world's newest country to the brink of another civil war, the UN has said. The comments by Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, follow recent fighting between the army and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, at a military base in the northern town of Nasir in oil-rich Upper Nile State. Since the White Army overran the base, there had been persistent aerial bombardment causing \"significant casualties and horrific burns\", he said. \"A conflict would erase all the hard-won gains made since the 2018 peace deal was signed,\" he warned. \"It would devastate not only South Sudan but the entire region, which simply cannot afford another war,\" Mr Haysom said, external. The government has not responded to the barrel bomb allegations. President Salva Kiir and his rival Vice-President Riek Machar agreed in August 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence. In early March, several of Machar's most senior allies were arrested by security forces, which his allies called a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal. This followed the clashes between the military and the White Army, which fought alongside Machar during the civil war that erupted in 2013 - not long after the country had gained its independence from Sudan. \"In retaliation, communities across Upper Nile are being subjected to persistent aerial bombardment using devices, barrel bombs, allegedly containing a highly flammable liquid that acts as an accelerant on explosion,\" Mr Haysom said. \"These indiscriminate attacks on civilians are causing significant casualties and horrific injuries, especially burns.\" Such allegations were first made last week by local leaders in Upper Nile. James Gatluak Lew, Nasir county commissioner, told the BBC that state forces and their allies had carried out \"chemical bombardments\". Local media reported that ethyl acetate, a highly flammable chemical compound, was found at the attack sites. In an earlier interview with the BBC, Edmund Yakani, the head of a local non-governmental organisation, said he had heard similar reports. Eyewitnesses, including local community leaders and business informants, had told his Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (CEPO) about the use of \"unusual weapons\", he said. Government spokesman Michael Makuei confirmed there had been a military operation in Upper Nile last week, insisting \"the bombardment was strictly against White Army positions and did not harm civilians\". But Mr Haysom said civilians, including women and children, had been greatly affected, with an estimated 63,000 people forced to flee their homes. He added that such violence was escalating as the country drew closer to elections, expected next year. \"Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\" he said. The UN mission, which oversees an estimated 18,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, was engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy to try and prevent a return to civil war, Mr Haysom added. Meanwhile, Machar has accused neighbouring Uganda of violating the UN arms embargo on South Sudan by conducting airstrikes in the country. In a letter seen by the Reuters news agency and addressed to the UN, the African Union and the regional bloc Igad, Machar said Uganda's military intervention in South Sudan had violated the peace deal. \"The Ugandan forces are currently taking part in air strikes against civilians in counties of Nasir, Longechuk and Ulang in Upper Nile State, and Akobo County in Jonglei State,\" it said. Earlier this month, Uganda said it had deployed troops to South Sudan at the request of President Kiir's government, though Juba has denied this.

        "title": "JD Vance to accompany wife on Greenland trip",
        "content": "Denmark has welcomed changes to a Greenland trip by US Vice-President JD Vance and his wife Usha, which has been reduced to a visit of just a US space base. Earlier this week, it was announced that Usha Vance would spend several days in Greenland, visiting the capital Nuuk and attending cultural events like a popular annual dogsled race.  The White House said on Tuesday that JD Vance would join his wife in Greenland but that the couple would only spend a day there visiting the US Pituffik Space Base, on the north-western coast. US President Donald Trump has continued his threats of taking over Greenland, a Danish semi-autonomous territory, saying on Wednesday: \"We're going to have to have it\". \"We need Greenland for international safety and security,\" Trump added. Although JD Vance will become the highest-ranking US official to visit Greenland,  a visit to a US base is less controversial than the original plan for his wife's visit, which Greenland's acting head of government Mute Egede called a \"provocation\". Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that the decision was \"very positive\" and that Denmark had \"nothing against\" the Americans visiting their own base. Rasmussen also said it was a \"masterful spin in many ways, to make [the US] look like they're escalating when they're actually deescalating.\" The revised programme will also likely reduce the risk of the Vances being met with protests by local residents.  In recent weeks hundreds of people have taken part in demonstrations against the US, with some holding placards reading \"Respect international agreements\" and \"Yankee go home\". Earlier in March, Greenland's leading political parties issued a joint statement to condemn Trump's \"unacceptable behaviour\".  Outgoing Prime Minister Mute B Egede wrote on Facebook that his country would \"never be the USA and we Greenlanders will never be Americans... Don't keep treating us with disrespect. Enough is enough.\" People took part in a demonstration outside the US consulate in Nuuk earlier in March On Wednesday morning, Greenland media reported that several armoured cars which had arrived on the island in preparation for Usha Vance's visit were being loaded back on an American military plane. Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years. It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest and a military presence there since World War Two. The Pituffik Space Base, located in the north-west of Greenland, supports missile warning, air defence and space surveillance missions.  In a video posted on social media platform X on Tuesday, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland. He is joining her because he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself\".  He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\". He added that the Trump administration wanted to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".  It is unclear if Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz is still scheduled to visit. The BBC has reached out to the White House for confirmation. Is Greenland For Sale? US president Donald Trump says he wants the US to take over Greenland. Many people think it will never happen. But could it? If so, how? This video can not be played Watch: Danish journalist on what Greenlanders think about Trump's comments Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticised the visit.  He said it was \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.  The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.  \"Disrespecting the people of Greenland by saying the US will acquire it 'one way or the other' is unhelpful and counter-productive as a tactic,\" he added.  According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.

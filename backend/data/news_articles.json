        "title": "Lab-grown food could be sold in UK in two years",
        "content": "This lab-grown Wagyu steak is ready to eat, but can't be sold in the UK because it has not yet been approved  Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected.  The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods. Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants. UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations. Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month. In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year. However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans. The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers.  It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting. But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest. The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time. Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety. \"We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,\" he said. But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach. \"The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,\" she said. The cells are grown in fermentation tanks and then processed to look like food The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as \"deregulation\".  \"It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,\" he told BBC News. \"It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication.\" Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier. The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth.  The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures. Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows. The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait. \"If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive.\" These lab-grown crystals look like sugar and are much sweeter Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet.  It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks. In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval. \"The path to getting approval is not straightforward,\" she tells me.  \"They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like.\" The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods.  Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right. \"It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them.\" But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold. \"Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,\" he said. \"And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

        "title": "Scientists discover new part of the immune system",
        "content": "A new part of the immune system has been discovered and it is a goldmine of potential antibiotics, scientists have said. They've shown a part of the body known to recycle proteins has a secret mode that can spew out an arsenal of bacteria-killing chemicals. The researchers in Israel say it transforms our understanding of how we are protected against infection. And gives a new place to look for antibiotics to tackle the growing problem of superbugs that resist our current drugs. The discovery centres on the proteasome â a tiny structure that is found in every cell of the body. Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones. But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, external, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria. It then changes structure and role. It starts transforming old proteins into weapons that can rip open the outer layer of bacteria to kill them. Staphylococcus bacteria, one healthy on the left and one being destroyed as its outer layer is torn open by antimicrobials made by the proteasome.  Prof Yifat Merbl, from the Weizmann Institute of Science, told me: \"This is really exciting, because we never knew that this was happening. \"We discovered a novel mechanism of immunity that is allowing us to have a defence against bacterial infection. \"It's happening throughout our body in all the cells, and generates a whole new class of potential natural antibiotics.\" The research team went through a process they called \"dumpster diving\" to find these natural antibiotics. They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics. And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.   Prof Yifat Merbl, centre in black, with the rest of her lab team Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection. \"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\" But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time. More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.  Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand. Against that bleak background, having somewhere new to look is a source of optimism for some scientists.  Dr Lindsey Edwards, a senior lecturer in microbiology at King's College London, told the BBC: \"It's a potential goldmine for new antibiotics, that's quite exciting. \"In previous years it's been digging up soil [to find new antibiotics], it is wild that it's something we have within us, but comes down to having the technology to be able to detect these things.\" She also says there could be fewer issues with developing them into drugs because they are already products of the human body so the \"safety side of it might be a lot easier\".

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Smiles and hugs as new crew arrives on ISS A SpaceX capsule carrying a new crew has docked at the International Space Station (ISS), paving the way for astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to come home. The pair were due to be on the ISS for only eight days, but because of technical issues with the experimental spacecraft they arrived on, they have been there for more than nine months. The astronauts are due to begin their journey back to Earth later this week. Steve Stich, manager of Nasa's commercial crew programme said he was delighted at the prospect. \"Butch and Suni have done a great job and we are excited to bring them back,\" he said. Watch: How two astronauts were left in space for nine months Nasa astronauts Butch and Suni's homecoming delayed again Why are the Boeing Starliner astronauts still in space? Live footage showed the SpaceX Crew Dragon docking with the ISS and opening a hatch. Shortly after 0545 GMT, the astronauts embraced and hugged their counterparts. The astronauts, along with their ISS workmates, Nasa's Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will be relieved by four astronauts, from Russia, Japan and two from the US. There will be a two-day handover after which the old crew are due to begin their journey back to Earth. But there could be a small further delay, as they wait for conditions on Earth to be right for a safe re-entry of the returning capsule, according to Dana Weigel, manager, of the ISS programme. \"Weather always has to cooperate, so we'll take our time over that if it is not favourable,\" she told reporters. Ms Weigel explained that the astronauts had begun getting ready for the handover last week. \"Butch rang a ceremonial bell as Suni handed over command to cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin,\" she said. The astronauts all embraced and hugged their counterparts Suni Williams describes being in space as her \"happy place\" The astronauts have consistently said that they have been happy to be on board the space station, with Suni Williams describing it as her \"happy place\". But Dr Simeon Barber, of the Open University, told BBC News that there would likely have been a personal cost. \"When you are sent on a work trip that is supposed to last a week, you are not expecting it to take the best part of a year,\" he said. \"This extended stay in space will have disrupted family life, things will have happened back home that they will have missed out on, so there will have been a period of upheaval.\" Butch and Suni arrived at the ISS at the beginning of June 2024 to test an experimental spacecraft called Starliner, which was built by the aerospace firm Boeing, a rival to SpaceX.  The mission had been delayed by several years because of technical issues in the spacecraft's development, and there were problems during its launch and docking on to the ISS. This included issues with some of Starliner's thrusters, which would be needed to slow the spacecraft for re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, and leaks of helium gas in the propulsion system. Astronauts Suni Williams (left) and Butch Wilmore were supposed to have stayed on the space station for eight days Nasa decided that it would not take even a small risk in bringing back Butch and Suni on Starliner, when they had the option of returning them on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Nasa decided the best option was to do this during a scheduled crew rotation, even though it would mean keeping the astronauts on the space station for several months. Boeing has consistently argued that it would have been safe to bring Butch and Suni back on Starliner, and were unhappy about the decision to use a rival's capsule instead, which will be \"embarrassing\" for Boeing, according to Dr Barber. \"It's not a good look for Boeing to see astronauts they took into space come back in a competitor's craft.\" Artwork: five of Starliner's Maneuvering thrusters stalled while docking on to the ISS Both President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk have said that Butch and Suni could have been brought home sooner, most recently in a joint interview with Fox News in February, external. President Trump states: \"They got left in space.\" When the interviewer,  Sean Hannity, elaborates, saying \"They were supposed to be there eight days. They're there almost 300,\" Mr Trump responds with one word: \"Biden.\" Mr Musk follows up asserting: \"They were left up there for political reasons.\" The assertion is denied by Nasa's Steve Stitch. \"We looked at a wide range of options and worked hand-in-hand with SpaceX to look at what was the best thing to do overall and when we laid all that out the best option was to have the one we are embarking upon,\" he said. That decision was supported by Dr Libby Jackson, who is head of space at the Science Museum in London and worked at Europe's control centre for the ISS. \"Butch and Suni's wellbeing would always have been at the very forefront of everybody's minds as the decisions were being made for how best to deal with the circumstances that they were presented,\" she said. \"Nasa made those decisions based on good technical reasons, on programmatic reasons, and found the right solution that has kept Butch and Suni safe. \"I really look forward to seeing them return to Earth, safe and sound, along with the rest of their crewmates.\" Trump suggests US could run Ukraine's power plants during Zelensky call UK to host new Ukraine peacekeeping talks British bomb disposal expert injured in Gaza Private notes and emails reveal inside story of hospital struggle to stop Lucy Letby 'Biggest cuts since austerity' and 'evil' family killer You're hired: Lord Sugar signs up to stay on The Apprentice into his 80s Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk Whistleblower reveals oil giant's 'awful' pollution Royal Mail launches mythical creatures stamp collection What nine months in space does to the human body  'It's him, it's him!' - Mother spots son deported from US in mega-prison footage Politics Essential: Get the latest news and analysis delivered to your inbox every weekday Ten Pound Poms, starring Michelle Keegan, has returned A unique, wild trip through extremes of mind and body Uncovering the dark side of football hooliganism Exposing the truth to bring a serial killer to justice Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Afghan women students in Oman face expulsion after Trump's USAID freeze",
        "content": "Afghan women students in Oman say they expect to be sent back within weeks More than 80 Afghan women who fled the Taliban to pursue higher education in Oman now face imminent return back to Afghanistan, following the Trump administration's sweeping cuts to foreign aid programmes. Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), their scholarships were abruptly terminated after a funding freeze ordered by President Donald Trump when he returned to office in January. \"It was heart-breaking,\" one student told the BBC, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. \"Everyone was shocked and crying. We've been told we will be sent back within two weeks.\"  Since regaining power nearly four years ago, the Taliban has imposed draconian restrictions on women, including banning them from universities.  The Trump administration's aid freeze has faced legal roadblocks, but thousands of humanitarian programmes around the world have already been terminated as the White House dismantles USAID and cuts tens of billions of dollars in spending. The students in Oman say preparations are under way to return them to Afghanistan, and have appealed to the international community to \"intervene urgently\". The BBC has seen emails sent to the 82 students informing them that their scholarships have been \"discontinued\" due to the termination of the programme and USAID funding. The emails - which acknowledge the news will be \"profoundly disappointing and unsettling\" - refer to travel arrangements back to Afghanistan, which caused alarm among the students. US cuts send South Africa's HIV treatment 'off a cliff' \"We need immediate protection, financial assistance and resettlement opportunities to a safe country where we can continue our education,\" one told the BBC. The USAID website's media contact page remains offline. The BBC has contacted the US State Department for comment.  The Afghan women, now facing a forced return from Oman, had been pursuing graduate and post-graduate courses under the Women's Scholarship Endowment (WSE), a USAID programme which began in 2018. It provided scholarships for Afghan women to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the disciplines banned for women by the Taliban.  The Afghan women who escaped to get an education abroad Exhibition giving Afghan women and girls a voice Afghan women 'banned from midwife courses' in latest blow to rights Just over a week ago, the students were told their scholarships had been terminated. \"It's like everything has been taken away from me,\" another student told the BBC. \"It was the worst moment. I'm under extreme stress right now.\" These women, mostly aged in their 20s, qualified for scholarships in 2021 before the Taliban seized Afghanistan. Many continued their studies in Afghan universities until December 2022, when the Taliban banned higher education for women. After 18 months in limbo, they said they fled to Pakistan last September. USAID then facilitated their visas to Oman, where they arrived between October and November 2024. \"If we are sent back, we will face severe consequences. It would mean losing all our dreams,\" a student said. \"We won't be able to study and our families might force us to get married. Many of us could also be at personal risk due to our past affiliations and activism.\"  The Taliban has cracked down on women protesting for education and work, with many activists beaten, detained and threatened. Women in Afghanistan describe themselves as \"dead bodies moving around\" under the regime's brutal policies. The Taliban government says it has been trying to resolve the issue of women's education, but has also defended its supreme leader's diktats, saying they are \"in accordance with Islamic Sharia law\". \"Afghanistan is experiencing gender apartheid, with women systematically excluded from basic rights, including education,\" a student said. She and her friends in Oman had managed to escape that fate, as the scholarships were supposed to fund their education until 2028. \"When we came here, our sponsors told us to not go back to Afghanistan till 2028 for vacations or to visit our families because it's not safe for us. And now they're telling us to go,\" a student said.  Last month, White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly blamed the situation for Afghan women on the US military's withdrawal from the country under the Democrats, telling the Washington Post: \"Afghan women are suffering because Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal allowed the Taliban to impose mediaeval Sharia law policies.\" The decision to slash American aid funding has come under the Trump administration, and been implemented by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. And these women face a grim future, urgently seeking a lifeline before time runs out.

        "title": "' largest' fusion fuel facility to be built",
        "content": "The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is based in Culham A facility designed to store and recover a fuel used for nuclear fusion is set to be built. United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and Italian energy company Eni have partnered to construct the facility - thought to be the world's largest - at the Culham science campus in Oxfordshire. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen which is heated and forced together to make a heavier particle during nuclear fusion. The new tritium fuel cycle facility, which will recover and re-use the particles, is due to be completed in 2028. Nuclear fusion is the energy process that powers the stars, with scientists saying it has the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The fusion process sees two hydrogen isotopes, such as tritium, fuse together under intense heat and pressure to form a helium atom - releasing large amounts of emissions-free energy. The new facility is due to be completed by 2028 UKAEA said tritium recovery and re-use would play a \"fundamental role\" in the \"supply and generation of the fuel in future fusion power plants\" and be \"crucial in making the technology increasingly efficient\". Kerry McCarthy, government climate minister, said the new facility would \"not only position the UK as a leader in the development of fusion fuel technologies\" but also \"accelerate progress towards a future of safe, sustainable, and abundant clean energy\". UKAEA added the site had been designed to \"serve as a world-class facility\", providing the opportunity to study how to process, store and recycle tritium. Prof Sir Ian Chapman, chief executive of UKAEA, said the agency believed that fusion energy could \"contribute to a net zero future, including going beyond the decarbonisation of electricity\". He said the new plant would \"set a benchmark which would be paving the way for innovative offerings in fusion fuel\". Culham was previously home to a nuclear fusion reactor, which in its final test produced a record amount of energy. The reactor was decommissioned in 2024, with the government hoping to build the world's first fusion power plant in Nottinghamshire â which would begin operation in the 2040s.

        "title": "Tesco trials giant trolley scales in Gateshead",
        "content": "A Reddit user posted a picture of the new scales in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store Giant trolley scales are being trialled at a Tesco store in Gateshead sparking a mixed reaction from shoppers. Trolleys are weighed before checkout to identify any items customers who have used Scan as you Shop might have missed or scanned twice. But some shoppers are unsure whether the new technology will take off with some likening it to airport security. \"Am I at border control or Tesco?\" one Reddit user posted, while another joked \"No clubcard? Deported!\" Others questioned whether the scales were aimed at cracking down on self-scan shoplifters or cutting back on checkout staff. Tesco declined to comment. Tesco Clubcard members already have the option to use Scan as you Shop handsets as they fill their trolleys then check out and pay at the end. Now in the Gateshead Trinity Square Extra store, shoppers can push their trolley on to the scales and if the weight matches the items they've scanned they pay as normal. If there is a discrepancy a staff member will do a manual rescan of the whole trolley. Although some Reddit users who commented on the photo of the scales were positive with one saying \"they are 10x more convenient and faster\", many were more critical of their introduction. \"More and more the honest shopper is treated like a thief,\" one said, while another wrote \"the point of all this is to save on staff\". Business retail consultant Ged Futter told the BBC this was about loss prevention and staffing costs. \"There is no way this is about making it quicker for the shopper. It's supposed to be scan and go - this is scan and stop while your trolley is weighed.\" He said self-scan had increased the rate of shoplifting but instead of putting staff back on tills, supermarkets were trying to use even more technology to stop thefts. \"This is supermarkets saying, 'we know there are thefts so what we are going to do is treat every customer in exactly the same way to reduce theft'. \"They're forgetting that trust is the most important thing for all of the retailers and it works both ways. If customers don't feel trusted or think they're being treated like thieves they will go somewhere else.\" Tesco has already invested heavily in Scan as you Shop technology The British Retail Consortium has said shoplifting is \"out of control\" after its annual crime survey found incidents of customer theft reported by retailers in the UK rose by 3.7 million to 20.4 million, and cost retailers Â£2bn. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics revealed shoplifting offences reported by police in England and Wales rose by 23% to more than 492,000 over the same period. That is the highest figure since current recording practices began in 2003. Retail criminologist Prof Emmeline Taylor told the BBC she had seen similar trolley scales used in European supermarkets and there was \"definitely an element of trying to control loss\" but added \"let's not forget a lot of scan and go loss can be accidental\". A random audit of 20,000 scan and go baskets found 43% had at least one error, external, a 2022 global study on self-checkout found. Prof Taylor said Tesco's scales were \"quite foreboding and reminiscent of security scanners\". \"They don't want to give the impression that they are pointing the finger at their honest customer,\" she said. \"They will need to balance how they respond when there is a weight discrepancy because you can lose a customer for life if they feel they've been wrongly accused of something.\" She said she could see customers getting frustrated using the scales. \"You've left your handbag in the trolley, you've got to take your child out of the seat, you might be queueing behind someone who has been stopped and you can't get through so the trial needs to focus on minimising friction points in the customer experience.\" The scales are the latest example of supermarkets turning to technology to streamline time and costs. The ratio of self-scan to staffed tills continues to be fiercely debated. Some shoppers love the speed and convenience while others are fed up of hearing \"unexpected item in the bagging area\". In August upmarket north of England supermarket chain Booths got rid of self-scan altogether, while Asda and Morrisons said they would put more staff back on manned tills.

        "title": "Plane GPS systems are under sustained attack - is the solution a new atomic clock? - BBC News",
        "content": "Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe? As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank â though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated, external that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. NPL's atomic clock, alongside clocks from around 80 labs worldwide, helps set Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the official global time standard To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at Â£1.4bn each day , externalâ no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists â dubbed the \"Time Lords\" â has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself â all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking â and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem â and the impact could be at least as transformative. \"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. John Harrison's marine clock revolutionised navigation, paving the way for global trade and exploration The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. \"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. \"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over â though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS â¦ will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\" In March 2024, the then Defence Secretary Grant Shapps experienced GPS jamming first-hand when his plane lost signal while flying near Russian territory While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around Â£100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is disrupting British military operations in conflict zones like Ukraine, posing serious challenges GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. \"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out. \"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship â his greatest difficulty was to make it small. Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa? But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.  \"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist. \"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy â transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

        "title": "The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain, thanks to Elon Musk",
        "content": "Having a chip in your brain that can translate your thoughts into computer commands may sound like science fiction - but it is a reality for Noland Arbaugh.  In January 2024 - eight years after he was paralysed - the 30-year-old became the first person to get such a device from the US neurotechnology firm, Neuralink. It was not the first such chip - a handful of other companies have also developed and implanted them - but Noland's inevitably attracts more attention because of Neuralink's founder: Elon Musk. But Noland says the important thing is neither him nor Musk - but the science. He told the BBC he knew the risks of what he was doing - but \"good or bad, whatever may be, I would be helping\". \"If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink,\" he said. \"If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it.\" Noland, who is from Arizona, was paralysed below the shoulders in a diving accident in 2016. His injuries were so severe he feared he might not be able to study, work or even play games again. \"You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,\" he said. \"You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.\" The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind. It is what is known as a brain computer interface (BCI) - which works by detecting the tiny electrical impulses generated when humans think about moving, and translating these into digital command, such as moving a cursor on a screen. It is a complex subject that scientists have been working on for several decades.  'My name is Chris': The tech turning thoughts into speech Can Musk's Neuralink brain chip really change the world? Inevitably, Elon Musk's involvement in the field has catapulted the tech - and Noland Arbaugh - into the headlines. It's helped Neuralink attract lots of investment - as well as scrutiny over the safety and significance of what is an extremely invasive procedure. When Noland's implant was announced, experts hailed it as a \"significant milestone\", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk's adeptness at \"generating publicity for his company.\" Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\" In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic. \"I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,\" he said. Nonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it \"an Elon Musk device\". Whether the rest of the world sees it that way - especially given his increasingly controversial role in the US government - remains to be seen. But there is no questioning the impact the device has had on Noland's life. Nolandâs mum (left), dad and cousin with him in hospital after his surgery When Noland awoke from the surgery which installed the device, he said he was initially able to control a cursor on a screen by thinking about wiggling his fingers.  \"Honestly I didn't know what to expect - it sounds so sci-fi,\" he said. But after seeing his neurons spike on a screen - all the while surrounded by excited Neuralink employees - he said \"it all sort of sunk in\" that he could control his computer with just his thoughts. And - even better - over time his ability to use the implant has grown to the point he can now play chess and video games. \"I grew up playing games,\" he said - adding it was something he \"had to let go of\" when he became disabled. \"Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible but it is.\"  Noland is a powerful demonstration of the tech's potential to change lives - but there may be drawbacks too. \"One of the main problems is privacy,\" said Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience, University of Sussex. \"So if we are exporting our brain activity [...] then we are kind of allowing access to not just what we do but potentially what we think, what we believe and what we feel,\" he told the BBC. \"Once you've got access to stuff inside your head, there really is no other barrier to personal privacy left.\" This video can not be played Noland played a game of online chess using his Neuralink BCI on a livestream on X in March 2024, alongside the company's brain interface software lead Bliss Chapman. But these aren't concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do. He told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot. Even with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn't all been smooth sailing though. At one point, an issue with the device caused him to lose control of his computer altogether, when it partially disconnected from his brain. \"That was really upsetting to say the least,\" he said. \"I didn't know if I would be able to use Neuralink ever again.\" The connection was repaired - and subsequently improved - when engineers adjusted the software, but it highlighted a concern frequently voiced by experts over the technology's limitations. Neuralink is just one of many companies exploring how to digitally tap into our brain power. Synchron is one such firm, which says its Stentrode device aimed at helping people with  motor neurone disease requires a less invasive surgery to implant. Rather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person's jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel. Like Neuralink, the device ultimately connects to the motor region of the brain. \"It picks up when someone is thinking of tapping or not tapping their finger,\" said chief technology officer Riki Bannerjee. \"By being able to pick up those differences it can create what we call a digital motor output.\" That output is then turned into computer signals, where it is currently being used by 10 people. One such person, who did not want his last name to be used, told the BBC he was the first person in the world to use the device with Apple's Vision Pro headset. Mark said this has allowed him to virtually holiday in far-flung locations - from standing in waterfalls in Australia to strolling across mountains in New Zealand. \"I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,\" he said. But for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.  Whatever happens to him, he believes his experience may be merely scratching the surface of what might one day become a reality. \"We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,\" he said.

        "content": "Singapore's biggest bank, DBS, says it expects to cut about 4,000 roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) takes on more work currently done by humans. The move will affect temporary and contract staff, a bank spokesperson said, with the reduction in the workforce coming from \"natural attrition\" as projects are completed. Permanent staff are not affected by the cuts. The bank's outgoing chief executive Piyush Gupta also said it expected to create around 1,000 new AI-related jobs. It makes DBS one of the first major banks to offer details on how AI will affect its operations. The company did not say how many jobs would be cut in Singapore. \"Over the next three years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects,\" the DBS spokesperson said. \"As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\" DBS currently has between 8,000 and 9,000 temporary and contract workers. The bank employs a total of around 41,000 people. Last year, Mr Gupta said DBS had been working on AI for over a decade. \"We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases, and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn ($745m; Â£592m) in 2025,\" he added. Mr Gupta is set to leave the firm at the end of March. Current deputy chief executive Tan Su Shan will replace him. The ongoing proliferation of AI technology has put its benefits and risks under the spotlight, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying in 2024 that it is set to affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide. The IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that \"in most scenarios, AI will likely worsen overall inequality\". The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told the BBC last year that AI will not be a \"mass destroyer of jobs\" and human workers will learn to work with new technologies. Mr Bailey said that while there are risks with AI, \"there is great potential with it\".

        "content": "The settlement with thousands of people who have worked at the tech giant has received preliminary approval Google has agreed to pay $28m (Â£21.5m) to settle a lawsuit that claimed white and Asian employees were given better pay and career opportunities than workers from other ethnic backgrounds, a law firm representing claimants says. The technology giant confirmed it had \"reached a resolution\" but rejected the allegations made against it. The case filed in 2021 by former Google employee, Ana Cantu, said workers from Hispanic, Latino, Native American and other backgrounds started on lower salaries and job levels than their white and Asian counterparts. The settlement has been given preliminary approval by Judge Charles Adams of the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California. The case brought by Ms Cantu against Google relied on a leaked internal document, which allegedly showed that employees from some ethnic backgrounds reported lower compensation for similar work. The practice of basing starting pay and job level on prior salaries reinforced historical race and ethnicity-based disparities, according to Ms Cantu's lawyers. The class action lawsuit was filed for at least 6,632 people who were employed by Google between 15 February 2018 and 31 December 2024, according to Reuters news agency. Cathy Coble, one of the lawyers representing them, praised the \"bravery of both the diverse and ally Googlers who self-reported their pay and leaked that data to the media\". \"Suspected pay inequity is too easily concealed without this kind of collective action from employees,\" Ms Coble added. The technology giant denied that it had discriminated against any of its employees. \"We reached a resolution, but continue to disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone differently, and remain committed to paying, hiring, and levelling all employees fairly,\" a Google spokesperson told the BBC. Earlier this year, Google joined a growing list of US firms that are abandoning commitments to principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their recruitment policies. Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others have also rolled back their DEI programmes. It comes as US President Donald Trump and his allies have regularly attacked DEI policies.

        "title": "Trump 'strongly considering' large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Trump says 'may be easier dealing' with Russia than Ukraine US President Donald Trump has said he is \"strongly considering large-scale sanctions\" and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire and peace deal with Ukraine is reached. Trump said he was contemplating the move because \"Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now\". Trump's comments marked a sharp change in tone. Since coming into office, he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and blamed Ukraine's leader for not wanting peace with Russia.  Hours later, however, the US president told reporters he was \"finding it more difficult to deal with Ukraine\", and repeated that he trusted Putin. Last Friday, Trump berated Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Days earlier, he had even called him a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war which began on 24 February 2022 when Putin launched a full-scale invasion of the neighbouring country. The public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv.  It is not clear if this enabled Russia's large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Thursday night. On Friday morning, Trump issued his threat of sanctions tariffs against Russia - apparently over the attack. \"They [Russia] are bombing the hell out of them [Ukraine] right now... and I put a statement out, a very strong statement 'can't do that, can't do that',\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. Asked if that was a result of the US pause in military co-operation with Ukraine, Trump said Putin was doing \"what anyone else would do\". And he justified the US move by saying: \"I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle.\"   Zelensky hopes US-Ukraine talks next week will be 'meaningful'  The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work? In Friday's post, Trump wrote: \"I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late.\" He did not provide any details as to how such sanctions and tariffs against Russia may work. Moscow is already under the heaviest Western sanctions in its history, many of which target its oil exports and foreign currency reserves.  It has been able to get around them to a large extent by selling discounted oil to India and China, while importing many of the goods it previously got from the West through countries like Kazakhstan.  China is reported to be helping to sustain Russia's war effort with large volumes of dual-use technology, which it denies. The White House administration cannot have failed to notice the chorus of criticism that all the pressure for a peace deal is being piled on just Ukraine, not Russia. So it is possible that Trump's threat is an attempt to present itself as being more even-handed.  The problem is, we simply do not know what was discussed and what was agreed in that \"lengthy and highly productive\" 90-minute phone call that Donald Trump suddenly announced he had held last month with the Russian president.  So far, Vladimir Putin has played a clever hand, sitting back and doubtless enjoying watching the transatlantic alliance come apart at the seams.  Compared to that gain, the threat of US tariffs is unlikely to bother him unduly.

        "title": "Harvard offers free tuition for families making less than $200,000",
        "content": "The school is one of several elite institutions that have tried to expand financial aid as the cost of college soars Harvard University has announced that it is making tuition free for families who earn less than $200,000 (Â£154,000) a year. For families earning less than $100,000, Harvard will also cover expenses like housing and health insurance. The move is aimed at making Harvard more affordable for middle-income families, and it comes as the Trump administration targets university funding as a part of a crackdown on diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. \"Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences,Â andÂ perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual andÂ personal growth,\" said Harvard President Alan Garber. The policy - which will begin in the 2025 to 2026 academic year - will help \"make a Harvard College education possible for every admitted student\", Garber added.  The Ivy League school said the move will allow roughly 86% of US families to qualify for Harvard's financial aid. The median household income in the US was $80,000 in 2023, according to the US Census.  In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on A number of elite universities in the US have taken similar steps in recent years, including the University of Pennsylvania and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which also have free tuition for families making less than $200,000.  Harvard had previously made all university costs, including housing and medical care, free for families with incomes under $85,000.  The average price of a private university in the US for those living on campus is $58,000 per academic year, according to the Education Data Initiative. The average cost of college has more than doubled since 2001, the research group found.  The financial aid expansions come as the Trump administration has threatened to pull funding from universities over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, research and coursework that they allege is a form of racial discrimination.  Under Trump, the Department of Education has said it is investigating 52 universities across the country for alleged \"racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities\" as Trump attempts to get rid of DEI programmes.  The Trump administration has already pulled $400m in grants and contracts from Columbia University, alleging the Ivy League school failed to prevent antisemitism on campus as protests grew over Israel's war in Gaza.  Last year, the US Supreme Court voted to overturn affirmative action. The practice favoured individuals in disadvantaged groups to help eliminate discrimination against marginalised applicants during the enrollment process and increase diversity among students.  Universities across the US have reported a decline in racial diversity since the court's decision.

        "title": "Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK",
        "content": "Vanya Gaberova, Katrin Ivanova and Tihomir Ivanchev were found guilty of conspiracy to spy Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as \"one of the largest\" foreign intelligence operations in the UK.  Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would \"expect to see in a spy novel\", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy. How spy ring living double lives did Kremlin's dirty work  Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents. They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.  Here police found a \"treasure trove\" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment. They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his \"minions\", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial. The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as \"hooked and in love\" with her in WhatsApp messages. Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. Clockwise from top left: Orlin Roussev, Katrin Ivanova, Ivan Stoyanov, Biser Dzhambazov, Vanya Gaberova and Tihomir Ivanchev During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was \"sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information\". The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity. Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an \"extremely sophisticated\" operation that \"posed a threat to national security and individuals\". Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard.  The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an \"intermediary for the Russian intelligence services\". Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations. This video can not be played Orlin Roussev was arrested by police in a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth. Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm.  Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname \"The Destroyer\". Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on \"British values\". But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova â they were found in bed together when police made arrests â and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past. During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia. Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5. The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies: Operation 1 This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev. Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria. The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him. Operation 2 This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national. The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat. At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone. Operation 3 This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard. Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum. There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard. Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance. Operation 4 This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022. The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a \"fake protest\" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia. Operation 5 This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022. This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine. Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base. Operation 6 Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur. He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a \"foreign agent\" by Russia in November 2023.

        "title": "Lives at risk due to medical scan mistakes, says ombudsman",
        "content": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned.  The most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly. The ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again.  NHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\". In one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO). The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.  A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel. However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery. The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.  Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.  Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.  The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.  Failings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests.  The man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen.  \"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\" A statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made.  \"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\" The trust has also agreed to pay the family Â£4,000, as recommended by PHSO.  In another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise.  The patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday.  His brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it.  \"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\" The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital. However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy. He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous. If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said. While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life. His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\" In a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident. \"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\" The trust has agreed to pay the family Â£3,500.  Ms Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care.  \"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\" The 2021 ombudsman report, external into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\". It is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added. Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements.  \"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said.  \"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\" The college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028.  An NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\" The spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\". Changes were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.

        "title": "Lloyds, Halifax and TSB banking apps not working, thousands say",
        "content": "Banking apps have once again been hit by IT issues on payday in the UK. Lloyds Bank and Halifax apps went down on Friday morning, according to thousands of user reports to platform outage monitor Downdetector. Users also reported technical issues affecting access to the TSB and Bank of Scotland apps. The number of reports flagging problems with the apps has since declined. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson has told the BBC that the Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland apps and online banking services are now working as normal. The British banking giant apologised for the issues in an earlier statement. It is the second time in 2025 that banking apps users have encountered problems on payday, after a Barclays app outage affected UK customers in January. Which? retail editor Reena Sewraz said the IT problems \"could cause real headaches for thousands of customers\".  \"Some people may miss important bill payments, find themselves unable to pay for essential services or risk going overdrawn, all of which could have serious consequences,\" she said. One user told the Lloyd's Bank social media account on X that they could not access their business account to pay their staff, external.  Another said in a post tagging Lloyds Bank's X account they had been told to transfer funds into their account, but could not due to the issues affecting its app.  \"Your new cards have no phone numbers on and I'm nowhere near a branch,\" they wrote - adding \"help!\". Barclays customers told the BBC last month that their bank's outage, lasting several days for some, left them unable to purchase essentials or make vital transactions. \"I could cry. I changed to you when Barclays had a major breakdown on payday,\" one X user told Lloyds in a reply to one of their posts on Friday. \"Now this month you've gone down on payday,\" they added. The Treasury Committee recently wrote to the bosses of nine banks asking for information about the scale and impact of IT failures on customers. The latest bank IT problems highlight concerns about a shift towards mobile and internet banking services impeding peoples' access to physical cash and bank branches. Martin Quinn, the director of campaign group Campaign for Cash, said Friday's banking app issues demonstrated society's over-reliance on technology. \"This proves that now more than ever a strong bank branch network [is needed], as when outages happen, we need face-to-face banking,\" he told the BBC. Disability rights groups are also calling for access to physical cash to be protected. Meanwhile, Patrick Burgess, a cyber-security expert with the Chartered Institute for IT, said the Lloyds issues on Friday showed \"how fragile parts of the legacy banking system still are\". High street banks still rely on \"outdated infrastructure\" that may face extra strain in moments of high demand, such the month-end, he added. Professor Markos Zachariadis, chair of financial technology at the University of Manchester, told the BBC that if financial institutions cannot keep pace with demand or deal with technical issues, \"the economy will suffer many times at a high cost\". It may also add to pressures on consumer trust in traditional banks, says Shilpa Doreswamy of GFT Technologies.  \"It is becoming imperative for incumbent banks to urgently modernise their IT infrastructure or continue to face an accelerating loss of confidence - and maybe customers too,\" she told the BBC.

        "content": " Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Spanish Infanta so prized by the Tudors that, after her first husband the Prince of Wales died, she went on to marry his brother Henry VIII. Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Catherine of Aragon (1485-1536), the youngest child of the newly dominant Spanish rulers Ferdinand and Isabella. When she was 3, her parents contracted her to marry Arthur, Prince of Wales, the heir to the Tudor king Henry VII in order to strengthen Spain's alliances, since Henry's kingdom was a longstanding trade partner and an enemy of Spain's greatest enemy, France. For the next decade Catherine had the best humanist education available, preparing her for her expected life as queen and drawing inspiration from her warrior mother. She arrived in London to be married when she was 15 but within a few months she was widowed, her situation uncertain and left relatively impoverished for someone of her status. Rather than return home, Catherine stayed and married her late husband's brother, Henry VIII. In her view and that of many around her, she was an exemplary queen and, even after Henry VIII had arranged the annulment of their marriage for the chance of a male heir with Anne Boleyn, Catherine continued to consider herself his only queen.

        "title": "Heart and Soul: The mosque for Bangladesh’s transgender women",
        "content": " Sahar Zand visits a community in Bangladesh that is helping hijras - a group that includes intersex and transgender individuals - reclaim their right to Islam. In Bangladesh, hijras - once a revered community - have long lived on the margins. Also known as the third gender, hijras form a diverse group, including those born intersex - meaning their physical traits don’t fit neatly into ‘male’ or ‘female’ categories - and transgender individuals. Traditionally seen as spiritual figures with the power to bless or curse, they are now outcasts, denied homes, jobs, and opportunities. But in a quiet village in Mymensingh, a spiritual revolution is taking place. Reporter Sahar Zand has gained rare access to this community, spending time with its leader, Tanu - a transgender woman and practising Muslim - who has built a sanctuary where hijras can reconnect with faith. At the heart of this transformation is a Quran study group, offering hijras the religious education they were long denied, and a newly built mosque - the first in Bangladesh to welcome them as equals, after they were expelled from others.

        "title": "Trump to order dismantling of US education department",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: President Trump signs order to shut education department 'once and for all' US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives. Accusing the agency of \"breath-taking failures\", the Republican president vowed to return the money it controls to individual states. \"We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible,\" Trump said, although the White House acknowledged that closing the agency outright would require an act of Congress.  The move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week. Most US children attend public schools, which are free and run by local officials.  A common misconception is that the federal education department operates US schools and sets curriculum, but that is primarily done by states and local districts. A relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. Most of the money comes from state and local taxes.  Established in 1979, the department administers student loans and runs programmes to help low-income students. But Trump has accused it of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual, and political material. LISTEN: Rejecting public education in Arizona Surrounded by children seated at school desks in the White House on Thursday, Trump said \"the US spends more money on education by far than any other country\", yet he added that students rank near the bottom of the list.  The Unesco Institute for Statistics said the US spends roughly 5.4% of its GDP on education, which is higher than many countries but not all.  The department's budget last year was $238bn (Â£188bn), which is less than 2% of federal spending.  The White House stated that his administration would move to cut parts of the department that remain within legal boundaries. The executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government. At the signing ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.  He said he would find \"something else\" for her to do within the administration.  After Trump signed the order, Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy announced plans to bring legislation aimed at closing the department. But Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and closing a federal department would require 60 votes, making such a goal a longshot. A conservative pipe dream since Reagan  What Department of Education cuts mean for one mum What happens to student loans now? But even if the department is not formally closed, the Trump administration could decimate its funding and staff as it has done with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which subsequently stopped many of its programmes and humanitarian work.  The text of the executive order does not include specifics on what actions the administration will take and which programmes might be axed.  It orders McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure\" of the department and give authority of such matters to state and local governments. It also directs her to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".  This video can not be played White House: Students falling behind a 'national security issue' Soon after she was sworn in, McMahon sent the department's 4,400 employees a memo titled \"Our Department's Final Mission\", a possible reference to Trump's aim to close it.  \"This is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students,\" she wrote. \"I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\" Earlier reports suggested Trump would look to end some of the department's programmes and send others to different departments, such as the Treasury, something that still may happen but wasn't made clear in his executive order.  America's largest teachers' union recently decried Trump's plans, saying he \"doesn't care about opportunity for all kids\". In its statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: \"No-one likes bureaucracy, and everyone's in favour of more efficiency, so let's find ways to accomplish that.  \"But don't use a 'war on woke' to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.\" For more than 40 years, conservatives have complained about the department and floated ideas to abolish it.  Just two years after it was established by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, his Republican replacement, Ronald Reagan, led calls to undo it.  It is the smallest agency in the president's cabinet and takes up less than 2% of the total federal budget. Some of those staff have already been affected by the Trump administration's sweeping workforce cuts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). Nearly 2,100 people at the agency are set to be placed on leave from Friday. Efforts by Doge to slash federal spending and radically restructure - or simply abolish - many government agencies have been overseen by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

        "content": "Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will \"begin eliminating\"  the federal Department of Education (DoE)  Trump says that \"this is the right thing to do\", adding that the DoE will be shut \"as quickly as possible\" Most experts say that entirely scrapping the department would require an act of Congress The DoE is in charge of administering federal student loans for college and university students and offering assistance for low-income and disabled students  In the United States, schools are administered and paid for largely at the state level, especially for primary and secondary school - only about 13% of funding for those schools comes from federal sources The White House says that dismantling the department will improve student test scores and save money, but Democrats and other critics say the move would leave the most vulnerable students in the lurch This video can not be played President Trump signs order to shut education department 'once and for all' Edited by Caitlin Wilson Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from Washington Calls to dismantle - or abolish - the Department of Education stretch back long before Trump's return to the White House, all the way back to its inception.  On the campaign trail soon after the department was created, Ronald Reagan described the department as a \"new bureaucratic boondoggle\" that allowed Washington, rather than \"local needs and preferences\", to determine how American children were to be educated. For 43 years, his vision for the department - backed by members weary of \"big government\" federal control over state issues - went unrealised. Similar arguments were made by Republicans during subsequent administrations, although a lack of Congressional support made efforts to dismantle or eliminate the agency impossible. \"I do not believe we need a federal department of homework-checkers,\" then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich told the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in 1995. Many of the same arguments are being made today - with the added injection of ferocious national \"culture wars\" that Trump's team has highlighted both during the campaign and while back in the Oval Office.  Now, those Republican efforts seem to have come to fruition, with Trump's signing of an executive order to work towards close the department. Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Surrounded by more than a dozen young children and a smattering of\nRepublican governors in the East Room of the White House, Donald Trump used a\nstroke of his pen to set into motion his plans to shut down the entire\nfederal Department of Education on Thursday afternoon. Getting rid of the agency has been a\nlong-standing aim for Republicans, and many conservative voters will\nenthusiastically support this move. America does badly in many international\nleague tables in terms of educational outcomes, and Republicans blame the\ndepartment for that - despite the fact that individual states already control\nalmost 90% of the money that educates children in US schools.\nNevertheless, the president wants more power devolved away from Washington. Even before today's action,\nthe department had seen around half of its 4,000 staff let go - just a\nweek after Congress passed a funding bill including its budget. That money is\nmainly used to provide support for low-income and disabled children and to\nadminister college grants for those students who need financial support. Trump says those programmes will continue, but be administered by other\nagencies. However, like many other recent policy moves of the Trump administration, this one will also be\nchallenged in the courts. Already 20 attorneys general from Democratic\nstates have started the process of lodging objections, and the formal\ndismantling of the department itself would need an act of Congress - and in\nparticular 60 votes in the Senate, which Republicans do not currently have. Former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO Linda McMahon heads the education department in Trump's second administration.  A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. McMahon has a long history with the WWE and Trump, who used to make occasional appearances at wrestling matches. She co-founded Titan Sports with her husband in 1980, which then became the parent company of WWE later that decade. She resigned as CEO in 2009 in order to undertake a failed bid to run for the US Senate. McMahon has little background in education, but did serve on the Connecticut state board of education from 2009 until 2010. In October 2024, an attorney for McMahon said she \"will vigorously defend\" herself against accusations filed in a lawsuit that month which claimed she turned a blind eye to child sexual abuse by a former ringside announcer at WWE, according to the BBC's US partner CBS, external. The lawsuit has since been paused, CBS reports, external. McMahon is not accused of sexual abuse. Linda McMahon Education secretary Linda McMahon has just spoken to reporters at the White House, following the signing of President Donald Trump's executive order asking her to begin dismantling the Department of Education - the agency which she runs.  McMahon refutes accusations that the order hurts education in the US, saying that Trump's goal is to \"improve education\" and get dollars \"back to the states, without the bureaucracy of Washington.\" She was asked on what would happen to specific arms of the department, like those that deal with civil rights complaints within the education system.  In response, McMahon says that the executive order \"did not specify what happens with any of the departments within Education,\" and that she is looking at where some of those responsibilities would best be reallocated. She suggests that civil rights complaints, for example, could be overseen by the Department of Justice instead. Asked about the layoffs that have already taken place at the Department of Education, McMahon says the cuts were done \"thoughtfully\" and to avoid duplication within the agency.  She adds that those who were laid off will get three months of full pay and benefits, as well as severance packages that are \"much more generous\" than those seen in the private sector. A US parents group has slammed President Donald Trump's executive order to dismantle the Department of Education as \"shameful.\" In a statement, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, the head of advocacy group MomsRising, says \"there is nothing to celebrate about an order that guts the education system we rely on\".  \"Today's executive order will undermine the success of our students and the viability of our workforce, now and for years to come,\" she says. Rowe-Finkbeiner notes that 90% of students in the US attend public schools, and that dismantling the education department will lead to large class sizes, more schools without equipment or books, and end to tutoring programmes. She adds that these changes will specifically impact students with disabilities. \"Education is a pathway to opportunity and to a workforce, economy, and country that can thrive,\" she says. \"It is deeply disturbing and truly shameful that the Trump administration is destroying that.\" Mike WendlingReporting from Chicago Although todayâs executive order fulfils a long-standing\nTrump campaign pledge, its long-term effects are far from certain. To officially abolish the Department of Education - whose duties include overseeing federal loans and grants for college and university students - will\nrequire action by Congress.  Jill\nDesjean, director of policy analysis at the National Association of Student\nFinancial Aid Administrators, says there's not a huge amount of political\nappetite in Congress to get rid of the department. And even if it were to be\ndissolved, there are many questions about if and how the functions currently\ncarried out by the department would continue. \"There's nothing wrong with being more efficient and making things\nwork well for the taxpayer,\" Desjean\ntells the BBC. But she says that cuts to Department of Education staff - about\nhalf of employees - have happened with alarming speed. \"It's hard to believe that there was very much deliberate\nthought behind them,\" she says.  In the short term, Desjean says, students shouldnât be put off from applying to university or\napplying for financial aid because of the changes. But the large programmes\nthat the department administers will not be immediately transformed without problems\ncropping up, she says.  \"We want to see some careful thought as to how things would\nbe done to reduce disruption,\" she says.  Even before today's executive order, the Trump administration said last week it planned to cut the size of the education department in half. The mass layoffs will affect nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March. \"As part of the Department of Education's final mission, the department today initiated a reduction in force impacting nearly 50% of the department's workforce,\" McMahon said in a statement last week.  She said the cuts would impact all divisions in the department and were made to \"better serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers\". The agency had just over 4,000 employees when Trump was sworn into office, an announcement from the department states. It has the smallest staff of all the 15 US cabinet-level agencies. After the cuts, 2,183 people will remain, which included several hundred who retired or accepted a buyout programme earlier this year, the agency said. Kayla EpsteinUS reporter When Rebecca, a 48-year-old mother from Michigan, needed\nhelp for her disabled son, she turned to the US Department of Education's\nOffice of Civil Rights (OCR). Rebecca's 13-year-old adopted son had foetal alcohol\nsyndrome, ADHD, and other mental health diagnoses that required specialised\neducational support. She says the school district isolated him for months, with\nonly special education teachers and limited faculty for contact. In October 2024, she filed a complaint with the OCR alleging the school violated federal disability law and only allowed him to \"attend school for two hours per school day and\nin a 1:1 segregated setting\".  Hours were gradually added back to her son's school day, Rebecca said, but he\nremained isolated. Rebecca had a private lawyer and an education advocate, but an\nOCR lawyer was facilitating a mediation with the school district as soon as\nApril. But before that could happen, the Trump administration fired\nthe Cleveland office's entire staff, including the attorney helping Rebecca's son,\nthrowing her case - and others like it - into limbo. \"I\ndon't have any other option for this kid,\" says Rebecca, who asked the BBC\nto withhold her last name and her son's name to protect his privacy.\n\"They're playing politics with my little boy. And I don't think that's\nfair.\" Meanwhile, Rebecca has transferred her son to a district school for students with emotional impairments. But she still wants the OCR to negotiate special tutoring for her son, and to educate the district staff about how to help students like him.  She recently learned her son's case would transfer to the still-operating Denver office, but has received no other updates. Less than an hour after Donald Trump signed the executive\norder that will âbegin eliminatingâ the Department of Education, weâre already\nhearing of plans to codify the document. South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds, who introduced legislation in November\nto abolish the DoE, says heâs already in talks with Education Secretary Linda\nMcMahon to seal the fate of the department. \"I am working on legislation that would return education\ndecisions to states and local school districts while maintaining important\nprograms like special education and Title I,\" Rounds writes on X. \"We are discussing this legislation with Secretary McMahon\nand we believe there is a very good path forward.\" Kayla EpsteinNational digital reporter Trump's executive order, which would only come into force\nwith the approval of Congress and will likely face many legal challenges, has\nthe potential to reshape how children are educated across the country. Although the department has little oversight over the day to\nday operations of most schools in the US, it plays a key role in enforcing\nfederal education guidelines and policies. The Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which enforces US civil rights\nlaws at the education level, was one of the hardest-hit divisions in that first\nround of firings.  The administration\nshuttered seven of the 12 regional offices, including in major metropolitan\nareas like New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco.  This month the entire staff at OCR's Cleveland office\nreceived an email that their unit was \"being abolished\" â along with\ntheir positions. The news left one Cleveland attorney who worked on\ndisability cases with a \"complete feeling of desperation.\" The attorney worried not only about the individual cases\nstill underway, they told the BBC. \"The effect of each individual case is sometimes much\nbigger, in terms of educating the school and making good for the others in the\ndistrict,\" said the attorney, who requested anonymity because they feared\nretaliation from the administration. \"We were already so incredibly flooded with\ncases,\" the Cleveland attorney said. \"I was never proud of our\nprocessing time.\" With the new cuts, they said, \"This work will not be\nable to be done.\" During her Senate confirmation hearing last month, US President Donald Trump's pick for Education Secretary Linda McMahon confirmed any decision to dismantle the education department would need approval from Congress first. \"We work with Congress, it clearly cannot be shut down without it,\" McMahon told lawmakers. This video can not be played Department of Education 'cannot' be shutdown without Congress - Linda McMahon The department's allocation was $238bn (Â£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget. The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments. In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil. School choice advocates have been celebrating Trumpâs executive\norder. They believe it is the first step for more freedom for students\nand parents to move schools, backed by public money. Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children â a\npro-school choice advocacy group â said American education had been centralised\nâin one of our countryâs greatest failed public policies.â The signing was attended by Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms\nfor Liberty, a conservative âanti-wokeâ group that has also been heavily in\nfavour of expanding school choice. In a statement, Justice said: \"The promise to dismantle the\nDepartment of Education is not a new one, however President Trump is the first\nto follow through... I am proud to stand behind the president to undertake this\neffort and return education to the states and ultimately give the power back to\nthe parents.â Mike WendlingUS reporter When it comes to school choice, US students have a dizzying\narray of, well, choices. Traditionally there have been two main options: state-funded\npublic schools and private schools, often religiously affiliated. But in the 1980s and 1990s, amid fear of declining standards and\nfailing schools, a growing movement clamoured for more possibilities. Some districts set up charter or magnet schools. These often\noperate somewhat separately from the public school system. Some focus on one subject\narea or are selective â pupils take an entry test or must meet other criteria. Other initiatives include voucher systems â allowing students to\ntake the public money that would normally be used to educate them in a public\nschool to attend school in a different district or even pay for a religiously\naffiliated private school. In some states, students can enrol in schools outside their\nlocal areas, and thereâs also the growing popularity of homeschooling â where\nparents and students opt out of the system altogether. School choice is generally more popular among Republicans, which\nexplains the Trump administrations moves to increase it. But itâs a contentious\nissue and one that does not break down neatly along partisan lines. Some of the\nplaces where parents and students most exercise their ability to choose are\nbig, left-wing Democrat-run cities. An official copy of the executive order President Donald Trump\nsigned earlier has just been released. Its title is âImproving education outcomes by empowering\nparents, states, and communities.â Here is a breakdown of what it says:  The order does not give\na timeline for when this would need to take place, and does not go into detail\non what steps Education Secretary Linda McMahon should take to begin the\ndismantling of the Education Department. Lisa LambertReporting from Washington DC Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on\nEducation, has been warning for weeks that Trump's funding cuts to research,\nalong with the staff reductions in the department, would hurt higher education\nin the US. \"This is political theatre, not serious public policy,â he\nsaid after todayâs executive order was signed. âTo dismantle any cabinet-level\nfederal agency requires congressional approval, and we urge lawmakers to reject\nmisleading rhetoric in favour of what is in the best interests of students and\ntheir families.â Mitchell continued saying that significant harm had already been\ndone to students and taxpayers by the Trump administrationâs âarbitrary and\nmisguided steps to hollow out the department.\" He added that one itâs many \"critical functions\" is\n\"ensuring that student financial aid programs provide millions of low- and\nmiddle-income students access to postsecondary education.\" The department runs a massive program to provide low-interest\nloans and grants to help students afford university - both for undergraduate\nand graduate education. The aid program is expected to continue to exist, but\nmany university students are now wondering in what form, and if this means they\nmay receive less assistance in the future. Ana Faguy On his own, no. Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of\nthe department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US\nSenate - 60 out of 100 senators. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would\nneed at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political\nlongshot. Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to\ngain necessary support. A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was\nattached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans\njoined all Democrats in the House to vote no. Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent\nweeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves. The Department of Education has just released a statement\nfollowing President Trump's signing of today's executive order. It calls the order a \"history-making action\" that will\n\"free future generations of American students and forge opportunities for\ntheir success.\" The statement also repeats Trump's claim that dismantling the department\nwill send education \"back to the states where it so rightly belongs.\" As we reported earlier, a common misconception is that the\ndepartment operates US schools and sets curricula - but that is done by states\nand local districts. And a relatively small percentage of funding for primary\nand secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. The statement notes that \"closing the department does not\nmean cutting off funds from those who depend on them,\" vowing to continue\nsupporting students with special needs, college students and others. \"Weâre going to follow the law and eliminate the\nbureaucracy responsibly by working with Congress and state leaders to ensure a\nlawful and orderly transition,\" the department says. US President Donald\nTrump has just signed an executive order to shut down the Department of\nEducation - here is a recap of what's just happened: Trump has just signed the executive order to begin dismantling the Department of Education.

        "content": "The school is one of several elite institutions that have tried to expand financial aid as the cost of college soars Harvard University has announced that it is making tuition free for families who earn less than $200,000 (Â£154,000) a year. For families earning less than $100,000, Harvard will also cover expenses like housing and health insurance. The move is aimed at making Harvard more affordable for middle-income families, and it comes as the Trump administration targets university funding as a part of a crackdown on diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. \"Putting Harvard within financial reach for more individuals widens the array of backgrounds, experiences,Â andÂ perspectives that all of our students encounter, fostering their intellectual andÂ personal growth,\" said Harvard President Alan Garber. The policy - which will begin in the 2025 to 2026 academic year - will help \"make a Harvard College education possible for every admitted student\", Garber added.  The Ivy League school said the move will allow roughly 86% of US families to qualify for Harvard's financial aid. The median household income in the US was $80,000 in 2023, according to the US Census.  In the US, DEI is under attack. But under a different name, it might live on A number of elite universities in the US have taken similar steps in recent years, including the University of Pennsylvania and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which also have free tuition for families making less than $200,000.  Harvard had previously made all university costs, including housing and medical care, free for families with incomes under $85,000.  The average price of a private university in the US for those living on campus is $58,000 per academic year, according to the Education Data Initiative. The average cost of college has more than doubled since 2001, the research group found.  The financial aid expansions come as the Trump administration has threatened to pull funding from universities over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, research and coursework that they allege is a form of racial discrimination.  Under Trump, the Department of Education has said it is investigating 52 universities across the country for alleged \"racial preferences and stereotypes in education programs and activities\" as Trump attempts to get rid of DEI programmes.  The Trump administration has already pulled $400m in grants and contracts from Columbia University, alleging the Ivy League school failed to prevent antisemitism on campus as protests grew over Israel's war in Gaza.  Last year, the US Supreme Court voted to overturn affirmative action. The practice favoured individuals in disadvantaged groups to help eliminate discrimination against marginalised applicants during the enrollment process and increase diversity among students.

        "title": "Protesters in Turkey rally 'for justice' after mayor's arrest",
        "content": "Imamoglu was detained as he was about to register to run against President Erdogan The main rival to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption. Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, was due to be selected as the Republican People's Party's (CHP) 2028 presidential nominee in a vote on Sunday.  He has denied the allegations and said they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody. His detention sparked some of Turkey's largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\". Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday, triggering five consecutive nights of demonstrations. On Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\". He was remanded in custody pending trial. AFP and local media reported he had been taken to a prison in Silivri. Imamoglu has also been suspended from his post as mayor, Turkey's interior ministry said in a statement. This video can not be played Watch: Police uses pepper spray on protesters in Turkey on Sunday In social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\", and said judicial procedure was not being followed. He urged people across the country to join protests and take part in Sunday's vote. In a message shared on X through his lawyers late on Sunday, Imamoglu sent his greetings to those protesting and said that voters had showed Turkey had \"enough\" of Erdogan. Protests continued for a fifth night on Sunday, despite a ban on gatherings. Crowds had amassed near Istanbul's city hall by early evening, and could be seen waving Turkish flags and chanting in front of a row of riot police. Officers were seen firing water cannons at some protesters and using pepper spray. Riot police clashed with protestors after dark Imamoglu was the only person running in the CHP's presidential candidate selection.  The arrest does not prevent Imamoglu's candidacy and election as president, but if he is convicted of any of the charges against him, he will not be able to run.   Imamoglu's CHP party said nearly 15 million people cast a ballot on Sunday. The CHP said some 1.6 million votes came from its members, while the rest were cast by non-members at separate ballot boxes for those who wished to show solidarity with Imamoglu. The BBC cannot independently verify these figures. The jailed politician is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president. However, due to term limits, Erdogan cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution. Opposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated.  But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those connecting Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence. On Sunday, X's Global Government Affairs department said it objected to \"multiple court orders\" from Turkey's communications regulator to block over 700 accounts on the platform, including those of Turkish political figures and journalists. X said the move was \"not only unlawful, it hinders millions of Turkish users from news and political discourse in their country\". Millions of people voted for Imamoglu in \"solidarity\" ballot boxes set up for non-party members, CHP said Meanwhile, Istanbul University announced on Tuesday it was revoking Imamoglu's degree due to alleged irregularities. If upheld, this would put his ability to run as president into doubt, since the Turkish constitution says presidents must have completed higher education to hold office. Imamoglu's lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate. Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu? Protests erupt in Turkey after Erdogan rival arrested Prosecutors also want to charge Imamoglu with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was not currently necessary. The CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year's local elections.  DEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - which it denies.  The PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US. More than 300 people were arrested during Saturday night's protests Thousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations since Imamoglu's detention on Wednesday. More than 700 arrests have been made since the protests began, according to Turkish authorities. On Saturday, one young woman outside the mayor's office, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy. \"I'm here for justice, I'm here for liberty. We're free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\" Another woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she was worried about his future. \"It's getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can't control our lives, we can't choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.

        "title": "Namibia's Sam Nujoma: 'End of era' for Africa as country buries founding father",
        "content": "Namibians gathered on Friday and Saturday to pay their respects to Sam Nujoma Namibia's founding father Sam Nujoma was \"a giant among leaders\" and left behind \"the most precious gift ofâ¦ freedom\", the country's President, Nangolo Mbumba, has said. He was speaking in front of the large crowd at Heroes' Acre, where the country's most revered citizens are buried, before Nujoma was laid to rest in a mausoleum. The leader of Namibia's independence struggle against apartheid South Africa died last month at the age of 95. Nujoma was seen as the last of a generation of African figures who headed anti-colonial movements and fought for freedom. \"Therefore his departure signals an end of an era, a founding father of Africa,\" President Mbumba said in an earlier speech at a national memorial service on Friday. \"We are not only mourning today, we are celebrating an extraordinary leader who has contributed significantly to our country's independence, who will continue to inspire us for many more years to come,\" Namibian Given Shiyukifein told the Reuters news agency. The revolutionary leader who liberated Namibia On Saturday, Nujoma's coffin, draped in the Namibian flag, was driven by a military gun carriage from the centre of the capital, Windhoek, where the body was lying in state, to the burial ground on the outskirts of the city. Mourners had been arriving since the early hours, the independent Namibian newspaper reported. It added that they waved flags and sang songs in his memory, including Sam Ouli Peni? (Sam, Where are you?) â a popular anthem from the period after independence in 1990. Sam Nujoma steered Namibia to independence and led the country until 2005 Among the dignitaries present were the presidents of neighbouring countries Angola, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Nujoma, one of 10 children from a peasant family, was working on the railway in the late 1940s when he got a political education. He developed a passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism. He led the long fight for freedom from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, and helped found the liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s. As the country's first president â a position he held for 15 years until 2005 - Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability. His policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy. He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. Namibia, then known as South West Africa, was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One. It then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms. The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966.

        "title": "Keir Starmer says benefit system unfair and indefensible",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer has called the current benefits system unsustainable, indefensible and unfair, and said the government could not \"shrug its shoulders and look away\".  Addressing Labour MPs on Monday evening, the prime minister said the current welfare system was \"the worst of all worlds\", discouraging people from working while producing a \"spiralling bill\".  The comments come as Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall prepares to set out changes to the welfare system and cut the benefits bill in the coming weeks. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. Changes likely to be announced in the coming days include restrictions on eligibility for the Personal Independent Payment, which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit.  There is unease over the plans within the party, with Labour MP Rachael Maskell warning against \"draconian cuts\" that risk \"pushing disabled people into poverty\". Maskell told the BBC she had picked up \"deep, deep concern\" among Labour MPs. She said: \"I look in the past at what Labour has achieved in this space and believe that we can hold on to our values, ensure that we're helping people and not harming people.\" Another Labour MP, Neil Duncan-Jordan, also expressed concern, telling Newsnight: \"If we are going to make poor people poorer then there will be a number of MPs who won't be able to sign up to that. \"It feels like it could be a re-run of austerity and I'm worried about that.\" How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall? Some on benefits are 'taking the mickey', says minister Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments However, other sections of the Parliamentary Labour Party are calling for change.  The Get Britain Working group of 36 Labour MPs has said the government has a \"moral duty\" to help long-term sick and disabled people to work if they can. In a letter to Kendall, the MPs said the country faced \"hard choices\" to overcome a \"crisis of economic inactivity\". Speaking at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Sir Keir said: \"We've found ourselves in a worst of all worlds situation - with the wrong incentives - discouraging people from working, the taxpayer funding a spiralling bill. \"A wasted generation, one-in-eight young people not in education, employment or training, and the people who really need that safety net still not always getting the dignity they deserve. \"That's unsustainable, it's indefensible and it is unfair, people feel that in their bones. \"So, this needs to be our offer to people up and down the country: If you can work, we will make work pay - if you need help, that safety net will be there for you.  \"But this is the Labour Party - we believe in the dignity of work and we believe in the dignity of every worker.\" A number of MPs leaving the meeting said they had been satisfied with the prime minister's words.  One said they accepted that welfare reform had to happen and were reassured that he had said it had to be done with Labour values and through the dignity of work. However, another said constituents were frightened and needed to know that support would be there. They said there had been little recognition that reducing benefits like the Personal Independence Payment, which helps people keep their independence, had the potential to push up costs. Labour MP Diane Abbott said she would have liked to query the impact of the prime minister's proposed cuts to welfare but was told the meeting was full.  In a letter to Reeves, a dozen charities have argued there is \"little evidence to suggest cutting benefits increases employment outcomes\". The charities - including Disability Rights UK, Citizens Advice, Scope and Sense - urged her to \"think again about cuts to disability benefits\". They said: \"There are disabled people out of work who want to work given the right support. And for some disabled people, work isn't appropriate. \"Changes to welfare must start here. Not with cuts.\" But ministers are worried about the surge in the number of people claiming benefits since the Covid-19 pandemic and the cost to the taxpayer. As of January, 9.3 million people aged 16 to 64 in the UK were economically inactive - a rise of 713,000 since the pandemic. The Department of Work and Pensions says some 2.8 million people are economically inactive because of long-term sickness. Last year, the government spent Â£65bn on sickness benefits and that figure is forecast to increase by tens of billions before the next general election. Some of the reforms to the welfare system have already been announced and include plans to use 1,000 work coaches to help the long-term unemployed into work. Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Share your experiences. Conservative shadow businesses secretary Andrew Griffith said Sir Keir had \"rightly\" talked about the problem of millions of working-age people on welfare. \"That is a stain on our country's character,\" Griffith told the BBC. \"But it also holds back the economy and it's one of the reasons why we're not growing.\" However, Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling said \"slashing support without fixing broken public services is not the answer\". \"We need long-term reform and investment in health and social care, not short-term cuts that balance the nation's finances on the backs of the most vulnerable,\" he said.

        "content": "Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is Namibia's first female president  Namibia's new president was sworn in on Friday to lead a country facing high rates of unemployment, inequality and poverty.  And she will be dealing with it with the additional burden of being only Africa's second-ever directly elected female president and Namibia's first female head of state.  \"If things go well then it will be seen as a good example,\" Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah told BBC's Africa Daily podcast. \"But if anything then happens, like it can happen in any administration under men, there are also those who would rather say: 'Look at women!'\"  The 72-year-old won November's election with a 58% share of the vote. Nandi-Ndaitwah has been a long-term loyalist of the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) â which has been in power since the country gained independence in 1990 after a long struggle against apartheid South Africa. She joined Swapo, then a liberation movement resisting South Africa's white-minority rule, when she was only 14. While the party has made changes and improved the lives of the black majority, the legacy of apartheid can still be seen in patterns of wealth and land ownership.  \"Truly, land is a serious problem in this country,\" she told the BBC ahead of the inauguration.  \"We still have some white citizens and more particularly the absent land owners who are occupying the land.\" From freedom fighter to Namibia's first female president LISTEN: Africa Daily's interview with Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah She adds that she is committed to the \"willing-buyer, willing-seller\" principle, which means no-one is forced to sell up.  Namibia is a geographically large country with a small population of three million.  Government statistics show that white farmers own about 70% of the country's farmland. A total of  53,773 Namibians identified as white in the 2023 census, external, representing 1.8% of the country's population.  Namibia is one of the world's most unequal countries, with a Gini coefficient of 59.1 in 2015, according to the World Bank, external, which projects poverty is expected to remain high at 17.2% in 2024.  The unemployment rate rose to 36.9% in 2023 from 33.4% in 2018, according to the country's statistics agency., external Nandi-Ndaitwah said the economy, which partly relies on mineral exports, should work more on adding value to what the country extracts from the ground rather than exporting raw materials. She also wants Namibia to focus more on creative industries and get the education sector to adjust to new economic realities. Nandi-Ndaitwah is only the second African woman to be directly elected as president, after Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. The continent's only other female president at the moment is Tanzania's Samia Suluhu Hassan, who took up the role after her predecessor died in office in 2021.

        "title": "Doctors back total ban on smacking children in England",
        "content": "Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing. Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\". Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament. The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life. Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\" If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England. Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK. In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the \"reasonable punishment\" defence still stands. In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860. Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022. Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so. The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage. A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the \"single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation\".  \"This government has prioritised significant reform of the children's social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,\" they added. Parents at a baby sensory group in Sale, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they were all against smacking children, but some were unsure about whether it was right for the government to intervene. Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\" Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\". Oli Harrison, pictured with his daughter Lily, said \"some kind of legislation\" would help provide clarity for parents When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\". He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children's wellbeing. Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif. Sara was murdered in August 2023 after a \"campaign of torture\" by her father and stepmother which lasted for two years. Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death. It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault. He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to \"draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal\". Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment. Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with \"depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour\". She said a legal change was needed \"urgently\", adding that \"right now we know physical punishment remains a part of childhood for too many young people in England\". Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors' calls. He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean \"a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand\" faces criminal prosecution. Lynn Perry, chief executive of the Barnardo's children's charity, said: \"No violence against children is acceptable. And yet children continue to face less legal protection against physical assault than adults.\" Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes and Hayley Clarke Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

        "title": "Mental health conditions are overdiagnosed, Streeting says",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Streeting says 'wait for plans' amid PIP cuts row There is an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\", Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said. Streeting told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the welfare system had to be \"sustainable\", as he defended the government's forthcoming  reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill. Mental health charity Mind has since warned it was important to be \"extremely careful\" with the language around diagnoses to avoid stigmatising people. More than half of the rise in working-age disability claims since the Covid pandemic is related to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, external. The eligibility of people to apply for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - the main benefit for working-age adults - looks likely to be tightened under the plans. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out details of reforms to welfare on Tuesday. When asked if he agreed with experts that warn of an overdiagnosis of mental health conditions, Streeting said he wanted to \"follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis\". He told the BBC: \"Here's the other thing, mental wellbeing, illness, it's a spectrum and I think definitely there's an overdiagnosis but there's too many people being written off.\" The health secretary said there were \"too many people who just aren't getting the support they need\" and highlighted the government's pledge to recruit 8,500 more mental health staff to cut waiting lists. Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and campaigns for Mind, said Streeting was right to say not enough people were getting the right help, but warned against stigmatising those with mental health problems. He said: \"Applying for benefits is not an easy process. People with a mental health problem must go through a lengthy and arduous assessment process, with decisions to not award support often overturned at appeal stage\". Mr Patel acknowledged more must be done to equip people to look after their mental health, but added \"we must remember we have experienced a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and cost-of-living crisis.  \"We have deep problems of poverty, low-paid and insecure work and systemic racism in this country,\" he added, saying mental health services are at \"breaking point\". Also responding to Streeting's comments, Brian Dow, deputy chief executive of charity Rethink Mental Illness, said pressures in the system created a \"tremendous struggle\" for people with long-term illnesses to get diagnosed. \"The crisis in the nation's mental health is very real,\" Mr Dow said. Does cutting benefits actually work? The previous Conservative government had explored, external making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP. Streeting would not be drawn on the details of the government's welfare reforms. The BBC understands ministers are considering abandoning plans to not increase PIPs in line with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - for a year. The potential shift in position comes after a number of usually loyal Labour MPs voiced strong opposition to freezing PIP. When asked if PIPs would be frozen, Streeting said: \"I haven't seen the full plans, they haven't come to Cabinet yet. \"But what I do know is the Work and Pensions Secretary wants to support people who need help the most.\" He added: \"I haven't seen the proposals but you've seen the briefing, you've seen the speculation. I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.\" Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform. When asked if the Conservatives would back the welfare changes, she said her party supported the \"principle of welfare reform\" but \"we're not clear on the plan\". The SNP has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the \"cuts to disabled people\". The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the Labour government had \"boxed itself in with its Tory austerity rules\" on public spending. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billions of pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. On Friday, she said ministers needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, as she attempts to meet the government's self-imposed rules on public spending. Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from Â£64.7bn in 2023-24 to Â£100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. PIP is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending on this projected to almost double to Â£34bn by 2029-30. PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work. Part of the reforms set out by Kendall will include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.

        "title": "Scotland's former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to step down as MSP at 2026 Holyrood election",
        "content": "This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says serving as an MSP has been \"an incredible chapter of my life\" Scotland's former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to stand down as an MSP, she has announced. The ex-SNP leader confirmed she would not seek re-election at the Holyrood election in May next year.  After announcing her decision on social media, she told BBC Scotland News her time in parliament had been a \"privilege beyond words\".  She added: \"But the time is right for me at this stage in my life to close the book on that chapter and open a new one.\" Who is Nicola Sturgeon, former SNP leader and Scottish first minister? Nicola Sturgeon says time is right to resign as FM Sturgeon: Winner who fell short of ultimate prize Sturgeon resigned as first minister in March 2023 after eight years in the role.  She is Scotland's longest-serving first minister and the first woman to hold the position. Her resignation as party leader marked the beginning of a tumultuous period for her and the SNP. In June 2023 she was arrested and released without charge as part of a police investigation into SNP finances. She insists she has done nothing wrong. Her husband Peter Murrell, who had long served as the SNP's chief executive, has since been charged with embezzling SNP funds. In January, Sturgeon announced that the pair had decided to end their marriage. The Glasgow Southside MSP is one of the original MSPs elected in 1999. Nicola Sturgeon announced she was separating from her husband Peter Murrell in January Announcing her decision to step down, Sturgeon highlighted policies introduced during her time in office such as the Scottish Child Payment and expanded early years education. She also said she remained committed to the campaign for Scottish independence.  The former first minister has faced criticism for her record on tackling drugs deaths, closing the attainment gap between school pupils from better off and more deprived backgrounds, and on controversial gender recognition reforms that would have made it easier for transgender people to change their legally recognised sex. Sturgeon told BBC Scotland News she was \"proud\" of her achievements and would \"leave it to others\" to criticise her legacy. On gender recognition reforms, she added: \"I will never apologise for trying to make life better for one of the most stigmatised, discriminated against sections of our society.\" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon delivers speech as she resigns as first minister Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond as SNP leader and first minister in 2014. The long-time friends remained close allies until their fallout over her government's mishandling of harassment complaints against him. Salmond died aged 69 while attending a conference in North Macedonia in October 2024. Sturgeon did not attend his funeral or memorial service. She led the SNP to a series of election victories at UK, Scottish and local level. This included a historic landslide in the 2015 general election, where the party won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. In 2022, the UK Supreme Court ruled that Holyrood did not have the power to stage another independence referendum - a move blocked by the UK government. Sturgeon with the 56 SNP MPs who won seats in 2015 Sturgeon was succeeded by Humza Yousaf as first minister.  He lasted just a year in the role, stepping down last April after a decision to rip up a power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens left him facing a vote of no confidence. Yousaf announced in December last year that he is to stand down as an MSP at the 2026 Holyrood election. Following Sturgeon's latest announcement, Yousaf posted on X, external: \"I am excited to see what Nicola goes on to do next. \"She is one of the most talented politicians of our generation. I am personally grateful for her advice, trust, and friendship over the years. With every good wish Nicola Sturgeon.\" Nicola Sturgeon was succeeded by Humza Yousaf and John Swinney as first minister  Yousaf was replaced as first minister by Sturgeon's deputy John Swinney, who after a poor showing at July's general election has seen support for SNP stabilise in the polls.  Swinney said he was \"very sorry\" that Sturgeon was stepping down and thanked her for her \"extraordinary contribution\" to Scottish politics. He added that the former first minister had \"many different policy achievements to be proud of in changing the lives of people in Scotland for the better\".  Sturgeon told BBC Scotland News in December that she was focussed on her constituents after being criticised for speaking just four times in the parliament last year. She has made four contributions in the chamber so far this year, though three were to tell the presiding officer she had a problem with her voting app. Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton said her party wished any departing MSP well \"but we cannot forget the deep divisions in our country that Nicola Sturgeon created, fostered and encouraged\". She added: \"By any objective analysis, her record as first minister is one of failure. Scottish education standards collapsed on her watch and the poverty-related attainment gap, which she promised to eradicate, widened.\" Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said Sturgeon's announcement marked \"the end of an era in Scottish politics\". \"Whilst I have many disagreements with her, I never doubted her passion for Glasgow and Scotland. I wish her well for the future,\" he added. Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater, who served as a minister in Sturgeon's SNP-Green government, described the former first minister as a \"legend\". \"Scottish politics has been better with her in charge â her careful planning, her good communication and her sense that she really cares about people.\" Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: \"The SNP have been in power for too long, and the departure of another big figure is further proof of their decline.\" Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell to end marriage Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "title": "South Africa's anti-apartheid activists haunted by their persecution as compensation anger brews",
        "content": "Many young people sacrificed their lives to fight the racist system of apartheid It was late at night on 10 December 1987 when prison officers had woken Mzolisi Dyasi in his cell in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. He remembers the bumpy drive to a hospital morgue where he was asked to identify the bodies of his pregnant girlfriend, his cousin and a fellow anti-apartheid fighter. In response, he had dropped to one knee, raised his fist in the air, and attempted to shout \"amandla!\" (\"power\" in Zulu), in an act of defiance.  But the word caught in his throat as he was \"totally broken\", Mr Dyasi tells the BBC, recalling the sight of his loved ones under the cold, bright lights. Four decades on, Mr Dyasi sleeps with the lights on to ward off memories of the physical and mental torture he suffered during his four years in prison. He says that he struggled to build a life for himself in the society he fought for as an underground operative for uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the-then banned African National Congress (ANC). The ANC led the struggle against the racist system of apartheid, which ended in 1994 with the party's rise to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election.  A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was co-chaired by the internationally renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was established to uncover the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime, and a state reparations fund was set up to assist some of the victims.  But much of that money has largely gone unspent. Mr Dyasi was among about 17,000 people who received a one-off payment of  30,000 rand ($3,900; Â£2,400 at the time) from it in 2003, but he says that has done very little to help him. He had wanted to complete his university education but has still not paid for courses he took in 1997.  Now in his 60s, he suffers from chronic health issues and finds it difficult to afford medication on the special pension he receives for veterans who participated in the struggle for freedom and democracy. Mzolisi Dyasi (C), pictured here on his way to the funeral of a political activist in 1993, feels let down after the sacrifices he made Professor Tshepo Madlingozi - a member of South Africa's Human Rights Commission who spoke to the BBC in his personal capacity - says the effects of apartheid continue to be devastating.  \"It was not only about the killing of people, the disappearance of people, it was about locking people into intergenerational impoverishment.\" He says that despite the progress made over the past 30 years, many of the \"born-free generation\" - South Africans born after 1994 - have inherited the cycle. The reparations fund has about $110m untouched, with no clarity on why this is the case.  \"What is the money being used for? Is the money still there?\" Prof Madlingozi commented.  The government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.  Lawyer Howard Varney has spent much of his career representing victims of apartheid-era crimes and says that the story of reparations in South Africa is one of \"deep betrayal\" for the families affected. He is currently representing a group of victims' families and survivors who are suing the South African government for $9m over what they say is its failure to adequately handle cases of political crimes that were highlighted by the now-disbanded TRC for further investigations and prosecutions.  Brian Mphahlele was polite and soft-spoken; he would pause before responding to a question, as if waiting for his thoughts to pool in his mind. He suffered from memory loss, just one aspect of the lasting impact of the physical and psychological torture he had undergone at Cape Town's notorious Pollsmoor Prison. Mr Mphahlele told the BBC that the 30,000 rand pay-out, which he had received for the violations he endured during his 10 years in prison, was an insult. \"It went through my fingers. It went through everybody's fingers, it was so little,\" the 68-year-old said on the phone last year from his nephew's home in Langa township in Cape Town, where he lived.  He felt that a more substantial payment would have enabled him to buy his own home and described his frustration at his life in Langa, where he ate at a soup kitchen three times a week.  Since he spoke to the BBC, Mr Mphahlele has died, his hope of a more comfortable life unfulfilled. Prof Madlingozi says that South Africa became the \"poster child\" of racial reconciliation following the end of apartheid, and inspired the world in many ways. \"But we have also unintentionally given a wrong message, which is that a crime against humanity can be committed without consequence,\" he says. Though he feels things can still be turned around. \"South Africa has an opportunity 30 years into democracy to show that you can make mistakes and fix those mistakes.\" Mr Dyasi still remembers the sense of freedom and optimism he felt when he left prison in 1990 after South Africa's last white ruler FW de Klerk unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, paving the way for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela to become the first black president four years later.  But Mr Dyasi says he does not feel proud of who he is today, and his disappointment is felt by many who fought alongside him and their families.  \"We don't want to be millionaires,\" he says. \"But if the government could just look at the healthcare of these people, if it could look after their livelihood, involve them in the economic system of the country.\" \"There were children that were orphaned by the struggle. Some children wanted to go to school but they still can't. Some people are homeless.  \"And some people would say, 'You were in prison, you were shot at. But what is it that you can show for it?'\" Athol Fugard: Death of a great South African playwright How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdom Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?

        "title": "William sees how text messages can save young lives",
        "content": "A support service that lets young people text for help when they're in an emergency mental health crisis has now had three million conversations, with 2,000 messages arriving each day. The Prince of Wales visited the project in west London which provides 24/7 free text message support for young people with problems, including suicidal thoughts, but who would be unlikely to pick up a phone to talk. The Shout service responds to emergency messages seeking help, which might come in emojis and text speak, and often late at night. Among the volunteers staffing this service, designed to be accessible for a digital generation, is Ben West, whose brother Sam took his own life in 2018. Ben West says he wishes the text service had been available for his brother \"How amazing is it, from my point of view, after what Sam went through and losing Sam, to be able to sit there and tell someone texting they're not on their own any more,\" said Ben. \"We're going to come up with a plan together, and we can spend some time chatting and we can get you to a place where you're more in control. \"I've had conversations where people have told me something they've never told anybody else before in their lives. It's a privilege to be on the other end of that,\" said Ben, one of 2,000 current volunteers responding to texts to \"Shout 85258\". Prince William met Ben and other young advisers to the project, hearing about helping young people who might have been reluctant to try other mental health services.  \"Young people much prefer to talk via text, it's become their language anyway... they find it much more accessible and much less intimidating to text someone than speak on the phone,\" said Ben. Ben West shows a training system for volunteers to Prince William The Shout helpline was launched in 2018 by Mental Health Innovations, a charity set up by the Royal Foundation, reflecting the prince's longstanding interest in mental health, having helped set up the Heads Together project. Prince William was himself a volunteer on the text helpline, after receiving training, during the Covid pandemic, saying his first shift was \"terrifying\". \"Some of those conversations lived with me for quite a long time afterwards, and you always say to yourself, 'Did I give enough, did I do enough, did I find the right answer?'\" said Prince William. \"It's more than just a text line, it's life saving,\" said the prince. He was told that on 35,000 occasions emergency services had intervened directly when people getting in touch seemed to be in imminent danger. The text message helpline makes it easier for those already struggling to share their feelings. \"Sam, my brother, was really embarrassed about his diagnosis of depression, for him it felt like a flaw and something to hide,\" said Ben, who since his brother's suicide has campaigned to improve mental health services. There are other at-risk groups who can also use the service, who might otherwise be reluctant to speak about their feelings, including middle-aged men. Victoria Hornby said that younger age groups were increasingly in need of help Victoria Hornby, chief executive of Mental Health Innovations, said there has been an increase in the \"severity\" of the problems faced by those seeking help, since the scheme was first launched in 2018. The percentage of messages from people with suicidal thoughts has risen from 25% to 37%, she said, Among the other reasons for getting in touch was about low mood, stress, relationship problems, self-harming, loneliness and issues such as body image or tensions about sexuality. There has also been a significant increase in calls for help from a younger age group, those aged 13 and under, which she said seemed to be part of a growing sense of anxiety and pressure on children's lives. Sunday night is the single busiest time for calls, she said, reflecting the pressures people feel before going into the new week, whether at school, college or work. It's a moment when a text message exchange, away from other people, can be the way to get help, she said: \"You can't be overheard. For some people having to say out loud things that are incredibly difficult, that can stop people from reaching for help.\" The text helpline is merging with another support service aimed at young people, the Mix, and there is an aim for a wider range of support services, including peer-to-peer mentoring and counselling. Prince William spoke of the importance of support after that initial contact and education services to help people before their problems are too overwhelming. \"Prevention is really important, before things go spiralling down,\" he said. A report into the project by Imperial College London said such digital services could help tackle the waiting times for help with mental health problems, with 1.5 million waiting for treatment, including 100,000 children and young people. The report said that two thirds of those who had got in touch with Shout had felt calmer from the exchange.  \"We've saved lives. It's an amazing feeling. I just wish this service existed when Sam needed it, someone like me, to talk to. Had that existed then who knows what might have happened,\" said Ben.

        "title": "Sir Gareth Southgate: Boys need role models, not gaming and porn",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Gareth Southgate on impact of social media on young men Sir Gareth Southgate says he fears young men are spending too much time gaming, gambling and watching pornography - and they need better role models beyond online influencers. In a wide-ranging talk for the BBC's annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the ex-England men's football manager spoke about his own experience of missing a crucial penalty at Euro 96, saying he didn't let it define him. \"That pain still haunts me today,\" he said, \"and I guess it always will.\" Referencing his own experiences, he said the UK needed to do more to encourage young people - especially young men - to make the right choices in life and to not fear failure. Rather than turning to teachers, sports coaches or youth group leaders, Sir Gareth said he feared many young men were searching for direction online. There, he said they were finding a new kind of role model, one that too often did not have their best interests at heart. \"These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain,\" he said. \"They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, that strength means never showing emotion, and that the world, including women, is against them.\" Sir Gareth Southgate: The Richard Dimbleby Lecture The ex-England manager reflects on his personal journey, belief and resilience Sir Gareth spoke about missing the crucial penalty in the 1996 Euros semi-final, when England lost to Germany. \"Missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me stronger, a better man,\" Sir Gareth said at the lecture. \"It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience I never knew existed.\" This video can not be played Watch: Gareth Southgate shares lessons from Euro 96 penalty miss He contrasted his own miss with Eric Dier's successful penalty kick against Colombia in 2018, when - with Sir Gareth as manager - England won a World Cup penalty shootout for the first time. During the intervening 22 years, he said there had been a change in mindset among England players. \"In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss,\" he said. \"In 2018, Eric had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing he would score.\" During Sir Gareth's career as a defender and midfielder, he played for Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and was in the England squad between 1995 and 2004. He took over as manager in 2016 and led the team to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, 2022 World Cup quarter-final and Euro finals in 2020 and 2024. He stepped down as manager in July, two days after England lost to Spain in the Euros. Sir Gareth has been credited with revitalising the England team and was knighted in the King's New Year Honours in December. Sir Gareth celebrates after England beat Colombia following a penalty shootout at Spartak Stadium, Moscow, in July 2018 He is the latest in a line of academics, business leaders and other notable figures to deliver the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, which has been held most years since 1972 in memory of the broadcaster. Previous speakers have included King Charles III, when he was the Prince of Wales, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates, and Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sir Gareth's talk focused on the importance of belief and resilience for young men, and he cited three things needed to build these: identity, connection and culture. He referred to a report, released earlier this month by the Centre for Social Justice, which said boys and young men were \"in crisis\", with a \"staggering\" increase in those not in education, employment or training. \"Too many young men are isolated,\" Sir Gareth said in his talk. \"Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to friends or family. Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how best to push them to grow. And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone.\" \"Young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions,\" he added. \"They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography.\" Ukie - the UK's trade body for video games - said it was \"disappointed\" by the way the former England manager characterised gaming. In a letter to Sir Gareth it said: \"Video games should be celebrated for their positive impact, as a medium that connects people, teaches new skills, drives creativity, and boosts the economy.\"  Sir Gareth also said young men don't get enough opportunities to fail and learn from their mistakes. \"In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys now, we will inevitably make life harder when they grow up to be young men,\" he said. \"Too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it. They fail to try, rather than try and fail.\" The ex-footballer also reflected on what his career has taught him about belief and resilience. \"If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is much more than the final score,\" he said. \"True success is how you respond in the hardest moments.\" The Richard Dimbleby Lecture with Sir Gareth Southgate is broadcast at 10.40pm on BBC One and available on iPlayer now Are you a parent or a football coach with views on this story? Get in touch The Beautiful Game: Building Belief and Resilience in a Younger Generation Good evening. Tonight, I want to talk about two very different penalty kicks, separated by more than two decades, but connected by two characteristics far more powerful than football. These characteristics have picked me up when I've been down, grounded me in success, and given me purpose amidst the noise of public life. They are qualities that everyone, young and old, needs every day of their lives. They are belief and resilience. Now, I'd like you to picture the old Wembley Stadium, it's England versus Germany, semi-final of Euro 96 a tournament that has captivated the nation, up to this point, extra- time has finished and we're locked at 1-1. And my childhood hero Bryan Robson has asked me would I take penalty number 6 if it goes to sudden death. Now I've been captain of every team that I played for and this is my hero asking the questionâ¦ So, you just don't say no at those moments. Butâ¦ I am thinking as I'm walking awayâ¦ Mmm, let's hope it doesn't go to thatâ¦  1-0, 1-1 I'm not a regular penalty taker, with a process to fall back on... 2-1, 2-2 But never mind because Dave Seaman saved one last weekend so we'll be ok... 3-2 and actually Dave this would be a really good moment to save one... 3-3 What happens if I miss? My brain has now entered the arena of what might go wrong and now I'm in trouble... 4-4,  5-5 In front of 90,000 people and millions watching at home. Let me tell you that 30-yard walk from the centre circle to the penalty spot feels like you've walked from Land's End to John o' Groats, and that's basically how my legs felt when I got there as well. It was as much as I could do to hit the target, forget placement or powerâ¦ the keeper duly saves. And we're out... I feel I've let myself down, my teammates down, my country down. That pain still haunts me today and I guess it always will. Now, that single shot could have defined my life, let alone my football career. It didn't. But how I chose to respond to it did. And that's what I want to talk about tonight. How do you build resilience when the going gets tough? How do you cultivate belief, in individuals,  AND in a collective? And how do you build a positive culture not just for a national football team, but for a nation? Before I delve into this topic, I want to personally thank the Dimbleby family, and the BBC, for this enormous honour and wonderful opportunity to deliver the 2025 Richard Dimbleby Lecture. Since 1972, the Lecture has been delivered by 45 speakers, including princes, scientists, influential business and religious leaders, as well as other prominent figures. So adding the former England football manager to the illustrious list is certainly a bold selectionâ¦ Nowâ¦ there's a slight question mark hanging over my head about bold selections... so I really hope this one works for you! Richard Dimbleby was not just a broadcaster, but an extraordinary man of belief and resilience. The exact themes I want to explore. So, it really is an honour to be standing here today. Every generation faces its own challenges, and today's young generation is no different. Life is never easy, setbacks are almost always part of the journey. I discovered this myself fairly early on. I'd always dreamed of being a professional footballer. At 13 years old I'd been asked to train with Southampton at their Centre of Excellence in Crawley. And I loved it. But, much to my dismay, after two enjoyable years, I received a letter to say I was being released. Now, I'm not saying I was bitter, but I've still got the letter. So let me read some of it to you, whether you want to hear it or not. Dear, I should add \"Dear\" is typed, Gareth Southgate, which is handwritten, you get the feel of the personal nature of this. On behalf of Southampton Football Club, I'm writing to inform you that we will not be offering your sonâ¦ a place on our centre of excellence. Let's leave that there. It was the first time in my football career that my belief and resilience was tested. Fortunately I'm driven and I don't give upâ¦ and eventually I got a second chance when Crystal Palace offered me an apprenticeship at 16. I have to say I really struggled adapting to football being a job, rather than something I did with my mates at the weekend; struggled with the physical demands of playing against men for the first time. In fact after two months my youth coach, Alan Smith, hauled me into his office and said: Look, you're a lovely fella, good mannersâ¦ If you were my son I'd be really proud, but actually you're weak... and as a footballer you've got absolutely no chance. Now there was no written evidence this time, so I've made Alan sit in the front row of the audience and he can answer of himself at the end of the evening. It actually took me five years to break into Palace's first team, most of my mates got released in that time. Let me tell you, its unbelievably hard to make it as a professional footballer. While I faced tough times during the early part of my career, I believe the world for young men and women they are growing up in today is increasingly difficult. Not because they are born weaker, or without the resilience of past generations, but because the pressures they face today are unique. And at the heart of this is the unrelenting impact of social media. Today, young people are bombarded by information at all times of the day, from a device that fits neatly into the palm of their hand, and updates by the second. They are targeted with images of the perfect body, the perfect career and the perfect life.  A beautifully crafted highlights reel where success appears to be instant and effortless. How can this make them feel good about themselves? When I was growing up, the only people I had to compare myself to were the other kids on my street, in my school or my football team. I was a bit of an idiot, there were some idiots over there, I knew roughly where I stood in the pecking order really, realised nobody was perfect. But now you can find yourself mocked, bullied or ridiculed if it appears that you don't conform to whatever is deemed to be the latest trend of the day and believe me I should know. As hardened as I am to opinions and criticisms, there's no way I was going to trawl through social media last summer and read a load of abuse. It wouldn't have helped me in any way to do my job and so I had to shut myself off from it as far as I could. And it seems that young people themselves actually recognise this problem. A recent poll of 16 to 24 year olds from the National Education Union found that the majority believe social media has become more toxic and addictive in the past five years, negatively impacting their mental health, sleep, attention span, and ability to work or study. I'm actually sure this comes as no surprise to any parent who asks their child on a daily basis to put their phones away. The solutions are complex because bad habits have been formed. But ignoring the negative impact of social media on our young people is not an option. In recent months, my curiosity about the landscape for our young people has led me to visit community centres, schools and even a prison, and I've had a lot of fascinating meetings with academics, teachers, youth workers, and coaches. And in all those interactions, there's one topic that keeps being brought to my attention. And it's parents who keep raising it. Young men are suffering. They are feeling isolated. They're grappling with their masculinity and with their broader place in society. This issue was highlighted recently when the Centre for Social Justice published a report entitled Lost Boys, focused on the \"crisis\" - to use their word - facing boys and young men. It found that across most metrics of importance within society - education, employment, health, and others - young men are falling behind. And how sad is this, suicide remains the leading cause of death for men aged under 50 in the UK. That is heartbreaking. Now, I would at this moment just like to say that I care deeply and equally about the plight of young women. By focusing my remarks on young men, I don't, for a second, intend to underplay their challenges, not least around self-esteem and mental health, especially today. I've worked with some amazing women, I have a beautiful daughter and wife, I care deeply about them all. But given my background, and having developed young men throughout my career, I feel more qualified to talk about the challenges they face. And as one mother told me recently: \"One of the most impactful things we can do for women is to focus on improving young men.\" So why is this happening? Why do so many young men feel lost, isolated, or without hope? From an early age young boys need to fail often and learn fast. Falling off a bike, splitting up with friends, messing up exams and maybe evenâ¦ missing a penalty. These are the moments that test belief and build resilience. It's a paradox that all parents face. And as a parent myself, I get it. Do we protect them from failure - out of love and support, or expose them to risks that may challenge their resolve? In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys nowâ¦ we willâ¦ inevitably... make life harder when they grow up to be young men Ironically, parents know exactly what their children are doing in the physical world, but they are losing control in the virtual world â¦. where young people are exposed to far more danger ...and failure is something that is shared with the world. The result is that too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it. They fail to tryâ¦ rather than try and fail. What seems to have changed is a sense of traditional family and community role models. The Centre for Social Justice report highlights how 2.5 million children in the UK have no father figure at home. This is, as they describe it, \"an epidemic of fatherlessness,\" noting that boys are more likely now to own a smartphone than to live with their dad. Now all the experts I've listened to over the last 20 years speak about the importance of male role models in a boys life. That actually doesn't have to be just at home. There's a point at which boys look naturally for mentors outside their immediate family, and is often where they find the role models who inspire them the most. I've always believed \"You don't need to be a Dad to be a father figure.\" However boys are spending less time at youth centres, sports facilities and community events. They aren't meeting the traditional role models I used to meet such as coaches, youth workers and teachers. Which leads neatly to my third observation As real-world communities and mentorship declines, young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography. And this void is filled by a new kind of role model who do not have their best interest at heart. These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain. They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, never showing emotion, and that the world... including women... is against them. They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives. So if young men are falling behind, if they don't believe in themselves, and if they are becoming less resilient, what can WE do? What can WE change? How can WE reverse this decline? Because qualities like belief and resilience aren't something you're simply born with. They don't appear overnight. They are built - step by step, experience by experience, through grit and determination. From my professional experiences, I've learnt that belief and resilience sit on three key foundations: Identity, Connection, and Culture - and that these elements are as important to wider society as they were to the England football team. Let's start with identityâ¦ One of the first questions every young man should ask themselves is: Who am I? For some this question is shaped by their family history. A big part of who I am is down to my Grandad's military service and the values of duty and respect that he and my parents instilled in me. Race, obviously plays a major role. Many young men in Britain today have dual heritage. They are balancing British Nationality with family roots in Africa, the Caribbean, Asia or Europe. It's such an important part of our country. Regional location, opportunity and class all contribute significantly as well. The England squads I managed were made up of players from all these backgrounds. Everyone had their own story, their own values and their own identity. But when I became England Manager, no one had the answer to the question \"who are we?\" What was our shared identity, the DNA of the team, that everyone understood, and were proud to be a part of? In response we deliberately set out to define it. We shared personal stories... we talked about our country... the football legends who came before us... and our place in history. By the end we knew who we were. A proud, diverse, resilient team that stood up for each other... and was ready to write our own chapter in English football history. It meant that when we anticipated racist abuse ahead of games, the players had the powerâ¦ and supportâ¦ to decide their response if it happened. They chose not to be intimidatedâ¦ but to stand upâ¦ play onâ¦ and win regardless. Similarlyâ¦ moral decisionsâ¦ about whether to take the knee before games as a way of protesting against racism or discrimination, became unanimous and obvious ones to take. Players had a positive impact on society and inspired youngsters up and down the country. And that is the power of identity. Young men in our society face the same questions of \"who am I?\" and \"who are we?\". And just like our players, owning your story... and understanding that you are part of a bigger narrative that existed before you... and will continue long after you're gone. That's the first step to building belief and resilience. But being secure in your own identity isn't enough. You need to authentically connect with those around you. You need to feel the sum is greater than the part. That is because human beings are social creatures; we form relationships because they are essential to our wellbeing and survival. No matter how talented you are as an individual, success is impossible without the right people around you When I arrived as England Manager, there was a disconnect between the team, the media, AND the fans. It was clear to me that strengthening those connections between these three core audiences was critical if we wanted to improve the fortunes of the team. It's well documented that we decided to be more open and honest with the media, using social media in a positive way to offer an insight into the genuine camaraderie that existed. This gave a more emotive, trusted connection between the players and the fans - and it also gave us some memorable images of inflatable unicorns. But the most important and strongest connections were within the team. I wanted to really get to know my players, and I spent a lot of time talking to each of them about their lives, their hopes, and their fears. They were happy to talk to me and they were happy to talk to each other. Players looked forward to meeting up. We had fun. We laughed together and at times even these strong powerful men, opened up to me about their feelingsâ¦and cried on my shoulder. And that's fine by the wayâ¦ and I think it's an important message for young men today. It was these connections and relationships that created the belief and resilience  that carried us beyond where we might have gone when times got really tough. We weren't just playing for the badge, we were playing for each other. Now, growing up in a digital age, it can be easy to think that young men are more connected than ever before. But I actually believe the opposite is true. Real connection - the kind that gives you belief and resilience - is becoming harder, not easier, to find. You can have millions of followers online, and not one person to turn to when you really need help. The result is that too many young men are isolated. Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to family or friends. Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how to push them to grow. And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone. When I think about my own career, I know I wouldn't be here without the strong relationships I have built and the people who supported me. My family, who provided a loving, supportive environment from the start of my life, that continues today through my wife and my children. Or Alan Smith, my youth coach, at Crystal Palace, who wasn't afraid to challenge me - not because he wanted me to fail, but because he wanted me to succeed. And the exceptional staff I have been privileged to work with; people like Steve Holland, my assistant with England, who was skilled in the areas I wasn't, and who stood firmly alongside me when the pressure was at its most intense. It meant that whenever I've had setbacks in my career, I've never faced them alone. And that's made all the difference. We need to make sure young men today aren't facing their struggles alone either. That we are there for them, ready to build genuine connections at home, in schools, workplaces and communities. And it means reminding them that asking for help isn't a weakness - it's a strength. If identity is about knowing who you are, and connection is about building relationships, then culture is about the environment you exist in. To my mind, a culture can be defined fairly simply by \"how we do things around here\". It's made up of hundreds of small behaviours and actions that shape the overall environment. It started with me. Because the leader sets the tone for how they want people to behave... and I believe respect is crucial. Off the pitch, that meant players showing up on time, training hard, being open to learning, and reacting the right way if they weren't selected to start. On the pitch, I expected them to treat the opposition, and the referee, with respect. And always give everything for the team Culture drove some of my key decisions. I chose Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson as captain and vice-captain not just because of their talent, but because of their professionalism on the training pitch, in the gym, and in how they lived their lives away from football. They were role models I wanted others to emulate. And over time, we created a culture where players were encouraged to take ownership... where young players were welcomed, not treated as outsiders... and where mistakes weren't ridiculed, but were seen as part of a process. And some of the strongest decisions I took were made to protect our culture, whenever it was challenged, intentionally or not, by a lack of discipline or poor behaviours. And so it is in society. We need leaders to set the right tone... To be the role models we want for our young men. We have to show young men that character is more important than status. That how you treat others is more important than how much money you make. That values matter... courage, humility, and integrity over selfishness, greed, arrogance. The culture we create today will shape the kind of men that we inherit tomorrow. We all have the power to create that culture. Small actions at an individual level ladder up to something far bigger at a societal level. That is how we can make changes in our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities. And, yes, in our nation as well. With England, we gave ourselves the best chance to succeed. And we must give our young men the best chance to succeed as well. Having covered identity, connection and culture, it feels like a good moment to address the definition of success for young men in society today Of course, in football, some people see success as a zero sum game.  Only one team wins the league. Only one team can win the World Cup. And I agree that in sport, winning a trophy is a hugely important marker. Do I wish we had won the Euros? More than you will ever know. But even in professional sport, is winning a trophy the only marker of success? Are we, for example, dismissing the Olympic athlete who wins a silver medal after a lifetime of endeavour, but loses out because on the day someone ran a few hundredths of a second faster? If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is about much more than the final score. It isn't a straight line. And it's not a single moment. Take Harry Kane who was released by Arsenal, I wonder if he's still got the letter, had several unconvincing loan spells, but has gone on to be England's record goal scorer. Everyone will remember Ollie Watkins scoring the winning goal in the semi-final of our Euros against Holland, but not so many will remember that he started his career playing non-league football. An overnight success after 20 years. And of course Bukayo Saka, I smile as soon as I see his name, who after his experience in Euro 2020, displayed quite remarkable resilience, courage, and belief in stepping up to successfully score his penalty against Switzerland last summer. None of them had a perfect, uninterrupted journey to success. Because true success is how you respond in the hardest moments. It's about having the belief and resilience to persevere. And that's the message we need to offer young men today. Not everyone will win trophies. Not everyone will be at the top of their field.  But everyone can live a life where they can constantly strive to improve. Where they can look back and say: I gave my best, I stayed true to myself, and I made a difference. That is real success. And the sooner we teach young men that, the sooner we help them find belief in themselves. When I think back to that challenging, life-defining night at Wembley in Euro 96, I remember not just the miss, but what followed - and what gave me hope. I was in a daze. Terry Venables comforted me while Tony Adams dragged me around the stadium to face and thank the fans. But it was Stuart Pearce who truly understood what I was going through. He had missed a crucial penalty in the 1990 World Cup semi-final, ironically, though somewhat inevitably, also against Germany! Back at the hotel, Stuart sat with me over dinner and explained what I'd face in the coming weeks. He told me about the sleepless nights that would follow; what the front pages of every newspaper would be the next morning; and how, for years to come, people would hurl abuse in my direction, reminding me of my penalty miss. He was right about all of that. But he also had a wonderful way of putting it all into perspective. I remember him saying: \"Gareth, tomorrow I'm going home to feed the horses. I'll look at them and say, 'We lost to Germany again on penalties.' And they'll answer: 'Well what do we care? Give us some carrots!'\" He made me smile, and he was there for me when I needed him the most, and I was delighted to hear him in typically great spirits when I spoke to him a couple of days ago. One of the most important things Stuart did for me in those dark days back in 1996, was to explain how this experience would make me stronger. Now frankly, I didn't believe him at the time. But slowly, Stuart's words proved to be true. He forced me to ask the hard questions: What do I stand for? How do I move forward? How do I make sure this is just one chapter and not the whole book? I will let others judge whether it made me a better player. But missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me a stronger, better man. It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience that I never knew existed. At the beginning of the lecture, I said I was going to talk about two penalties. Up to now, I've only spoken about one. Twenty-two years after missing that penalty, I found myself watching another penalty shoot-out - only this time I was the England manager, we were playing against Colombia, for a place in the quarter-final of the 2018 World Cup. The game has been one of those typical England nights, absolute rollercoaster. We somehow managed to concede in the last minute of normal time, for context England haven't won a knockout game for 10 years and have lost all five of its previous penalty shoot-outs â so, I can imagine most of the country were hiding behind the sofa, Meanwhile I was actually pretty confident... mainly because I wasn't taking the penalty this time. But by failing in 1996, it helped me to understand what was required now. The decisive penalty fell to Eric Dier, not one of our superstars or a regular penalty taker. But a brilliant team man. And this was his moment. And as my eyes followed him on that long, lonely walk to the penalty spot, I hoped - maybe prayed a little â that he would help us to write a new chapter in English football history. Because this time, it felt different. And this time, it was different. If you look at the photos of my reaction, you can probably see the decades of pain. For me personally, that moment wasn't just relief, but it was a small step of redemption. More importantly something in the English football mindset had changed. By instilling a belief and resilience in our players, we had broken down one more barrier to winning. In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss. In 2018, Eric had walked those same 30 yards believing he would score. And so, in conclusion, I'd like to say this to young people, and to young men in particular: Each of you will face your own version of that penalty moment. For most, it won't be on a football pitch in front of 90,000 people. Maybe it's the moment you didn't do as well as you hoped to in an exam. The moment you get rejected from a job. Or the moment you just feel like someone has let you down. BUT in that moment, you have a choice: do you let disappointment define you? Do you give up? Or do you get back up, learn from it, and keep going? That choice - the ability to build belief, to find resilience - is what makes the difference. Not just in football. Not just in sport. But in life. And I believe, as a society, we must do more to help young people, and especially young men, make the right choices in life. We must create a world where they find comfort in their own identity and a sense of belonging to those around them; where they feel they live in a culture that doesn't judge them only by how well they succeed, but by how much they grow... by the effort they put in... and the character they develop; and where they know there is always someone there to provide the love and support they need, especially in difficult times. That is how we will create a young generation, a society, and a nation of which we can all be very proud. And I'm looking forward to playing whatever role I can to help make it happen. Thank you.

        "title": "Mental health conditions are overdiagnosed, Streeting says",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Streeting says 'wait for plans' amid PIP cuts row There is an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\", Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said. Streeting told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the welfare system had to be \"sustainable\", as he defended the government's forthcoming  reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill. Mental health charity Mind has since warned it was important to be \"extremely careful\" with the language around diagnoses to avoid stigmatising people. More than half of the rise in working-age disability claims since the Covid pandemic is related to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, external. The eligibility of people to apply for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - the main benefit for working-age adults - looks likely to be tightened under the plans. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall is expected to set out details of reforms to welfare on Tuesday. When asked if he agreed with experts that warn of an overdiagnosis of mental health conditions, Streeting said he wanted to \"follow the evidence and I agree with that point about overdiagnosis\". He told the BBC: \"Here's the other thing, mental wellbeing, illness, it's a spectrum and I think definitely there's an overdiagnosis but there's too many people being written off.\" The health secretary said there were \"too many people who just aren't getting the support they need\" and highlighted the government's pledge to recruit 8,500 more mental health staff to cut waiting lists. Minesh Patel, associate director of policy and campaigns for Mind, said Streeting was right to say not enough people were getting the right help, but warned against stigmatising those with mental health problems. He said: \"Applying for benefits is not an easy process. People with a mental health problem must go through a lengthy and arduous assessment process, with decisions to not award support often overturned at appeal stage\". Mr Patel acknowledged more must be done to equip people to look after their mental health, but added \"we must remember we have experienced a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and cost-of-living crisis.  \"We have deep problems of poverty, low-paid and insecure work and systemic racism in this country,\" he added, saying mental health services are at \"breaking point\". Also responding to Streeting's comments, Brian Dow, deputy chief executive of charity Rethink Mental Illness, said pressures in the system created a \"tremendous struggle\" for people with long-term illnesses to get diagnosed. \"The crisis in the nation's mental health is very real,\" Mr Dow said. Does cutting benefits actually work? The previous Conservative government had explored, external making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP. Streeting would not be drawn on the details of the government's welfare reforms. The BBC understands ministers are considering abandoning plans to not increase PIPs in line with inflation - the rate at which prices rise - for a year. The potential shift in position comes after a number of usually loyal Labour MPs voiced strong opposition to freezing PIP. When asked if PIPs would be frozen, Streeting said: \"I haven't seen the full plans, they haven't come to Cabinet yet. \"But what I do know is the Work and Pensions Secretary wants to support people who need help the most.\" He added: \"I haven't seen the proposals but you've seen the briefing, you've seen the speculation. I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.\" Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform. When asked if the Conservatives would back the welfare changes, she said her party supported the \"principle of welfare reform\" but \"we're not clear on the plan\". The SNP has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to scrap the \"cuts to disabled people\". The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the Labour government had \"boxed itself in with its Tory austerity rules\" on public spending. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has earmarked several billions of pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. On Friday, she said ministers needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, as she attempts to meet the government's self-imposed rules on public spending. Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from Â£64.7bn in 2023-24 to Â£100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. PIP is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending on this projected to almost double to Â£34bn by 2029-30. PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work. Part of the reforms set out by Kendall will include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.

        "title": "Keir Starmer scraps NHS England to bring health service back under 'democratic control' - live updates",
        "content": "Thousands of jobs to be cut after Keir Starmer announces NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and bring management of the health service \"back into democratic control\" Speaking in Hull, the prime minister says the state is \"overstretched\" and \"unfocused\" The move partially reverses a Conservative-led reorganisation of the health service in 2012, which created NHS England, which to handle its day-to-day running But the government says NHS England has \"burdensome layers of bureaucracy without any clear lines of accountability\" Shadow Health Minister Caroline Johnson has asked if Labour is up to the task of finding NHS savings given its \"failure\" to run the health service in Wales It's hardly surprising ministers want more direct control of the NHS, given its importance to voters, our political correspondent Henry Zeffman writes This video can not be played Chris Mason on why scrapping NHS England matters Edited by Jenna Moon, Jemma Crew & Malu Cursino Chris MasonPolitical editor The prime ministerâs diagnosis of the state apparatus he perches on the top of was far from flattering.  Just eight months in Downing Street and he sees, too often he feels, a flabby, unfocused, overcautious bureaucracy; âtoo much stodge and regulationâ as he put it. Ministerial levers yanked today, nothing or not much happening tomorrow â or ever.  In culling the biggest arms length body of the lot, NHS England; a statement of intent â for a leaner, more responsive and crucially more accountable State.  If itâs an analysis that feels discombobulating coming from him, yes former Tory PM Liz Truss made similar arguments; âthe tyranny of the technocracyâ she called it.  But remember, the re-wiring of the state quickens the pulse of only the most rarefied of souls.  Today amounts to the scrapping of an organisation the vast majority of people have, perfectly reasonably, never heard of. Process matters, but outcomes matter more.  The key long-term judgement about this change will be whether people in England feel any perceptible improvement.  Oh, and as the prime ministerâs first year in office ticks by, peopleâs patience with him diagnosing problems not solving them wonât last forever. We're ending our live coverage on this story - but we've got more: As we've been reporting, today's announcement that NHS England is set to be shut will result in significant changes to how the NHS is run.  Since it was set up in 2012, the body has exercised a wide range of statutory functions, as well as regulatory powers. It also oversees the delivery of services to patients on the frontline.  Below, our visual journalism team's graphic shows the clear gap that will need to be filled by the Department of Health and Social Care when it assumes the roles now performed by NHS England. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey says he supports the governmentâs planned abolition of NHS England, the body that runs the health service in England. \"It was an experiment to put the NHS at arms length, it hasnât really worked,\" he says. Davey was a minister in the coalition government in 2012 when NHS England was created through reforms. Speaking to reporters during a visit to East Yorkshire, Davey says scrapping NHS England wasnât âthe big issue in the NHS\". \"The big issue is getting more GPs, more NHS dentists, more community pharmacists, making sure that social care actually works,\" he says. \"Unless you do those things you wonât take the pressure off the hospitals and rescue our NHS from the crisis itâs in.\" In another statement earlier today, Davey also highlighted the importance of addressing social care.  âWe'll never fix the\nNHS unless we fix social care â and I'm afraid the government still isn't\ntreating that seriously or urgently enough,\" he said. Lord O'Donnell served three prime ministers as cabinet secretary Keir Starmer's tone towards civil servants has been \"nothing short of disastrous\" according to a former cabinet secretary - the highest official in the civil service.  Lord Gus OâDonnell served under three prime ministers as cabinet secretary between 2005 and 2011, and he tells BBCâs Radio 4âs PM programme that Starmerâs rhetoric around the âflabby stateâ has been damaging for his relationship with civil servants.  He explains: âBelieve it or not, if you talk to civil servants and say they like managed decline and that you're going to take a chainsaw to them - do you think that's actually going to result in them performing at their best?\"  As for the decision to scrap NHS England, OâDonnell suggests this has also been âchaoticâ, but may save âa relatively small amount of moneyâ. âIf they can turn this into a way of making better decisions which leads to improvements in our health service then I think it will be justified,â he says, adding that heâs not so sure if this is what will happen.  You can hear the full interview with Lord O'Donnell on PM from 17:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4. Louise Ansari, chief executive at the patient champion group Healthwatch England, says \"it's important that everything possible is done to ensure that patients' care is not disrupted\" during the forthcoming period of change for NHS England. âWe know people want better access to and experience of care for everyone, in particular those facing health inequalities, including disabled people, carers, and those on low incomes,\" she says. \"Going forward, any changes in structures need to have improvements in patient access to and experience of care at their heart.â  Matthew Taylor, chief executive of NHS Confederation - the industry body for the entire healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - describes today's announcement as a \"logical next step\" in a sequence. He says this started with Health Secretary Wes Streeting's ambition to have a stronger relationship with NHS England. \"The prime minister and Wes Streeting are making de jure what has already been de facto,\" he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, adding that Starmer has described the \"experiment\" of having an \"arms-length\" NHS as failing. \"What we're seeing today is confirmation of a reality that existed\nfor a while,\" he says. Hugh PymHealth editor On the one hand the reforms\nof the NHS in England are intended to generate money for frontline\nservices.   Around Â£500 million per year could be saved according to\nGovernment sources â with money reallocated to hospitals, GP practices and\nother health organisations.  Duplication will be avoided as NHS England is\nabsorbed by the Department of Health and Social Care. But on the other hand, this is\nanother reorganisation in all but name.   Politicians from different\nparties have consistently said they donât want another top-down shake up.\nLabour sources say this is about central administration and will not be on the\nsame scale as the controversial Conservative reforms in 2013 which sought to\ntransform local as well as national services.  So the big question is whether\nthis distracts health managers and clinicians from the major tasks ahead of\nthem â reducing waiting lists and improving A&E.  And it remains to be seen\nhow quickly the money trickles down from Whitehall to the frontline. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran chairs the Health and Social Care Committee The Chair of the Health and Social Care Committee Layla Moran has welcomed the \"boldness\" of Keir Starmer's announcement to scrap NHS England.  Moran says that the decision \"raises as many questions as it answers\", and adds she is pleased that Health Secretary Wes Streeting has committed to speaking before the committee \"as soon as possible and before Easter\".  Moran, who is a Liberal Democrat MP, says the committee will \"be holding the government to account to ensure that they walk the walk\" on improving patients' outcomes.  Earlier in the House of Commons, Jeremy Hunt, who served as health secretary for the Tories from 2012 to 2018, also praised the government's \"boldness\", but warned about the dangers of simply swapping bureaucratic over-centralisation with political over-centralisation. Sophie HutchinsonHealth correspondent NHS England was set up as part of major changes outlined in\nthe then highly controversial Health and Social Care Act 2012.  It saw the\nintroduction of 300 local NHS commissioners across England. Since then nothing\nhas matched the size of the reform. In 2022, those 300 commissioners became 40\nIntegrated Care Boards or ICBs.  We have few details of what the scrapping of\nNHS England will look like and whether staff will be moved to the Department of\nHealth and Social Care (DHSC), but experts are clear on the enormity of this shift.  Two think tanks - the Kings Fund and the Nuffield Trust - have said there has been\nduplication in the work done by NHS England and the DHSC and welcomed the push\nto address that, but they questioned the need for such widescale reform,\nparticularly at a time when the NHS in England is probably facing the most\nchallenging time in its history. By Anthony Reuben Among the prime ministerâs announcements this morning was a new target for the government. âWe will make sure compliance costs for businesses are cut by a quarter,â he said. Thatâs the cost of dealing with things like tax rules, and administrative requirements from regulators â the government has to cut those by 25% by the end of the Parliament. The government does not currently publish that figure but says it will in the future so this target can be tracked. And there have been attempts to do so in the past through the Better Regulation Framework. There was an HMRC figure for the administrative burden of the tax system alone published last month, which estimated it at Â£15.4bn a year, external. That does not include regulatory costs and it doesnât seem to be a regular publication, but it gives an idea of the scale of costs to be reduced.  The chief executive of the Patients Association, a patients' charity, says the \"real test\" of the reforms will be on if they result in \"shorter waiting times, better access to services, and improved care outcomes for people across England.\" Rachel Power says in a statement that while the charity welcomes the government's plan to \"put patients first\", patients are \"less concerned with organisational charts than with whether they can get the right treatment, at the right time\". Powell says the Patients Association will be monitoring the impact of the reforms, and urges the government to involve patient representatives throughout the transition. Sophie HutchinsonHealth correspondent Savings from scrapping NHS England will be a drop in the ocean compared to the huge Â£6.8 billion deficit facing the health service, according to the thinktank the Kings Fund.  It said: \"Todayâs announcement lands on the same day that NHS stats show people continue to wait days in A&E and many patients remain stuck in hospital beds despite being well enough to leave.\"  The most important question is how will the abolition of NHS England make it easier for people to get a GP appointment, shorten waits for planned care, and improve peopleâs health.  That hasnât yet been set out â ministers will need to explain how the prize will be worth the price. We can now bring you some comments from public service union Unison, who suggest the health service needs \"thousands more staff\" and help with retaining employees.  General Secretary Christina McAnea says \"everyone\" wants more money spent on frontline services - adding that the service is currently \"struggling\" to retain staff. She adds that the prime minister's announcement this morning will have left staff at NHS England \"reeling\". McAnea says: \"Just days ago they learned their numbers were to be slashed by half, now they discover their employer will cease to exist.  \"The way the news of the axing has been handled is nothing short of shambolic. It could surely have been managed in a more sympathetic way.\" On Monday, major cutbacks at NHS England were announced - putting around 6,500 jobs are at risk. Chas GeigerBBC News The prime minister has vowed to cut the costs of regulation, taking aim at a \"cottage industry of checkers and blockers slowing down delivery for working people\". His key announcement was the abolition of the \"world's largest quango\", NHS England, which works with the Department of Health to oversee the delivery of health services. Its functions will be absorbed back into government within two years.  Quangostands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation. These are arm's-length bodies such as regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall. They range from huge organisations like NHS England to smaller ones like the British Film Institute. Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 - David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK.  The Labour government has set up more than 20 since winning power last July. These include Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet clean power goals, and Skills England, which supports people in finding jobs. But precise numbers - and costs - are hard to pin down, since some new quangos are, in effect, rebrands of previous ones. The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was Â£353bn.  Nick TriggleHealth correspondent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend what treatments can be afforded and what treatments are cost effective for the NHS to deliver.  If there's a new drug produced by the pharmaceutical industry, they will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used. Once they make a recommendation, frontline health services are meant to then make that drug and treatment available to the NHS. The announcement today though isn't about funding. We will get an announcement about funding - that's likely to be in early summer perhaps June. The NHS budget decided for the financial year that's starting next month in April.  The NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4%. Come June, we'll be told what the spending is to be for three years beyond that.  Today's announcement is about the management structure of the NHS.  We've been hearing from our health correspondent Nick Triggle and political correspondent Helen Catt. The live stream has wrapped up - but we're still taking a look at how the decision to scrap NHS England could impact you. Stay with us as we address your questions throughout the day. Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Frazer asked does this announcement mean more decisions will be made by local health authorities? I think they will. We've been talking about merging one national organisation into another. I think what we will see is some of the responsibilities NHS England holds devolved down to regional bodies. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has talked about how he felt NHS England was stifling innovation. I think one of the arguments being made is that this will devolve some of that decision making down to a local level and nearer to patients - local health boards will be more responsive to the needs of patients.  They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are, and that in theory should improve services for patients in different parts of the country.  Let's break away from answering your questions for a moment to bring you some reaction to Keir Starmer's announcement. Conservative MP Alex Burghart says that structural reform of the NHS's management can be a \"great thing\", but \"could be a total disaster if handled the wrong way\".  Wes Streeting told the House of Commons earlier on that the government estimated \"hundreds of millions\" of pounds could be saved in the overhaul.  But, Burghart suggested that there is \"no detail\" behind the prime minister's plans.  \"The prime minister hasn't set out how this is going to make life better for patients across the country, he hasn't set out how much money he's going to save by doing it,\" Burghart tells reporters.  Helen CattPolitical correspondent In the context that the government has been talking about it, bureaucracy is what you might also think of as \"red tape\". It's based on the idea that something is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management.  It's a term used to talk about stuff that people would think of as getting in the way through admin. Nick TriggleHealth correspondent Will the NHS now be called NHS UK? asks Peter, who lives in Wales. Health is a devolved matter.  When we talk about the Department of Health and Social Care - where Health Secretary Wes Streeting holds office - that's for NHS England.  While the UK government decides on the spending, the nations - England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland - remain themselves responsible for how that money is spent in their respective regions.  Today's announcement is for the NHS just in England. To watch and listen, you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. NHS Revamp To 'Cut Bureaucracy' BBC News.

        "title": "'I feel sick at the prospect of cuts to health benefits'",
        "content": "Emily says her autism makes it harder to establish a proper routine People currently claiming long-term sickness and disability benefits have shared their concerns about an overhaul of the welfare system. The government has announced plans for major changes to benefits, which you can read about in detail here. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall says the measures will encourage claimants to work, or work more and save Â£5bn a year by 2030. Many people got in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News to say how changes to the benefits system could affect them. Emily, 41, from Croydon, is autistic and struggles with time management and organising basic tasks for her daily routine.  She works full-time as a flight attendant after developing strategies to help organise her day, and also receives a Personal Independence Payment (Pip) of more than Â£400 a month. But the money mostly goes on her regular bills, rather than on the occupational therapy she thinks would really help her to establish a proper routine. Emily watched Liz Kendall's announcement and says it was \"frustrating how unclear it all was\".  From November 2026, Pip claimants will have to score at least four points in one activity to receive the daily living component of Pip. Emily's benefit is not due for review until 2031 but the government wants more frequent reassessments for many Pip claimants, and she fears that for people like her with autism, the stricter assessments could mean the loss of the benefit. \"We don't necessarily need help with physical things like going to the bathroom but need help with reminders,\" she says. \"It's scary. Even if I'm not called up for reassessment [before 2031], the criteria have changed â so it could mean changes for me in the future.\" Receiving Pip means Emily is eligible for a disabled discount railcard, which makes travel to work more affordable, and if she were to lose that she says she would struggle with the cost of getting to work. Lorraine says there should be more rigorous checks for benefit payments Lorraine, 62, from Northwich in Cheshire broadly agrees with the plans for stricter assessments of Pip. She used to be a director of adult services at various councils and has been a \"gatekeeper of public money\", so was surprised when her husband received Pip for his dementia with little scrutiny. \"I was shocked by the ease with which it was granted. I was expecting to be interviewed, rightly so, but it was awarded without interview and he received backdated pay for the maximum amount.\" She was also surprised that her husband got mobility allowance for not having a car, even though she had a car and could drive him around.  Lorraine says there should be more rigorous checks to see if family support is given, and that \"the state shouldn't compensate for everything\".  At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up What are the benefits changes and who will be affected? Faisal Islam: Hundreds of thousands will be affected by benefits changes Analysis: Starmer's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma Verify: Does cutting benefits actually work? Daisy, 22, from west London, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia. Pip has been her main source of support since she was 19, after previously struggling with a short-term job due to her conditions. She says all the recent talk about changes to Pip increased her anxiety and she had to see her doctor about it. \"If I don't have Pip I'll be a burden to my family,\" she says. After the government's announcement, Daisy checked her records and found she scored four out of eight on \"mixing with others\" so she shouldn't be affected by the eligibility change and is not due for reassessment until 2027, but says there are \"no guarantees\". She thinks the decision to make cuts \"lacks empathy and goes against why people voted for this party in the first place\". John welcomes the plan for those with the most severe, long-term conditions to no longer be reassessed John, 60, in Salford, used to work in dementia care but has been unable to return to employment after a spinal injury seven years ago. He says reassessments cause \"unnecessary stress\", adding that he has argued with officials in the past when he's been waiting for an operation and \"they're still making me go through an assessment\". Under the government's plans, those with the most severe, long-term conditions will no longer face any reassessments, something that John welcomes. \"Not having to be assessed would mean I could concentrate on going to my hospital appointments. Yesterday, I had to spend the whole day sorting out an issue with my universal credit. It would mean I could focus.\" Tracy says not having the right support in applying for jobs could cause more harm than good for people like her Tracy, 44, watched Liz Kendall's speech at a community cafÃ© in Salford. She is unable to work after a brain injury. \"I would love to be back in work, but I would need the right support,\" she says. She is open to the idea of \"right to try\", which would allow people to attempt to get back into work without losing access to benefits, but says there need to be procedures in place. \"If I was left with no support, it would cause more harm than good. Sometimes I use the wrong words. I don't want to be causing harm if I don't have the support that I needed.\" Alba applied for Pip but was turned down Alba, 53, is an IT contractor in Dorking who is currently working for one of the airports near London. She suffers with chronic back pain following two \"quite severe\" motorbike accidents, and during a period of unemployment last year she applied for disability support but was told she was not eligible. She says they were fair in assessing her and in their conclusion that she can do some work, but she wanted recognition for the pain she is in. She says the latest measures seem \"fair on paper\" but worries it will affect \"people like myself who are 'body abled' but still suffering from chronic pain daily\". \"The fact is that benefits are not sufficient for a comfortable daily living as they are, as people with pain and disability require items which are on average more expensive than standard, for example, orthopaedic mattresses to enable them to be able to sleep.\" Alba's current employer has been \"extremely helpful\" in letting her work from home, a subject she has spoken to the BBC about before. \"I don't want to claim benefits â it's horrible. It's not my style,\" she adds. \"I don't want to stay at home doing nothing.\" Are you affected by issues covered in this story?  Share your experiences.

The health and disability-related benefits bill is now Â£65bn a year and projected to increase to Â£100bn over the next four years, with research suggesting rising levels of mental ill health are behind the figures.

Expected cuts could fall on Personal Independent Payments (PIP), which provides help with extra living costs to those with a long-term physical or mental health condition, and cuts to incapacity benefits for people unable to work and receiving Universal Credit (UC). Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed asked the prime minister to confirm that disability benefits for people who cannot work would not be cut.  Sir Keir said: \"We will of course support those who need support, but help those who can work into work. They'll be the guiding principles.\" Later, Labour MP Burgon said that when disabled people \"hear the language of tough choices... it means the easy option of of making the poor and vulnerable people pay\", and said the \"courageous\" thing to do would be to introduce a wealth tax. Sir Keir responded that the Conservatives had \"locked millions out of work\" and there was \"a moral imperative\" to \"help those who want to work to get back into work\". On a wealth tax, he added: \"We have raised money, the energy profits levy, taxing non-doms, and air passenger duty on private jets, but this isn't a bottomless pit and must kickstart growth to get the economic stability that we need.\" Labour MPs have been called in to 10 Downing Street to discuss the changes,  Bassetlaw MP Jo White, who represents the so-called Red Wall MPs, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was \"a moral duty to change people's lives\".    \"It's a generational thing â if families are out of work they tend to bring up their children to exist on the benefits system,\" she said. \"People slide along on that low level of income, perhaps dipping into the black market, but their aspirations are so low and the communities do not change.\" Tackling this issue through changing the welfare system \"is absolutely critical\", White argued, because in order to \" lift people out of poverty... they need to be in work\". But significant numbers of Labour colleagues are unhappy. Nottingham East MP Nadia Whittome told the BBC her party was \"getting it badly wrong on this\". \"We cannot go back\" to the \"narrative of strivers versus skivers\", she said. Asked if she would rebel over the issue, Whittome said: \"I was on these benefits - my mum had to stop work when I was a teenager to care for me.  \"I represent disabled people, all of us do, and we all hear their stories every day and just how scared they are about this and what a difference these payments make to their lives.  \"I can't look my constituents in the eye, I can't look my mum in the eye, and support this.\" Many Labour MPs who spoke to the BBC have said they agreed many people currently on disability benefits could work and should.  But they worried the government's rumoured plans, such as freezing Personal Independence Payments, would punish all those on disability benefits, including those with severe disabilities who could never work. That would be \"unforgivable\", one MP told the BBC. Another said making it more difficult to access disability payments was \"not what the Labour party ought to be about\". \"It's our very DNA that Labour was created to lift people out of difficult circumstances,\" they said. \"The government needs to stop talking about everyone who is on disability benefits as if they are all the same because they are not,\" said another.  In the UK 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions â 44% of all claimants, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found. Exploring the reasons behind the rise, which has \"accelerated\" since the pandemic,  researchers said the UK was an outlier compared to other countries, none of which have seen the same level of post-pandemic increases in health-related benefit claims. More than half of the rise in 16 to 64-year-olds claiming disability benefits since the pandemic is for claims relating to mental health or behavioural conditions, according to a report from the IFS, external. Researchers found particularly fast growth in new disability benefit claims for learning disability and autism spectrum claims. There was also evidence of increasing levels of severe mental health problems. There is a heightened rate of mortality among working age people, due to \"deaths of despair\"- either by suicide, alcohol or drug misuse - and such deaths are much more likely if someone has a mental health illness. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said slashing welfare for disabled people would \"only make the current challenges worse\". He urged Labour not to cut PIP, which he said enables many disabled people to access work rather than relying on benefits, but he backed reforms to a \"one-size-fits all approach\" towards one that provides tailored employment support. \"Trade unions share the government's ambitions to improve the nation's health and to help more people into good quality work,\" he said.  \"A major lesson from the Tory years is that austerity damaged the nation's health - we must not make the same mistake again.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

        "content": "Leandra Litchmore, 21, says mental health is stigmatised in \"our culture\" A new initiative aimed at improving access to mental health services for people from diverse backgrounds has been unveiled. The Community Connectors Project held a launch event at Northampton's Grosvenor Centre on Friday to help individuals connect with mental health support.  The project, led by Northamptonshire Mind, seeks to foster stronger community ties and provide culturally competent care. \"A lot of the time in our culture, mental health is stigmatised; we think we're exempt from it when we're not,\" said Leandra Litchmore, one of Northamptonshire Mind's volunteers. \"Despite your race, we all experience mental health issues... and eventually they will be more comfortable and confident to talk about [their mental health issues] because they will realise it is normal.\"  The 21-year-old is one of the charity's designated community connectors in Northampton, and she said Mind had been \"very supportive\" with her own mental health issues. Stacey Bryan, from Northamptonshire Mind, says the number of people accessing mental health services from diverse communities in Northamptonshire is not representative Research by Mind found that 47% of people from diverse backgrounds, external worry they will not find appropriate mental health support, while more than a third have experienced stigma or discrimination from healthcare professionals. The initiative will also train Mental Health Ambassadors; volunteers who will receive training in awareness, safeguarding, and active listening to support others in their communities. Stacey Bryan, a another community connector for Northamptonshire Mind, said: \"I think this project will make a huge difference. \"I've already had a massively positive response, and shouting loudly about [mental health]... in itself is helpful.\" The project is funded by the National Lottery until October 2027.

        "title": "Bradford mum 'let down' by NHS mental health care",
        "content": "Andrea Mann died aged 61 in February 2024 A husband has spoken about his \"fight\" to access mental health support for his wife before she took her own life. Andrea Mann, 61, had suffered from severe anxiety for several years and sought help from Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust before she died in February 2024. Following an inquest in January, a coroner has written to the trust warning them there had been \"lost opportunities\" to provide Mrs Mann with appropriate care. The trust said that \"lasting improvements\" would be made to its services but Mrs Mann's husband Tony said they had struggled to get support \"from day one\". If you're affected by the issues in this piece, you can find support from BBC Action Line. Mr Mann said his wife's mental health had worsened in 2022 and she had made contact with the trust's community mental health team. \"It was hard to access care, trying to get an appointment, trying to get them to listen, to understand her, to know who Andrea was,\" he said. Andrea Mann and her husband Tony Between February 2022 and November 2023, he said his wife, who worked as a hairdresser, had had four appointments, two over the phone and two face-to-face, and always with a different member of staff. For one of the appointments, Mr Mann said they had had to wait for six months. \"Even when the appointments happened, it was like a tick-box exercise,\" Mr Mann said. \"They put us on a carousel and we never got off it.\" At the inquest, it was heard that during the appointments Mrs Mann was referred back to her GP for medication adjustments. Mr Mann said no other help or next steps had been offered, making his wife feel like a burden and that she was not listened to. Despite frequent requests for a psychiatric appointment, none was offered and Mrs Mann ended up seeking a private consultation at the end of 2023. But at that point, Mr Mann said, his wife had \"given up hope\" and help was too late. She died in hospital on 11 February 2024. Andrea Mann was a much-loved mother of two \"I feel let down. I feel guilty that I thought that care was coming,\" he said. \"They let my wife down. I still feel that if she'd seen a doctor or psychiatrist earlier, we would have had a different outcome. \"It's something I'll never know but they never gave Andrea that option.\" Paying tribute to his wife, who ran Style Counsel Hairdressing in Idle, Mr Mann described her as a \"great mum\" to their daughters Jodie and Kerri and a \"superb nana\" to grandchildren Tyler and Layla. \"She looked after us, she worked really hard and she lived a full life,\" he said. \"She was an amazing person and she gave me everything I've got.\" Angela Brocklehurst, assistant coroner for Bradford, this week issued her Prevention of Future Deaths report to the trust and called for action to be taken. A trust spokesperson said a \"thorough\" review had taken place to identify learnings and work had been completed to strengthen patient assessments to ensure services continued to meet an individual's ongoing care needs. \"We will of course act on the additional areas that have been raised to ensure that lasting improvements are made,\" the spokesperson added.

        "content": "This orange substance under the railway bridge is said to contain coliform bacteria and E.coli Network Rail and Transport for London (TfL) are being urged to clean up a railway bridge underpass said to be creating a \"health hazard\" for residents. The bridge over the North Circular Road has been monitored since an orange substance was spotted leaking from its weep holes on to the pavement, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). Residents also say the underpass is \"absolutely disgusting\" as the drains are full and nesting pigeons leave behind droppings. Network Rail has said the orange substance poses no significant risk and TfL has said it is going to improve the drainage and clean the area more regularly. Network Rail was asked about the orange substance and in May 2024 it was confirmed to contain coliform bacteria and E.coli, but the reason for the colour has not been confirmed. In response to the concerns over safety, Network Rail at the time said this was a \"very common bacteria\" that was \"widely distributed\". The railway bridge is on the border of three north London boroughs â Haringey, Barnet and Enfield and carries the East Coast Main Line just south of New Southgate Station. It is the responsibility of Network Rail, while TfL maintains the A406 North Circular which passes underneath the bridge. The route is often used by locals to access Friern Bridge Retail Park. Alessandra Rossetti, a Liberal Democrat councillor for Alexandra Park ward in Haringey, said she'd begun making enquiries about the issues in 2023. Rossetti said: \"It is shocking to me that years of neglect and a failure to take responsibility by multiple organisations have transformed a simple case of disrepair into a health hazard for residents. \"It isn't right that people in the area are having to suffer the consequences of this neglect.  \"It is time for all stakeholders to stop shifting responsibility, pull together to address pigeons roosting, stop the leak, work on piping the drains and ensure proper maintenance of the footpath. Now is the time to take action.\" Hazel Stokes, a resident, said she walks this route a couple of times a week to shop at the retail park, along with mums with prams, cyclists, and pedestrians who are all affected. She said: \"You're walking in pigeon poo, and everything that's thrown up from the road, it's absolutely disgusting, and it's been this way for years.\" Barbara Waller, another resident, said she'd contacted Network Rail years ago to tell them it was \"dangerous\" and \"horrible for people walking along there\". She added her two daughters \"take their shoes off and wash their trolleys before they can come back into the house, it's absolutely disgusting\". Some residents say they take off their shoes before stepping into their homes A Network Rail spokesperson said: \"We are continuing to monitor and assess the level of risk, with our most recent analysis showing that there is no current significant safety risk that requires immediate attention.\" It added: \"We are regularly reviewing options for preventative measures if the situation changes. \"Our teams are working proactively on the drainage issue and are working with Transport for London to allow work to be carried out, and we will issue an update in due course.\" TfL has promised to carry out additional cleaning due to the issues. Andrew Wiseall, TfL's head of asset operations, said: \"We are working to tackle the issues caused by pigeons at this location, which includes plans to improve drainage.  \"Work on this is planned to start in the next six weeks and will make our monthly cleaning of the site more effective.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

The new Silverwood mental health facility in St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey opened on Monday with 64 new en suite bedrooms. The facility, which includes four adult mental health wards, replaces the previous Abraham Cowley Unit, which was demolished in 2022. The site will include a music room, art room and sensory room as well as sports facilities and gardens. A new garden in one of the wards of the building Graham Wareham, chief executive of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, says the space will be a \"safe, spacious and therapeutic environment\". He added: \"The input we've received from people who have used mental health services has been invaluable in helping us to offer an environment and facilities which will truly meet the needs of people using the service.\" The trust added the new site will cut the use of private mental health beds which can see patients travelling far from their homes for treatment. Construction work on the building, which also has access to a woodland walk, began in November 2022 and was completed in January. Patients will move into Silverwood from private beds in the coming weeks and an official opening ceremony will take place later this year. Wendy Smith, of the Surrey Coalition of Disabled People said: \"It has been incredibly rewarding to see the ideas and feedback from people with lived experience come to life in the design of the building. \"I'm proud to know that this new space will provide comfort and hope and promote recovery for many adults for years to come.\" Follow BBC Surrey on Facebook, external, on X, external.

The 54 bed units at Derby and Chesterfield are part of a Â£150m investment by the NHS designed to improve privacy, dignity and safety for patients. As well as ending dormitory-style accommodation, patients will be given more control over their surroundings, like heating, lighting and entertainment, in a move aimed at reducing anxiety and confrontation. Each unit will also have a shared therapy suite and kitchen, indoor fitness room, online library resource room, arts room and access to a secured roof terrace. The new units give patients more space of their own, aiding recovery, officials said The Carsington and Derwent units, in Derby and Chesterfield, are part of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust's Â£150m Making Room for Dignity programme. This is designed to replace outdated facilities and bring the area's six main mental health hubs up to national standards.  Additionally Derbyshire will have its first psychiatric intensive care unit  (PICU) which should largely avoid patients being sent hundreds of miles away for specialist NHS care. Officials said giving people their own room was \"incredibly important\" as dormitories meant sharing a bay with strangers which often leads to anxiety and stress. Rosie, a former patient training to be a nurse, said the new units would benefit many people Rosie, 24 , a former mental health patient who is currently training to be a mental health nurse at the University of Derby, is impressed with the new facilities. She said: \"They are going to benefit future patients a lot because staff are going to be able to support them in a better way at a vulnerable time.  \"A lot of people suffer with sensory issues and can quickly feel overwhelmed but this is a more calming environment.\" The trust said the new units would help them meet growing demand The trust's chief executive officer, Mark Powell, said: \"Having these new facilities will aid recovery and keep people in hospital for a shorter amounts of time is a real game changer for us in Derbyshire.  \"Yes, demand is growing but our teams are doing a fantastic job of managing that demand both at inpatient settings and in the community.\" Other parts of the project involve Bluebell Ward at Walton Hospital in Chesterfield for older adults with acute mental health needs, which opened on 7 January 2025, the Radbourne Unit, at the Royal Derby Hospital which will be refurbished creating  single rooms, and Audrey House, an enhanced care unit for female patients at Kingsway in Derby.

        "title": "Some Jersey mental health patients ending up homeless - charity",
        "content": "Figures from Jersey's adult mental health service show that some mental health patients have no permanent home after being discharged from hospital A Jersey charity is concerned some mental health patients are becoming homeless because they are losing their housing benefits if they are in hospital for more than 28 days. A total of 22 out of 357 mental health patients who were admitted to hospital between January 2023 and December 2024 ended up without a permanent home after being discharged. Patricia Winchester, from the charity My Voice Jersey which supports people with serious mental illness said she wanted the law to change and \"a common sense approach to be taken\" when it came to benefits. The social security minister said she was making sure benefits were not put at risk by short hospital stays. The figures from Jersey's mental health partnership board, external showed that in total 34 patients were discharged without permanent accommodation to go to - 12 of the 34 had been in insecure accommodation prior to admission. In a statement, Jersey's director of mental health, Andy Weir said the reasons for the loss of accommodation included eviction, unpaid rent and loss of benefit. In October 2013 income support legislation was amended to remove a household's entitlement to the accommodation and housing components of income support if all adults in the household were off island for longer than four weeks, in prison or in other publicly funded accommodation - like a hospital. However, it was decided in 2014 that payment would be maintained in circumstances where a person was hospitalised for more than 28 days but less than 12 weeks, but this would be done under ministerial discretion rather than a change to the law, external. Mrs Winchester, who is on the partnership board, said becoming homeless or ending up in insecure accommodation after being discharged from hospital was harming the recovery of mental health patients. She said: \"People feel humiliated,  they're in a position where it becomes very difficult to challenge service providers, it also significantly increases their risk of readmission. \"Twenty eight days is a very short time for a mental health patient with a severe illness, where they may need to be taken off one medication and put on another medication which is done slowly and it just seems ridiculous that they lose the thing they most need which is a home. \"If they are not going to secure housing then the risk to life is much higher.\" Patricia Winchester, from My Voice Jersey, said becoming homeless after discharge was effecting the recovery of mental health patients  Deputy Lyndsay Feltham, Social Security Minister, said she had told her officers to automatically continue housing benefit for people who are in hospital for more than 28 days but less than 12 weeks. She said: \"People will not be losing their benefits when they go into hospital. \"Certainly I have been signing off on ministerial decisions to ensure people have been able to retain their accommodation and get their rent needs met. \"So it's not my understanding that people should have been losing their accommodation because of losing income support.\" However, the minister ruled out changing the law: \"I don't think the legislation needs changing. \"I think at the moment the legislation does provide for those regular review points and it does give ministerial discretion as well.\" Social Security Minister Deputy Lyndsay Feltham said she was making sure people's housing benefit was not stopped when they were in hospital for more than 28 days Responding to the figures from the mental health partnership board, Feltham said: \"I don't think people are slipping through the net. \"I think what we need to ensure is that the health team and my team are working together more efficiently and effectively on specific cases.\" Mr Weir's statement said: \"Mental health services have been working closely together with Employment, Social Security and Housing colleagues to address some of these issues, and this work continues.\" Follow BBC Jersey on X, external and Facebook, external.

        "title": "Cousin marriage: The new evidence about children's ill health",
        "content": "Cousin marriage: What new evidence tells us about children's ill health Listen to Sue read this article  In a busy, terraced house in Bradford, three sisters are animatedly chatting. It's a big day at their home: a beautician sits on their sofa, styling their hair and makeup. The room is warm with fun and laughter. It feels like a scene from a Jane Austen novel: three women in their late 20s, each of them bursting with personality, swapping stories. And like most Austen novels, the conversation often turns to marriage. The sisters are preparing for a family wedding at the weekend - where the bride and groom are first cousins. Many people might find this unusual, but in their family and in some parts of Bradford, it's fairly common. Ayesha, who at 29 is the oldest of the three sisters, also married her first cousin in 2017. She has two children with her husband and their marriage is happy, she says. It felt perfectly normal at the time to marry her cousin. Their mother, a Pakistani migrant, assumed it was what all three of her daughters would do. But 26-year-old Salina, the youngest of the three, tells us she broke the mould by having what they call a \"love\" marriage, choosing a partner from outside the family. Salina tells us she is outgoing and ambitious; marrying a cousin simply did not appeal to her. Then there's Mallika, who at 27 is the middle of the three. She's still single and has already decided not to marry within her family. \"I said to my mum that I wouldn't judge my sisters but I wasn't going to do it,\" Mallika tells us. She says having an education has created opportunities for her. \"Before, even if you had an education, you wouldn't be expected to carry on with it. You would be thinking of marriage. Now the mindset is so different.\" In the UK and across Europe, cousin marriage is coming under increased scrutiny - particularly from doctors, who warn that children of first cousins are more likely to experience an array of health problems. And there's now some new, potentially worrying data from Bradford to add into that mix. Born in Bradford Listen to the full archive on BBC sounds Researchers at the city's university are entering their 18th year of the Born in Bradford study. It's one of the biggest medical trials of its kind: between 2007 and 2010, researchers recruited more than 13,000 babies in the city and then followed them closely from childhood into adolescence and now into early adulthood. More than one in six children in the study have parents who are first cousins, mostly from Bradford's Pakistani community, making it among the world's most valuable studies of the health impacts of cousin marriage. And in data published in the last few months - and analysed in an upcoming episode of BBC Radio 4's Born in Bradford series -  the researchers found that first cousin-parentage may have wider consequences than previously thought. The most obvious way that a pair of blood-related parents might increase health risks for a child is through a recessive disorder, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease.  According to the classic theory of genetics laid out by the biologist Gregor Mendel,  if both parents carry a recessive gene then there's a one in four chance that their child will inherit the condition. And when parents are cousins, they're more likely to both be carriers. A child of first cousins carries a 6% chance of inheriting a recessive disorder, compared to 3% for the general population. But the Bradford study took a much broader view - and sheds fresh light. The researchers weren't just looking at whether a child had been diagnosed with a specific recessive disorder. Instead they studied dozens of data points, observing everything from the children's speech and language development to their frequency of healthcare to their performance at school. Then they used a mathematical model to try to eliminate the impacts of poverty and parental education - so they could focus squarely on the impact on \"consanguinity\", the scientific word for having parents who are related. They found that even after factors like poverty were controlled for, a child of first cousins in Bradford had an 11% probability of being diagnosed with a speech and language problem, versus 7% for children whose parents are not related. They also found a child of first cousins has a 54% chance of reaching a \"good stage of development\" (a government assessment given to all five year-olds in England), versus 64% for children whose parents are not related. We get further insight into their poorer health through the number of visits to the GP. Children of first cousins have a third more primary care appointments than children whose parents are not related - an average of four instead of three a year. What is notable is that even once you account for the children in that group who already have a diagnosed recessive disorder, the figures suggest consanguinity may be affecting even those children who don't have a diagnosable recessive disorder. Neil Small, emeritus professor at the University of Bradford and the author of the study, says that even if all of the children with recessive disorders visited their GP more than average, \"this does not explain the much wider distribution of excess health care usage in the consanguineous children\". The study, he says, is \"exciting because it gives the opportunity for a much more accurate development of a response, targeting interventions and treatments\". It is, of course, just one study, and the population of Bradford is not representative of the whole of the UK. Nevertheless, it adds to a growing concern among scientists that has caught the attention of lawmakers across Europe. Two Scandinavian countries have now moved to outlaw cousin marriage entirely. In Norway, the practice became illegal last year; in Sweden, a ban will come into effect next year. Richard Holden (pictured) has proposed a private members' bill to make the practice illegal, adding it to the list of banned marriages In the UK, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has introduced a private members' bill to outlaw the practice, adding it to the list of illegal marriages (alongside parents, child, siblings, and grandparents). But the Labour government says there are \"no plans\" to impose a ban. At present, the UK is still following the policy of \"genetic counselling\", in which first cousin-couples are educated about the risks of having children, and encouraged to get extra screening in pregnancy. But amid concern about child health and strains on the NHS, some academics are asking whether a beefed-up approach to counselling is needed, with more funding and laser-focused intervention. And there are those who think it's time to follow the Scandinavian example and impose something bound to be difficult and controversial: an outright ban on cousin marriage. For most in the UK, the prospect of marrying a cousin is largely alien. But it wasn't always so unusual. The father of evolution Charles Darwin married his first cousin, Emma Wedgwood. Their son, the Victorian scientist Sir George Darwin, went on to estimate that cousin marriages accounted for almost one in 20 aristocratic unions in 19th Century Britain. One of them was Queen Victoria, who married her first cousin, Prince Albert. The novel Wuthering Heights is full of fictional examples. Consanguineous marriage remains relatively common among some South Asian communities By the 20th Century the proportion of marriages between cousins had declined to about 1%. But it remains a relatively common practice among some South Asian minorities. In three inner-city Bradford wards, almost half (46%) of mothers from the Pakistani community were married to a first or second cousin, according to the most recent Born in Bradford data published two years ago. For those who want to ban the practice, the public health argument is compelling. When announcing his private members' bill in December, Richard Holden highlighted the higher risk of birth defects. Later, on Talk TV, he pointed to data showing that infant mortality rates are higher for children born to cousin parents, with more heart, brain, and kidney problems due to recessive disorders. He also explained that health effects can be \"compounded\" when the practice persists through generations. This risk to child health is one of the reasons Patrick Nash, a researcher and co-founder at the Pharos Foundation research institute, wants to see cousin marriage banned. In a paper published in the Oxford Journal of Law and Religion last year, Nash wrote that a ban would result in \"immediate\" health improvements, especially in communities where the practice is common. He said:  \"Banning cousin marriage would improve public health drastically and have no negative health implications of its own.\" Prof Sam Oddie has worked in Bradford for over 20 years and has witnessed many cases of severe genetic disorders On the ground in Bradford, it's a more mixed picture. Prof Sam Oddie, a consultant neonatologist and researcher at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, has worked in the city for more than two decades. Over the years he has observed lots of severe genetic disorders. \"I've seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions\". He says it was \"immediately clear\" these conditions were occurring more in Bradford than elsewhere. He remembers some tragic examples: families who lost several children, one after the other, to the same genetic disorder. \"That's very upsetting and very difficult for the family to get their heads around.\" But crucially, Prof Oddie thinks the main risk to genetic health in Bradford is not cousin marriage, but a similar issue known as endogamy, in which people marry members of their close community. In a tight-knit ethnic group, people are more likely to share common ancestors and genes - whether or not they are first cousins, he says. Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK's Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians. \"It's often the case that the exact familial tie can't be traced, but the gene occurs more commonly within a certain group, and for that reason, both parents carry the affected gene,\" Prof Oddie says. \"It's an oversimplification to say that cousin marriage is the root of all excess recessive disorders in Bradford or in Pakistani communities. Endogamy is an important feature.\" Rather than a ban, he stresses the power of education - or what he calls \"genetic literacy\". It's a phrase that crops up again and again from the people we speak to. For many years there's been a campaign in Bradford to inform people in the Pakistani community about their genetic risks. Couples are given specialist advice at their GP; at pregnancy classes, information is shared with expectant mothers. Bradford has long run campaigns to raise awareness of genetic risks within the Pakistani community And in Bradford at least, some are taking the message on board. Back at the sisters' house, all three women we interview say that ideas around cousin marriage are slowly changing, in part due to an increased awareness of health risks. They live in the deprived, post-industrial Manningham area of the city. There's a distinct feeling of neighbourliness here. All of the front doors open directly onto the street, which is full of children playing. Occasionally the sounds of their laughter drift inside. \"It has to be something that happens gradually - it's slow, you can't rush it,\" says Salina, the sister who chose to have a love marriage. \"My mum was very young when she came [to the UK from Pakistan]. She had certain views but those changed because she loves us. I just explained to her, 'Mum, how does it benefit you to push cousin marriage?'.\" Mallika, her older sister, agrees. \"It's also to do with social media and being exposed to different people,\" she says. \"You have new connections... contact with people outside our parents' eyes.\" Even Ayesha, the oldest sister who is in a cousin marriage, said she doesn't imagine either of her two children will marry their cousins. At the time she married her cousin, she says, \"I didn't know any different. My parents were strong in their culture. As the generations move on, the culture is disappearing a bit.\" She was aware of the genetic risks when she had her two children. Neither of them have a genetic illness. \"We did take that on board,\" she says, on the topic of genetic health. \"But I always feel like if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. If the child is going to be born with a disability then it will happen if you are married to a cousin or not.\" One year on: Did democratic opposition in Russia die with Alexei Navalny? Dating apps could be in trouble â here's what might take their place Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it? Indeed, in Bradford at least, the practice is in decline. The share of new mothers from across the Born in Bradford study who were first cousins with the father of their baby fell from 39% in the late 2000s to 27% in the late 2010s. This is no coincidence, according to Professor John Wright, chief investigator on the Born in Bradford project. He points out that it is only recently that his team published evidence around the risks of cousin marriage in the UK. \"When we talked to the families 10 years ago it was very clear that people weren't aware of the risks but like all parents they want to do their best for their children. They want to have healthy children,\" he says. \"Education is the starting point and we've shown in Born in Bradford how powerful that is.\" Aside from health concerns, there's another reason some people want to see cousin marriage banned: its impact on social cohesion. This is what's largely driving the debate in Scandinavia. In Norway, where cousin marriage was banned last year, lawmakers said the practice was linked to forced marriage, with some South Asian immigrant women coerced into unions with relatives. They also looked at the link with so-called \"honour\" violence, according to Tonje Egedius, a journalist who covered the story for a Norwegian newspaper. \"[Police] claim that cousin marriage makes it easier for perpetrators to maintain honour in families,\" she says, \"and that marrying within the family is a contributing cause of honour-related violence and abuse\". Jasmina Holten, a senior Norwegian police officer, said in an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK last year that some women coerced into cousin marriage found themselves trapped, with financial dependence on relatives. In those cases, divorce often means ostracism. A ban on cousin marriage could break down that abusive chain, she said. Likewise, Sweden's justice secretary Gunnar StrÃ¶mmer said his own country's ban on cousin marriage will liberate women from \"oppressive standards of honour\". This cultural argument is becoming increasingly prominent. Proponents of a ban broadly see cousin marriage as an instrument of segregation, siphoning people off from the rest of society. Nash, from the Pharos Foundation, says that a ban on cousin marriage would help reduce ethnic segregation in places like Bradford. Others are sceptical of the idea that you can force people to integrate through the sharp stick of legislation. They say that even if a ban goes ahead, some couples would continue to marry their cousins through illegal, unregistered unions - and that women in those marriages may feel they no longer have the protection of the state if the relationship goes sour. Nazir Afzal (pictured) believes that well-crafted legislation could provide protection for those forced into cousin marriages Nazir Afzal, former Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West of England, tells us that \"thoughtful legislation\" would \"offer protections\" to people coerced into cousin marriage. \"[But] we must respect cultural diversity and personal choice,\" he says. \"Cousin marriage is an important cultural practice in many parts of the world, and legislation should be sensitive to the social and familial values that underlie it.\" More broadly, he suggests governments may want to think about boosting education and genetic screening for couples entering cousin marriage - rather than imposing \"blanket bans\". For some, the idea of an outright ban raises the ugly image of certain minorities being targeted over others. Karma Nirvana, a charity that works to end honour-based abuse, described the backbench attempt to ban cousin marriage as \"a tool of political point-scoring, inciting hate and driving a wedge between communities\". Richard Holden's bill is awaiting its second reading in the House of Commons. Without government support it has never been likely to pass but its very existence and events in Scandinavia have resulted in cousin marriage being talked about far beyond the communities where it is prevalent. Of course, for those Britons in a cousin marriage, life goes on much as before. Back at the Bradford house, the beautician is putting her finishing touches to the hair of the three sisters, ahead of their big wedding at the weekend. Ayesha, the sister who is in a cousin marriage, is reflective and thoughtful about her own near decade-long relationship. \"There are difficulties - we've been through lots together, we have sacrificed a lot,\" she says about her husband. \"But we are happy together.\" \"I think even with love marriages you're going to have problems. They'll just be different ones.\"  Top image credit: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "title": "Maze Prison regeneration 'limited to health and safety'",
        "content": "The former Maze prison near Lisburn closed in 2000 A Stormont body set up to oversee a Â£300m redevelopment of the former Maze prison site has said its role has been \"essentially limited to health and safety\". Plans to regenerate the site near Lisburn have been in limbo for almost 12 years due to a political row. The high-security jail held paramilitary prisoners during the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles and was the site of republican hunger strikes in 1981 during which 10 inmates starved themselves to death. It closed in 2000 and while most of the prison buildings have been demolished, some were retained. The 350-acre former prison is one of Northern Ireland's largest development sites in public ownership. Bryan Gregory, interim chief executive of the Maze Long Kesh Development Corporation (MLKDC), said a \"political resolution\" was needed. \"What the answer to that is, I don't know, but it is clearly in my mind a legacy issue that needs to be picked up and addressed,\" he said. Republican IRA and INLA inmates died during a hunger strike in the prison in 1981 In 2013, Stormont's then First Minister Peter Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), blocked a plan to build a peace centre on the site. It followed pressure from unionists who claimed the site would become a \"shrine to terrorism\". Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness, then deputy first minister, later said that no further development would take place until the dispute was resolved. Since then, the stalemate has led to many requests to visit the prison buildings being refused by the Executive Office - the joint government department of the first and deputy first ministers. However, some parts of the site have been used, such as hosting the Balmoral Show - an annual agricultural event. The Air Ambulance and Ulster Aviation Society are also based there. Mr Gregory was speaking to the economy committee on Wednesday as members visited the site. He said the MLKDC has had a \"limited remit since 2013\" which is \"defined by our sponsor department, the Executive Office\". This has been \"essentially limited to health and safety matters, site security, essential maintenance\" and supporting those currently using the site. Mr Gregory said that \"in addition to that formal remit, we have added in our business plan an aim to identify and explore options for consideration by ministers\". Last year, it emerged the body in charge of Northern Ireland museums had been in talks about the future of the derelict jail. Neil McIvor, MLKDC's director of development, said they were \"very preliminary discussions\". Bryan Gregory, interim chief executive of the Maze Long Kesh Development Corporation Alliance Party assembly member David Honeyford said the Maze site was a \"microcosm of Northern Ireland\". \"The potential is here, but we're not realising it,\" he said. He urged the first and deputy first ministers to \"move this forward and allow the potential to be actually realised\". Alliance Party assembly member David Honeyford said the Maze site had significant economic potential DUP assembly member Phillip Brett, chair of the economy committee, said the \"economic opportunities here are huge\". \"But we're also equally clear that we will never support the creation of a shrine to terrorism here,\" he added. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Emma Sheerin said there was a \"shared objective across all parties\" to realise the economic opportunities of the site. She said \"there are different perspectives on the past\" and \"everybody's perspective should be respected\".

        "title": "Asha: Indian health workers protest for better pay and recognition",
        "content": "Protest co-ordinator Saboora Arifa says the strike is a matter of social justice Thousands of frontline healthcare workers in southern India's Kerala state, who have been holding demonstrations for the past month seeking better pay and recognition, have vowed to continue their protest. Kerala's 26,225 female workers, known as Accredited Social Health Activists or Ashas (Hindi for hope), have been holding protests near the state government headquarters in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram. The protesters, who provide crucial medical support in the country's rural areas, say they plan to \"lay siege\" to the state secretariat in the coming week, if authorities continue to ignore their demands. The Ashas, who number more than a million across the country, are fighting for better salaries and for official \"worker\" status. The women are currently categorised as volunteers, which means they are not guaranteed any benefits from the government, despite playing a crucial role in delivering healthcare in rural and underserved areas. On Monday, Shashi Tharoor, an MP from Kerala, said the Asha volunteers were \"unsung heroes\" of India's healthcare system and the \"protests highlight the systemic undervaluation of community health workers in India and in particular in Kerala\". India's federal health minister recently told parliament that the government would raise incentives for the workers. Authorities in Kerala, meanwhile, have released three months of pending payments. The state's health minister also said Kerala would request the federal government to recognise these women as regular workers and not volunteers. The state government, however, has insisted that the money it offers to the Ashas is the highest in the country. Kuzhipparamba Thankamony is among the thousands of frontline healthcare workers protesting for better pay But the protesters said state authorities had not engaged in talks with them and accused them of instead employing tactics to suppress their protest. This week, police removed the plastic tarpaulin sheet the protesters had tied overhead at the site of their sit-in demonstration, exposing them to direct sun. The Ashas - who get an honorarium of 7,000 rupees and not a salary because they are volunteers and not workers - say they want the payment to be increased to 21,000 rupees ($240.8; Â£186.2) and retirement benefits. The state's Health Minister Veena George, however, says that 90% of the Ashas earn between 10,000-13,500 rupees per month, including incentives. \"They are entitled to maternity leave, and measures are taken to prevent excessive workload,\" she said. But some of the protesting women counter these claims. Kuzhipparamba Thankamony, one of the protesters, said she received only 6,300 rupees as honorarium in October 2024. \"They deducted 700 rupees for a meeting I missed because I was sick and had to go to hospital.\" When the 45-year-old joined the Ashas 17 years ago, she worked only for an hour or two a day, she said. \"Now I am so burdened with work that a whole day does not suffice,\" she told the BBC. \"This is a matter of social justice,\" Saboora Arifa, one of the Asha protest co-ordinators told the BBC. \"Those who work eight hours a day are not volunteers. We have every right to get worker status.\" Earlier this year, Karnataka state increased the honorarium to 10,000 rupees after its Asha volunteers went on strike In a country where millions of Indians, especially in the remote areas, do not have access to quality healthcare, the Asha workers have played a vital role over the years. Their job involves going door-to-door to raise awareness about nutrition, sanitation, immunisation and providing neonatal and antenatal care, among other things. They played a crucial role during the Covid pandemic, especially in Kerala which was first to report a Covid case, and have been credited for successfully containing outbreaks of Zika and Nipah viruses. Dr Joe Thomas, a Melbourne-based public health policy analyst, believes India should change its perception of these community health workers whose contribution to primary health is universally recognised. These workers are doing the job of midwives in Kerala after the state's health authorities froze recruitment of midwives, he told the BBC. \"The maternity care support has slowly been shifted to Ashas.\" According to him, 90% of the women in Kerala get prenatal care like testing, nutrition supplements and advice from Asha volunteers. \"Kerala takes pride in achieving 99% vaccination,\" says Dr Thomas. \"The credit for its vaccination success goes to the Ashas. Their contribution to primary health in Kerala is that they are the only people working on prevention.\" Frontline health workers have been protesting in front of the Kerala government's headquarters in the scorching summer heat The protest in Kerala is only the latest in a series of protests by these community health workers across India. Earlier this year, neighbouring Karnataka state increased its honorarium amount to 10,000 rupees after Asha volunteers went on strike. And last year, volunteers in Andhra Pradesh held several state-wide protests. This month, the state became the first in the country to give its workers a gratuity of 150,000 rupees ($1,723; 1,330), along with paid maternity leave of 180 days, and raised retirement age from 60 to 62.

On Thursday, Streeting announced NHS England, a public administrative body, would be scrapped to save money and give ministers more control of health services. The Labour government expects the move will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline NHS services. Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Streeting defended the reforms but admitted there would be challenges. When asked about the impact on patient care, he said: \"Of course there are always up-front costs. And yes there is always a risk of disruption.\" Streeting said former health secretaries had \"not been prepared to take on those sorts of challenges\" and argued NHS England \"was set up to shield politicians like me from responsibility\". He said: \"I've seen waste, inefficiency and duplication. So of course we should go after that.\" When asked for a second time if patient care would be disrupted by the government's reorganisation of the NHS, Streeting promised to deliver improvements and said waiting lists for treatment had already been falling. NHS England chair warns the buck now stops with ministers 'Crack teams' helping cut NHS waits - Streeting What does NHS England do? Your questions answered on health reforms The government said its main reasons for abolishing NHS England were to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how health services operate. It dubbed NHS England \"the world's largest quango\" - the term used to describe publicly funded organisations at arm's length from the government. Currently, NHS England oversees the health service, working with government to agree funding and priorities, as well as monitoring the performance of local NHS services. Under the changes, the organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), which is headed by Streeting. The reforms will not impact anyone's access to the NHS, with the health service remaining free at the point of use. The government said it expected around half of the jobs at NHS England and DHSC to go - around 9,000 administrative roles. The chairman of NHS England, Richard Meddings, said he did not disagree with the abolishing of the organisation, in his first interview since the changes were announced. But speaking to the BBC, he said the buck will now stop with ministers, saying: \"There will no longer be a separate vehicle that can be pointed [at] to say that's what got it wrong.\" Writing in the Telegraph, external, Streeting suggested scrapping NHS England was \"the beginning, not the end\" and said he would continue \"slashing bloated bureaucracy\". The health secretary tasked Penny Dash, who was made chairman of NHS England at the start of this month, with carrying out a review of bureaucracy. Some of the organisations overseen by the Department for Health include Care Quality Commission, the UK Health Security Agency and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Beneath those is a patchwork of smaller public bodies on a regional and local level. Speaking to the BBC, Streeting would not be drawn on which bureaucratic NHS organisations he would consider axing, but suggested there was \"an overregulation\" of NHS services. He said NHS frontline leaders have told him \"they are often receiving a barrage of commands - sometimes contradictory and competing demands - from the Department for Health, from NHS England and from the wide range of regulators in this space\". He said simplification would set the NHS up to succeed and he was \"going after the bureaucracy, not the people who work in it\". He added: \"Of course, I can't sugar coat the fact that there will be a significant number of job losses and we will want to make sure we are treating people fairly, supporting them properly through that process.\" The Conservatives have welcomed the move to bring the management of the health service back under ministerial control, but warned Labour \"cannot hide if things go wrong\". The Liberal Democrats said the government should ensure that scrapping NHS England does not \"have negative impacts on the quality of care for patients\" and urged ministers to complete a review of social care.

        "title": "Matt Hancock criticises 'wholly naive' and 'hostile' Covid inquiry",
        "content": "Matt Hancock entering the Covid inquiry building in west London Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time. In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\". He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\". At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic. Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of Â£15bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment. He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward. The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system. \"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry. \"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPEâ¦ So I stand by that.\" The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant. Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\". The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world. \"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuffâ¦ but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock. \"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\" He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways. Matt Hancock was the health secretary for much of the Covid pandemic Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing. Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\". In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\". He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\". At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\". \"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added.

        "title": "Major cuts at NHS HQ as more directors stand down",
        "content": "NHS England's outgoing chief executive Amanda Pritchard has already resigned  Major cutbacks are planned at NHS England as part of government plans to \"avoid duplication\" with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). It means around 6,500 jobs are at risk, about half the workforce at NHS England, with the aim of saving Â£175 million a year. The news comes as it emerged three more NHS England board members will leave. This follows recent announcements that chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis will quit. NHS England was established in 2013 by former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley to give it greater independence and autonomy.   Government sources have said the overall plan is to bring NHS England much closer to the DHSC and reallocate resources from central administration to regional health boards. Sir Jim Mackey, the incoming interim chief executive due to replace Ms Pritchard from April, is set to oversee \"a transition team\" that will push through the \"radical reduction and reshaping of the centre with the DHSC\".  The plan will seek to reduce the duplication of jobs between the two organisations. Some of the job cuts could also be made within the DHSC. NHS England chief financial officer Julian Kelly, chief operating officer Emily Lawson, and chief delivery officer Steve Russell collectively announced their decision to stand down at the end of March on Monday. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We are entering a period of critical transformation for our NHS. With a stronger relationship between the department and NHS England we will all work together to meet the scale of the challenge.\" In an email to staff, Ms Pritchard added she believed it was the right time for \"radical reform of the size and functions\" of NHS England. But she added: \"I know this news will be very unsettling. The transition team will develop plans over the coming weeks and we know that colleagues will want this to be completed as soon as possible to provide future certainty.\" Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "title": "William sees how text messages can save young lives",
        "content": "A support service that lets young people text for help when they're in an emergency mental health crisis has now had three million conversations, with 2,000 messages arriving each day. The Prince of Wales visited the project in west London which provides 24/7 free text message support for young people with problems, including suicidal thoughts, but who would be unlikely to pick up a phone to talk. The Shout service responds to emergency messages seeking help, which might come in emojis and text speak, and often late at night. Among the volunteers staffing this service, designed to be accessible for a digital generation, is Ben West, whose brother Sam took his own life in 2018. Ben West says he wishes the text service had been available for his brother \"How amazing is it, from my point of view, after what Sam went through and losing Sam, to be able to sit there and tell someone texting they're not on their own any more,\" said Ben. \"We're going to come up with a plan together, and we can spend some time chatting and we can get you to a place where you're more in control. \"I've had conversations where people have told me something they've never told anybody else before in their lives. It's a privilege to be on the other end of that,\" said Ben, one of 2,000 current volunteers responding to texts to \"Shout 85258\". Prince William met Ben and other young advisers to the project, hearing about helping young people who might have been reluctant to try other mental health services.  \"Young people much prefer to talk via text, it's become their language anyway... they find it much more accessible and much less intimidating to text someone than speak on the phone,\" said Ben. Ben West shows a training system for volunteers to Prince William The Shout helpline was launched in 2018 by Mental Health Innovations, a charity set up by the Royal Foundation, reflecting the prince's longstanding interest in mental health, having helped set up the Heads Together project. Prince William was himself a volunteer on the text helpline, after receiving training, during the Covid pandemic, saying his first shift was \"terrifying\". \"Some of those conversations lived with me for quite a long time afterwards, and you always say to yourself, 'Did I give enough, did I do enough, did I find the right answer?'\" said Prince William. \"It's more than just a text line, it's life saving,\" said the prince. He was told that on 35,000 occasions emergency services had intervened directly when people getting in touch seemed to be in imminent danger. The text message helpline makes it easier for those already struggling to share their feelings. \"Sam, my brother, was really embarrassed about his diagnosis of depression, for him it felt like a flaw and something to hide,\" said Ben, who since his brother's suicide has campaigned to improve mental health services. There are other at-risk groups who can also use the service, who might otherwise be reluctant to speak about their feelings, including middle-aged men. Victoria Hornby said that younger age groups were increasingly in need of help Victoria Hornby, chief executive of Mental Health Innovations, said there has been an increase in the \"severity\" of the problems faced by those seeking help, since the scheme was first launched in 2018. The percentage of messages from people with suicidal thoughts has risen from 25% to 37%, she said, Among the other reasons for getting in touch was about low mood, stress, relationship problems, self-harming, loneliness and issues such as body image or tensions about sexuality. There has also been a significant increase in calls for help from a younger age group, those aged 13 and under, which she said seemed to be part of a growing sense of anxiety and pressure on children's lives. Sunday night is the single busiest time for calls, she said, reflecting the pressures people feel before going into the new week, whether at school, college or work. It's a moment when a text message exchange, away from other people, can be the way to get help, she said: \"You can't be overheard. For some people having to say out loud things that are incredibly difficult, that can stop people from reaching for help.\" The text helpline is merging with another support service aimed at young people, the Mix, and there is an aim for a wider range of support services, including peer-to-peer mentoring and counselling. Prince William spoke of the importance of support after that initial contact and education services to help people before their problems are too overwhelming. \"Prevention is really important, before things go spiralling down,\" he said. A report into the project by Imperial College London said such digital services could help tackle the waiting times for help with mental health problems, with 1.5 million waiting for treatment, including 100,000 children and young people. The report said that two thirds of those who had got in touch with Shout had felt calmer from the exchange.  \"We've saved lives. It's an amazing feeling. I just wish this service existed when Sam needed it, someone like me, to talk to. Had that existed then who knows what might have happened,\" said Ben.

        "title": "Stress, burnout and hope: NHS workers in London speak out",
        "content": "London nurse Cielito Caneja \"You have moments when you're human and feel overwhelmed. My way of coping is to take a deep breath, and if I have a chance, go for a 30-second break outside, come back in, then smile again.\" Cielito Canejo is a specialist respiratory practitioner. Like many of her NHS colleagues in London, she experiences times of pressure and stress at work. The Covid-19 pandemic caused her to reflect more on her mental well-being. \"The silver lining of the pandemic was that it raised awareness of mental health. For me personally, I no longer felt there was a stigma around it.\" While the pandemic is long over, the pressures on the NHS remain. Ms Canejo says she worries about the mental health of her colleagues across the sector. The latest NHS Staff Survey, published on 13 March, has ranked London as the second worst region in England for morale and burnout (behind the East of England) - with a third of the capital's health workers saying they \"often or always\" feel burnt out because of the job.  London also scored worst in the category of \"work pressure\", with three quarters saying they experienced unrealistic time pressures in their job. Across the NHS, millions of workdays are lost each year due to mental health issues with workload, psychological distress and the pandemic's impact being blamed. \"We worked through the pandemic, serving the nation, and we've had no recovery,\" says Dr Chaand Nagpaul, a north London GP.  \"And since then, we've had to deal with the biggest backlog of care in the NHS.  \"The number of patients needing to be seen far outweighs our capacity. This is a recipe for creating stress and burnout.\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul He says his GP surgery is in an area with one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the country.  Dr Nagpaul adds that the capital has pockets of deprivation where health issues are more common.  In addition, he says, compared with some other parts of the country, London GPs need more time, in order to provide care for patients who may have English as a second language and for asylum-seekers who may need more help with experiences of trauma. Dr Nagpaul co-chairs the charity Doctors in Distress. It offers support groups and this year is holding an urgent fundraising appeal to help meet demand. Within the NHS, various services are offered to try to help staff with their mental health.  For example, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust runs an in-house psychology service and offers on-site exercise sessions. It also brings support directly to staff in the form of a tea trolley. \"We go around with a 'well-being trolley'\", says Aderemi Shoyebo, \"bringing teas and coffees to staff who otherwise might not get a chance for a break.  \"We use it as an opportunity to find out if there's anything they need help with and signpost them to support services.\" For Ms Canejo, what helped was journalling, and becoming a mental health first aid instructor. Through helping others' mental well-being, she found it rewarding to her own. An NHS London spokesperson said NHS staff were working \"incredibly hard to meet rising demand and care for more patients than ever before, and we know this can take a toll on wellbeing\".  \"While there is more to do, the NHS is fully committed to ensuring staff get the support they need, and the health service is now offering more flexible working options than ever before, as well as a range of mental health support available for staff, including access to coaching and wellbeing resources.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson added: \"NHS staff have been overworked for years.  \"Through our Plan for Change, external we are turning the NHS around and giving staff the tools they need to deliver the best possible care to patients.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Cedwyn Scott: Carlisle forward on 'life-changing' mental health break Notts County allowed him",
        "content": "Cedwyn Scott started his professional career in Scotland with Dundee Cedwyn Scott says the break his former club Notts County allowed him to take from football to deal with mental health struggles was \"life changing\". The forward, who has since re-joined Carlisle United for a second spell, says he was grappling with loneliness and isolation before he sought help in October. \"I spent a lot of time on my own, and it was similar to what a lot of people maybe experienced during [the Covid-19] lockdowns, which I didn't get because I was at home with a lot of close-knit family at that time,\" he told BBC Radio Nottingham. \"I experienced real loneliness and I found it difficult.\" The gradual break-up of the Magpies side Scott helped to win promotion from the National League in 2023, and the departure of players he was \"very close with\", contributed to those feelings. There were also personal circumstances which meant the 26-year-old returned to Nottingham after the summer close-season break without his then partner. \"As a footballer you don't work the typical nine-to-five and you are not busy all hours of the day, so I found myself in my own company a lot,\" he said. \"Then I started to feel pretty down and just a bit emotional and didn't understand why.\" Carlisle re-sign striker Scott from Notts County Notts' Scott on leave to deal with mental health Every day a career battle, says Notts' Scott And those emotions followed him on to the pitch. \"I was finding it difficult to train,\" Scott said. \"I was still training and I wasn't really portraying it in terms of attitude, but I was finding it difficult to train well if that make sense. A lot of the things I was trying weren't coming off and I think that comes from the mental side of the game. \"When you see a striker who is confident, you see them scoring goals and everything they hit goes in. It felt the complete opposite of that, where nothing was going for me.\" Only a season earlier, Scott missed eight months of the 2023-24 campaign because of a knee injury. When he was given time off in October, he had not scored a goal for 18 months. For someone who had netted 15 goals in Notts' promotion-winning campaign - and been the one to send them back to the EFL with his National League promotion final-winning spot-kick in their penalty shootout against Chesterfield at Wembley - it was a a major comedown. \"Everything was against me in a way, and I found it really difficult so I just thought I needed to take myself out of the environment, try to take a break and have a little re-set,\" Scott said. \"Talking about it in therapy helped. It helped massively and changed my life to be honest. \"I had a light-bulb, life-changing moment during that and when I went back down [to train with Notts] I felt in a much better place to get going again.\" This video can not be played \"Spreading that awareness normalises it for people\" - Cedwyn Scott After seeking help and getting support from Notts and the Professional Football Association, Scott was back on the pitch within a month. He marked his return with a goal against Leicester City's Under-21 side in the EFL Trophy in November. Scott went on to score against Peterborough United in the FA Cup later the same month, but that was his last goal for the Magpies before he left to return to fellow League Two side Carlisle in January. He had spent six months in Cumbria in 2021 when he was trying to rebuild his career, having dropped down to play in England's 10th tier as recently as 2019 after featuring for Dundee in the Scottish Premiership just a year earlier. The spell he had at Gateshead after his time at Carlisle earned him the move to Notts, and his return to Brunton Park earlier this year also saw him reunited with his former Heed boss Mike Williamson.  \"It was really tough because obviously what had happened off the pitch played a big part,\" Northumberland native Scott said of his Notts departure. \"I wanted to be back closer to home and closer to family. \"But I wouldn't have made that move if it didn't make sense from a footballing point of view. To move back and play under that manager and his assistant again, it was something I loved doing at Gateshead and I knew they could get the best out of me.\" In his second appearance and just 19 minutes into his first start for Carlisle, he scored his long-awaited first English Football League goal to set them up for victory against Fleetwood. It was the last win of Williamson's reign, with the boss sacked in February and replaced by Mark Hughes in their battle to avoid relegation. And while Scott is focused on helping Carlisle fight their way up the league table, he says talking about challenges he has faced off the pitch is something he is determined to keep doing. \"The more people share their experiences - I've heard Kieron Dyer and Michail Antonio talk about it - it has really opened my eyes about it,\" Scott said. \"The more people share their own experiences then it resonates with more people.

The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years. Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her. The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention. More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained, external in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness. The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol. But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, external, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction. However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us. Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her. \"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\". Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held. It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital. Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\". She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated. Locked up: Woman held in mental health facility for 45 years - File on 4 Investigates Listen now on BBC Sounds - or on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 4 March and at 11:00 GMT on Wednesday 5 March Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye. \"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous. After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community. A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba. Dr Patsie Staite was in the team of professionals dubbed Kasibba's \"escape committee\" Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital. But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own. Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\". She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said. It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\" Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction. \"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\" The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment. But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment. Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\" The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden. The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients. It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023.

        "content": "The Vatican had not released any photos of the pope since he was admitted to hospital The Vatican has released the first image of Pope Francis since he was admitted to hospital a month ago. The photo shows the pontiff sitting in a wheelchair in front of an altar at a chapel in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, where he has been recovering from pneumonia. Earlier on Sunday, in his written Angelus message, the Pope said he faced a \"period of trial\" as he thanked well-wishers for their prayers, and prayed for peace in \"countries wounded by war\".  It marked the fifth Sunday in a row that the Pope was not present in person for his weekly blessing. The Vatican said earlier this week that an X-ray had confirmed \"improvements\" in his condition, but that he still needed hospital treatment. \"The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy,\" it said in a statement on Saturday, adding that they were \"showing further, gradual improvements\". Pope Francis, 88, has not been seen in public since his admission to hospital on 14 February - and until Sunday, no photographs had been released. \"I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me,\" the Pope said in his latest statement, released earlier in the day.  \"Let us continue to pray for peace, especially in the countries wounded by war: tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"  Since his arrival in Rome's Gemelli Hospital, the Pope has been treated for double pneumonia and other infections.  He has also suffered several respiratory crises, which has raised concerns about his survival.  Earlier on this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City.  His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers. This video can not be played Listen: Pope Francis shares voice message from hospital Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, is the first Pope from the Americas. He contracted pleurisy as a young man and had a partial lung removal, which has left him particularly vulnerable to pneumonia.  As a result of his long road to recovery, there has been speculation that Pope Francis could choose to follow his predecessor Benedict XVI in resigning the papacy.  But friends and biographers close to the Pope have insisted that he has no plans to step down. And, despite his fragile health, the pontiff has continued his work from hospital. This year is a Catholic Holy Year, with 32 million pilgrims expected to travel to Rome.

Prince William made the comment while visiting the Oasis Health and Wellbeing Centre and garden, at Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH) in Reading. He attended a meeting to hear how health workers coped with the pandemic and chatted to staff who were on the frontline. The prince told a small group of NHS staff who use the facility: \"Unless there's almost an enforced break in somebody's career - as part of your career development - we're never going to get to the point where we can look after their mental health.\" Prince William toured the gardens of the Oasis Health and Wellbeing Centre The RBH recorded the first person in the UK to die after testing positive for Covid-19, five years ago to the day on 5 March 2020. The prince - a former air ambulance helicopter pilot - visited the trust's centre in his role as patron of NHS Charities Together. The organisation has provided Â£380,000 in grants for various projects, including renovating the centre, which has a gym, yoga classes and a garden providing spaces for recreation, reflection and vegetable growing. It launched its Covid-19 Urgent Appeal in 2020 and raised Â£162m to support NHS staff, patients and communities, working with a network of 235 NHS charities, based in every trust and health board around the UK. The prince chatted to staff from the Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust who were on the frontline during the pandemic Prince William listened as one senior nurse became emotional when he described not visiting his elderly parents in Italy for two years to protect them during the outbreak. \"Everyone in the NHS is there to care for others so the last person who gets looked after is the individual,\" the prince said. \"I've seen that when I've worked with doctors, nurses, paramedics - they always put it down the line, they don't want to put their workload on to someone else - how do you go around identifying the right people? \"For me, looking into the nation's mental health, if you like, over the last few years, unless there's almost an enforced break in somebody's career - as part of your career development - we're never going to get to the point where we can look after their mental health, because you always rely on the individual to put their hand up.\" Do you have a story BBC Berkshire should cover?

        "content": "Dr Louise Harvey-Golding led the study carried out across Tyne and Wear A study is hoping to raise awareness of barriers faced by Eastern European women accessing health and support services. The University of Sunderland and the charity International Community Organisation of Sunderland (ICOS) carried out research that found they struggle to access services because of language barriers and a lack of interpreters and translated material. Dr Louise Harvey-Golding, who led the study, said this affected their rights to privacy, dignity and confidentiality, because they often had to rely on family members or acquaintances for help. Government guidance states an interpreter should always be offered when patients struggle to communicate in English. Integrated care Boards (ICBs) are responsible for ensuring translation and interpretation services are available for patients. North East and North Cumbria ICB said it was only responsible for providing funding for translation services, but it was down to individual organisations to ensure they were available. The university and the charity worked with focus groups of Eastern European women from across Tyne and Wear and some service providers. One woman who took part in the study said she had had to go to the dentist with a friend and described the situation as \"strange\". She said: \"It's quite a specialist language and it's quite difficult because a lot of people have a fear of the dentist.\" An organisation supporting women experiencing domestic abuse said confidentiality was a big concern for their service users. It said: \"There is a fear that information might get out to the wider community, and we find that actually impinges on women disclosing the full extent of the abuse that they've experienced.\" Dr Harvey-Golding said a lack of translators increased the risk of victimisation and exploitation. She also said that government support should be available to small service providers such as domestic abuse charities to help overcome language barriers. Julia Wysocka, who works at ICOS and supports a community group for Eastern European women in the region, said: \"We hope this study will not only give these women a voice to share their experiences, but it will spark positive change for more measures to be put in place, like interpreter services.\" Follow BBC Sunderland on X, external, Facebook, external, Nextdoor and Instagram, external.

The former Made in Chelsea star ran five consecutive ultra marathons in five days - 150 miles (241km) in total  - from London to Salford, where he crossed the finish line on Friday. He thanked everyone \"who's donated, who's supported, who's sent me messages\" adding: \"That was a wild ride everyone. That was intense at times. That was emotional. I've never cried more in my life.\" Laing, who claimed to have never run more than 5km (3.1 miles) before taking on the challenge, was met by wife Sophie Habboo and Radio 1 DJs Greg James, Vick Hope and Jeremiah Asiamah. Laing said: \"At one point I thought I was down and out. Mentally I was gone, physically I was broken. I didn't have anything left in me. \"Something pulled me out. The last kilometre was the most euphoric thing I've ever had.\" The final total raised was Â£2,053,835. It comes as Red Nose Day celebrates 40 years of comedy and entertainment this year, marking the occasion with a night of live TV on Friday.

He was met by 50 lookalikes in Hyde Park, all donning blonde Jamie Laing wigs. On day three after setting off from Market Harborough, Laing told Radio 1 listeners he feared he might \"quit\". But he went on to say: \"I have to get through thisâ¦ I am just running, it's only temporary.\" After listeners helped raise Â£450,000 for Comic Relief, Greg James agreed to run alongside Jamie in a wedding dress on the final day. Before Jamie found out he'd raised over half a million on Wednesday, he was actually being sick on the side of a road During the challenge, listeners praised Laing for speaking honestly about his previous mental health struggles. He opened up about living with anxiety in his twenties, saying: \"I didn't know who to turn to,\" adding: \"I'm running to raise money for people who are affected with loneliness, anxiety, depression, OCD, insomnia, whatever it may be.\" Fellow presenter Asiamah described Laing as \"an example for so many men out there\", praising his ability to persevere with the challenge. On crossing the finish line, Laing reiterated the importance of speaking openly about mental health. \"It's way braver to talk about it than not talk about it,\" he said. \"This week has made me realise that talking about things is the coolest thing in the world.\" \"Being vulnerable is the greatest thing in the world.

        "content": "An estimated 25 million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa Eight countries - six of them in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya and Lesotho - could soon run out of HIV drugs following the US government's recent decision to pause foreign aid, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said. US President Donald Trump announced the freeze on his first day in office in January as part of a review into government spending. \"Disruptions to HIV programmes could undo 20 years of progress,\" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned. It could also lead to more than 10 million additional cases of HIV and three million HIV-related deaths, he added, noting this was \"more than triple the number of deaths last year\". Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso and Mali - as well as Haiti and Ukraine - would run out of live-saving anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines in the coming months, Dr Tedros said at a press conference on Monday, external. What is USAID and why is Trump poised to 'close it down'? 'My wife fears sex, I fear death' - impacts of the USAID freeze How a US freeze upended global aid in a matter of days  Trump's executive order paused foreign aid support for an initial duration of 90 days in line with his \"America First\" foreign policy. It has affected health programmes around the world, leaving shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs, greatly hampered. The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes have since been terminated. Despite a waiver issued in February for the US's ground-breaking HIV programme, its work has severely impacted. Known as the US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), it relies on logistical support from USAID and other organisations hit by the turmoil. It has led to the \"immediate stop to services for HIV treatment, testing and prevention in more than 50 countries\", Dr Tedros said. Launched in 2003, Pepfar has enabled some of the world's poorest people to access anti and has been credited with saving more than 26 million lives worldwide. During his first days in office, Trump also announced that the US would pull out of the WHO, affecting funding for the global health agency. \"The US administration has been extremely generous over many years. And of course, it's within its rights to decide what it supports and to what extent,\" Dr Tedros said. \"But the US also has a responsibility to ensure that if it withdraws direct funding for countries, it's done in an orderly and humane way that allows them to find alternative sources of funding. An estimated 25 million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which is more than two-thirds of the global total 38 million people living with the disease. In Nigeria, nearly two million people are living with HIV, with many relying on receiving aid-funded medicines. Kenya has the seventh-largest number of people living with HIV in the world, at around 1.4 million, according to WHO data. \"We ask the US to reconsider its support for global health, which not only saves lives around the world, it also makes the US safer by preventing outbreaks from spreading internationally,\" Dr Tedros said.

        "content": "Sophie models for Snag and gets positive and negative comments about her weight Listen to Jennifer read this article  The boss of online clothing brand Snag has told the BBC it gets more than 100 complaints a day that the models in its adverts are \"too fat\". Chief executive Brigitte Read says models of her size 4-38 clothing are frequently the target of \"hateful\" posts about their weight. The brand was cited in an online debate over whether adverts showing \"unhealthily fat\" models should be banned after a Next advert, in which a model appeared \"unhealthily thin\", was banned. The UK's advertising watchdog says it has banned ads using models who appear unhealthily underweight rather than overweight due to society's aspiration towards thinness. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 61 complaints about models' weight in 2024, with the vast majority being about models who appeared to be too thin. But it only had grounds to investigate eight complaints and none were about Snag. Catherine Thom read the BBC report about the Next advert ban and got in touch to say she found it \"hypocritical to ban adverts where models appear too thin for being socially irresponsible, however when models are clearly obese we're saying it's body positivity\". Adverts should not normalise being extremely under or overweight, says Catherine The 36-year-old from Edinburgh was one of several people who contacted the BBC with this view, while a Reddit thread had more than 1,000 comments with many along the same theme. Mrs Thom says she was \"bombarded with images of obese girls in tights\" after buying from Snag when she was pregnant. \"I see Snag tights plastering these morbidly obese people all over social media,\" she says.  \"How is that allowed when the photo of the Next model isn't? There should be fairness, not politically correct body positivity. Adverts normalising an unhealthy weight, be it obese or severely underweight, are equally as harmful.\" But Snag founder Ms Read says: \"Shaming fat people does not help them to lose weight and actually it really impacts mental health and therefore their physical health.\" She thinks the idea of banning adverts showing models with bigger bodies is a symptom of society's \"fat phobia\". Of her 100 staff, 12 are dedicated \"just to remove negative comments and big up those promoting body positivity\". \"Fat people exist, they're equally as valid as thin people, they buy clothes and they need to see what they look like on people that look like them,\" she says. \"You are not worth less the bigger you are. Models of all sizes, shapes, ethnicities and abilities are valid and should be represented.\" Sophie Scott is a 27-year-old salon owner from Lossiemouth in Scotland who has modelled for Snag, and received positive and negative comments about her size on social media. Sophie says if she helps one person to accept their body then the hateful comments don't bother her \"I get either 'you're so beautiful' or 'you need to lose weight'. When I started modelling I was a size 30. Having lost weight since then I'm still on the receiving end of hate comments because it will never be enough for some people.\" Sophie is used to online comments telling her she is \"unhealthy\", but says, \"fitness is not measured by the way you look. They are making assumptions, they don't know me or my activity levels. \"People say 'you're glorifying obesity' but I don't think anyone is looking at me and saying 'I want to look like that'. Perhaps some people are looking at me and saying 'she has a similar body type to me'. \"When I get a message from someone saying 'we are the same size and you've inspired me to wear what I want', it takes away from every hate comment I get. \"If I've helped one person accept their body then the hate comments don't really bother me.\" This Next advert was banned as the shot and angle made the model appear too thin Fashion journalist Victoria Moss believes the \"depressing\" debate shows society is not used to seeing bigger bodies in advertising campaigns. \"You'd be pretty hard pushed to find genuine plus-size models on retailers' websites because even a mid-size is a 10/12 and plus is 14/16 which is actually around the average size for a woman in the UK,\" she says. \"The issue with adverts showing very small or very big models is the context and the provocation. We know people with eating disorders seek out images of very thin people as 'thinspiration'. But if anyone sees a picture of a bigger person they're not going to drive to buy 10 McDonald's to try to get fatter.\" Jess Tye at the ASA told the BBC the watchdog gets about 35,000 complaints a year about all advertising, and in 2024 received 61 complaints about 52 adverts relating to the model's weight. She says an advert will be investigated if it could be seen to be encouraging people to aspire to an unhealthy body weight. Adverts simply promoting body confidence and using a model who is relevant to the product's size range would not be investigated. \"It's to do with the wider societal context. We know in the UK currently society tends to view thinness as aspirational and that's not the case for being overweight.\" Have you been affected by the issues in this story?

        "title": "TikTokers call for 'chubby filter' to be banned",
        "content": "Sadie said she didn't think the filter should be allowed on TikTok without some kind of warning A viral filter which made people appear overweight has been removed from TikTok, after the BBC reported it had sparked a wave of user criticism. Known as a \"chubby filter\", the artificial intelligence (AI) tool took a photo of a person and edited their appearance to look as though they had put on weight. Many people have shared their \"before and after\" images on the platform with jokes about how different they looked - however, others said it was a form of \"body shaming\" and should not be permitted. Experts have also warned the filter could fuel a \"toxic diet culture\" online and potentially contribute to eating disorders. TikTok said the filter had been uploaded by a CapCut, which is separate from TikTok but has the same parent company, ByteDance. TikTok also told the BBC it was reviewing videos uploaded to the app that used the effect, and was making them ineligible for recommendation and blocking them from teen accounts. It added any videos that breached its community guidelines - for example by featuring bullying or harassment - would be removed. Sadie, who has 66,000 followers on TikTok, had been one of those calling for the \"mean\" filter to be banned. \"It's definitely a step in the right direction,\" she said after the filter was taken down. \"I'm happy that TikTok did that, because ultimately social media should be a fun, lighthearted place, not somewhere where you get bullied for how you look,\" the 29-year-old from Bristol said.  She said she was contacted by women who said they had deleted TikTok from their phones because the trend made them feel bad about themselves.  Dr Emma Beckett, a food and nutrition scientist, told the BBC she felt the trend was \"a huge step backwards\" in terms weight stigma. \"It's just the same old false stereotypes and tropes about people in larger bodies being lazy and flawed, and something to be desperately avoided,\" she said. She warned that could have a broad social effect. \"The fear of weight gain contributes to eating disorders and body dissatisfaction, it fuels toxic diet culture, making people obsess over food and exercise in unhealthy ways and opening them up to scam products and fad diets.\" Nina said the filter made her feel 'uncomfortable' Prior to the app being pulled, the BBC spoke to a number of TikTok users who said they were uncomfortable with the filter. Nina, who lives in north Wales, said she felt it fed into a \"narrative\" being spread online tying together people's appearance with their self-worth. \"This is a toxic view that I thought we were moving away from,\" she said.  \"If a filter is clearly offensive it should be removed,\" she told the BBC. Emma, who lives in Ayr, agreed. \"My first thought when I saw the 'chubby filter' was how damaging that would be. \"People were basically saying they looked disgusting because they were 'chubby' and as a curvier woman, who essentially looks like the \"after\" photo on this filter, it was disheartening for me.\" Emma said she was concerned that young girls and boys might see the filter and think they were \"the butt of the joke\" By Jessica Sherwood, BBC Social News Filters - which use AI to manipulate a person's appearance - are common on TikTok. Many are harmless - for example one popular trend makes it appear as if a person was made out of Lego. Some of the most popular videos using the filter have been liked tens of thousands of times, external. For the purpose of this article, I used the filter on myself. I felt incredibly uncomfortable. As someone who is very body positive and has struggled with their self-image in the past, using it couldn't be further away from how I personally use social media and I was unhappy that TikTok pushed it to me in the first place. The filter changed my entire appearance, complete with text stating it \"makes you chubby\" This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content. After I watched the video and read the comments, TikTok began to suggest similar videos from other people using the filter, and even another where AI can turn you thinner. Thankfully it also began to start showing me creators who were criticising the trend, some of whom we've spoken to for this article. AI images and filters have become commonplace on TikTok and quickly accepted to be used for fun - the same way some Gen-Zs and Millennials might remember  Snapchat filters.  But filters like these, although they may seem fun, can be very damaging to someone's mental health and encourage them to compare themselves not only to others, but an unrealistic version of themselves.

        "title": "Oscars 2025: No Other Land wins best documentary as filmmaker criticises US",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Israeli filmmaker takes dab at current political climate An Israeli journalist has said US foreign policy \"isÂ helpingÂ toÂ block\" a path towards a political solution in the Middle East as he picked up a best documentary Oscar for No Other Land, a feature set in the occupied West Bank. The acceptance speech at theÂ 97thÂ AcademyÂ Awards was one of the most overtly political moments of the night. YuvalÂ Abraham said his life was very different to that of his colleague, Palestinian journalist Basel Adra. \"WhenÂ IÂ lookÂ atÂ Basel,Â IÂ seeÂ myÂ brother,Â butÂ weÂ areÂ unequal,\" Abraham told the audience. Their win comes amid a fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, pausing fighting for an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. As they won their Oscar on Sunday night, Abraham and Adra took to the stage with colleagues Rachel Szor and Hamdan Ballal to pick up the award. Abraham said: \"There is a different path, a political solution, without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. \"AndÂ IÂ haveÂ toÂ say,Â asÂ IÂ amÂ here,Â theÂ foreignÂ policyÂ inÂ thisÂ countryÂ isÂ helpingÂ toÂ blockÂ thisÂ path.\" The audience cheered. Adra thanked the Academy and said he became a father two months ago. \"I hope to my daughter that she will not have to live the same life I am living now, always fearing settlers' violence, home demolitions and forceful displacements.\" He said the film, which is broadcast in the UK on Channel 4 this week, reflected \"the harsh reality we have been enduring for decades\".

The film follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Adra and Abraham. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land. In his speech, Abraham also condemned the \"atrociousÂ destructionÂ ofÂ Gaza\" and called for the \"IsraeliÂ hostagesÂ brutallyÂ takenÂ inÂ theÂ crimeÂ ofÂ OctoberÂ 7\" to be freed. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 48,365 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

        "title": "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard stepping down",
        "content": "Amanda Pritchard, the first female chief executive of the NHS in England, is stepping down from the role.  In a statement Ms Pritchard said it had been a \"hugely difficult decision for me to stand down\". \"It has been an enormous privilege to lead the NHS in England through what has undoubtedly been the most difficult period in its history.\" She took up the post in 2021 and played a central role in the official response to the Covid pandemic. Before that, she was NHS England's chief operating officer, head of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust in London and an adviser in Tony Blair's government. Her departure comes less than a month after two influential House of Commons committees discussed her suitability to lead the NHS through a period of what Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said will be the biggest overhaul of the service. As to the timing of her resignation, some words in her letter are significant.  She noted that there is due to be radical reform of the size and functions of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care to \"drive the government's reform priorities\" and that the \"step change required\" would be best served by new leadership. Sources have indicated that the government wants to bind NHS England closer to the Department of Health to push ahead with changes, including shifting the focus from hospitals to community care.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting may well have felt the need to find a new leader, and Amanda Pritchard possibly felt that after several years at NHS England she did not want to be on a tighter rein. Amanda Pritchard joined NHS England in 2019 as number two to the then chief executive Sir Simon, now Lord Stevens. Senior health sources have indicated that the organisation had a degree of autonomy at the time, and the top job she then took on in 2021 was different to what was now envisaged by the Labour Government. Â  \"Wes Streeting is entitled to shape things as he wishes\", said one, \"but the role of NHS England chief executive will change\". A government source indicated NHS England would in due course be a smaller organisation as some powers were devolved to regional health boards. The reality is that whoever is appointed, the government faces huge challenges cutting waiting lists for operations and treatments, and reducing long waits in emergency departments. NHS England said Amanda Pritchard had decided it was the right time to stand down, now that the NHS has turned a corner on recovery from the pandemic and the foundations are in place to make further changes to support the NHS. Ms Pritchard said in a statement: \"We always knew the recovery period after a once-in-a-century pandemic was going to be incredibly challenging, and whilst the timeliness and experience of care is still not good enough for too many people, the NHS has achieved a great deal in the face of historic pressure thanks to a relentless focus on innovation and reform.\" Health Secretary Wes Streeting thanked her for her integrity and unwavering commitment. He said: \"Amanda can be enormously proud of the leadership she has given in the face of the biggest health emergency for our country in modern history, as well as steering NHS England during turbulent political waters and six secretaries of state in her time as chief executive.\" Richard Meddings, chairman of NHS England, described it as \"a huge loss\" for the NHS. \"Under her leadership, the NHS has delivered a huge amount for patients - in the face of pandemic recovery, unprecedented strikes and consecutive even busier winter periods, the NHS has continued to improve performance, reform and innovate\", he said. Ms Pritchard has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. The public accounts committee said that she, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and two senior civil servants at the Department of Health and Social Care were \"complacent\" and lacked dynamism. MPs on the Health and Social Care Committee said they were disappointed and frustrated by the \"lengthy and diffuse answers\" she and other officials gave them under questioning. Last week, when challenged on the issue, she told BBC Breakfast, external \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings, but it's absolutely right that we are scrutinised by Parliament.\" NHS England has announced that Sir James Mackey, currently chief executive of Newcastle Hospitals, will be taking over as interim head of NHS England and will work closely with Ms Pritchard for the next month before taking up post formally in April. Her successor, Sir James, said he was honoured to be leading the health service through the next phase \"as we radically reshape the role of NHS England and work with the government to build an NHS that is fit for the future through the 10-year health plan\". Sir James, a highly experienced NHS trust boss, will be known as transition chief executive with no time limit set on how long he will serve. It's understood that no appointment process has been set up to look for a replacement for Ms Pritchard.

        "title": "What does NHS England do? And why is it being abolished?",
        "content": "The government has announced NHS England will be abolished to \"cut bureaucracy\" and reform how the National Health Service is run. The changes will not impact anyone's access to the NHS - it will still be free at the point of use and cover all the services it does already. Around 9,000 administrative roles are being cut at NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care as part of the changes - amounting to roughly half of all roles at the two organisations.  As part of Your Voice Your BBC, we asked for your questions on the plans and what they could mean for you - below we have answered them for you. NHS England is the administrative body which manages how health services up and down the country are run. It is made up primarily of managers and officials, not the doctors and nurses providing care in hospitals. The government provides it with money and tells it what its priorities are for the health service - for example, that might be cutting waiting times or improving cancer survival rates. NHS England's role is to funnel the money it is given into different parts of the health service and work out how to juggle resources in order to bring about the change the government wants to see. In 2012, NHS England was given more independence by the Conservative-led government. They said doing so would prevent politicians from interfering too much in how front line services are run - but critics say that change has made it harder to carry out reform or drive improvement. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes that overhauling management structures will put NHS in England \"back into democratic control\" and free up money for front-line services.  NHS England is also responsible for other functions like overseeing training and collecting data, as well as managing GP services. There are separate organisations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, so these changes only impact England. Within the NHS and Westminster, the writing has been on the wall for NHS England for some months. Even in the latter years of the Tory government, health ministers expressed frustration that they were not in charge of the day-to-day running of the health service. When Labour came into power, it was clear Health Secretary Wes Streeting wanted more control of the NHS and saw a lot of duplication and bureaucracy. NHS England's chief executive Amanda Pritchard recently said she would step down at the end of the March and a number of her senior leadership team have followed suit. In that respect, it was clear there was going to be significant reform - but this is as big a change as you could possibly get at the heart of the NHS management structure. These are two words we have heard the government use a lot when setting out why it is scrapping NHS England and bringing the health service under closer government control. In this context, bureaucracy is a stand-in word for a system that is particularly complicated, or requires excessive amounts of administration, paperwork, regulations or layers of management. Starmer made it clear he thinks this sort of admin is getting in the way of delivering health services. We also heard him describe NHS England as the \"world's largest quango\" - a term that stands for Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation. Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'? In short, quangos are bodies like regulators and advisory groups, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by central government. They do things on behalf of the government, but are not directly controlled by ministers. They range from big organisations like NHS England, Network Rail and the Environment Agency to smaller ones like the British Film Institute and Gambling Commission.  Their numbers have fallen by more than half since 2010 because David Cameron's coalition government abolished nearly 300 - but there are still more than 300 across the UK. Labour has set up more than 20 since winning the election last July, including Great British Energy and Skills England. The total budget for quangos in 2022/23 - when the latest figures were published - was Â£353bn. We do not yet know all of the detail about how health services in England will be managed in the future but it is likely that some of the responsibilities NHS England currently holds will be devolved down to regional bodies. One of the arguments being made about NHS reform is that if you move decision-making down to a local level and nearer to patients, it will be health leaders who are more attuned to the needs of patients in the area making those calls. They will know what local populations need and where the weaknesses are - and that, in theory, could improve services for patients in different parts of the country. Thursday's announcement was not about funding - that is expected in the summer. We already know NHS is getting an uplift of about 3-4% next year and we do not yet know what spending will look like beyond that. But government sources believe scrapping NHS England will save the government Â£500m a year. On access to medicines, it is the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - which is separate from NHS England - which sets the guidelines on what treatments are judged affordable and cost effective. When a new drug is produced by the pharmaceutical industry, the institute will decide if the NHS can afford it and whether it is better than other drugs that are used.

        "title": "Israel-Hamas war: Fresh wave of Israeli strikes in Gaza",
        "content": "This video can not be played BBC Verify: mapping Israel's wave of strikes The UN says that one of its workers has been killed and others injured after a compound in Gaza was damaged on Wednesday, adding that the circumstances of the incident remain unclear. The Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry blamed an Israeli strike and said five critically injured foreign workers had arrived in hospital. Israel's military denied striking the UN compound in Deir al-Balah. It comes after Israel said it was resuming fighting in Gaza following a two-month ceasefire - launching a wave of strikes that killed more than 400 people, according to Gaza's health ministry. On Tuesday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had \"resumed combat in full force\". A day later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was extending ground operations in Gaza up to the Netzarim corridor, which divides the north and south of the strip. Troops moved into the area \"to create a partial buffer between northern and southern Gaza\", the military added. The UN initially said two of its workers had been killed but later clarified that the second person was not a staff member. The UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said an \"explosive ordnance was dropped or fired\" at the building, which was in an \"isolated\" location. It added there was no confirmation on the nature of the incident or the type of artillery used. UNOPS executive director Jorge Moreira da Silva described the incident as \"not an accident\" and added that \"UN personnel and its premises must be protected by all sides\". In a statement, a spokesperson for UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said two guesthouses were hit and called for a full investigation. Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people  - two still wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car. Separately, at least 20 people were killed in air strikes across Gaza overnight, after Israel said it was resuming fighting in the Palestinian territory. Two civilians were killed and five others injured when an Israeli drone hit a tent near the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reports, citing Red Crescent medics. Israel's army said it had targeted what it called a Hamas military site, from where the group was preparing to fire into Israel. Vessels controlled by Hamas were also hit, the army said.  The bombing is not of the same scale as it was on Tuesday - but it shows no let-up in Israel's fresh assault.  Tom Fletcher, the UN's under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, said of Tuesday's strikes that \"the intensity of the killings is now off the scale\". Wafa says a woman and child were killed in an air strike north of Khan Younis overnight into Wednesday, while four others were killed in a strike in Gaza City. Gaza's health ministry said that 436 people had been killed in strikes since Tuesday, including 183 children. Tuesday's strikes constituted the heaviest bombardment since a fragile ceasefire and hostage exchange deal came into effect on 19 January, and came after Israel and Hamas failed to agree how to take it beyond an initial phase. Why has Israel bombed Gaza and what next for ceasefire deal? 'Once again, fear has gripped the people' The deal involves three stages, and negotiations on the second stage were meant to have started six weeks ago - but this did not happen. Under the proposed second phase, Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza - but Israel and the US instead pushed for an extension of the first phase, with more hostages being released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners.  Netanyahu cast the resumption of fighting as a return to Israel's primary aims - to return the hostages and \"get rid\" of Hamas - but families of hostages have criticised the decision, saying it showed the government had given up on their loved ones. Thousands of Israelis have joined a protest in Jerusalem, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and restarting the offensive in Gaza without regard for the hostages. Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. People gathered in Jerusalem on Wednesday to protest against the fresh offensive in Gaza Egypt, a mediator in talks, said the fresh strikes were a \"blatant\" violation of the ceasefire. Israel previously imposed a total halt on all humanitarian aid entering Gaza, causing widespread international alarm. \"For two weeks now, our food supplies are rotting at the borders, the medicines are expiring, the water's been cut off, the power's been cut off - and all that to punish civilians further,\" Mr Fletcher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said he had spoken to the UN security council on Tuesday in a bid to lift the blockade and get the ceasefire deal back on track, including the release of hostages. \"I'm not asking for the moon here,\" the UN chief added. He said his team would \"carry on going\" in Gaza because they are \"determined to do everything they can to save as many survivors as possible. \"They're saying to us: What does it say about our values that we can't stop a 21st Century atrocity happening before our eyes - and not just happening, but being cheered on before our eyes?\" Hamas has confirmed that several of its leaders were killed in Tuesday's strikes, including its de facto head of government, Essam a-Da'lees.  Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad - whose fighters participated in the 7 October 2023 attack which triggered the current conflict - said the prominent spokesman of its armed wing, known as Abu Hamza, was killed.  However, there were also many civilians, including dozens of children, thought to be among the dead.  Regional mediators are now said to be pushing Hamas to release some of the Israeli hostages it still holds in exchange for a de-escalation.  But Netanyahu has said that going forward, all ceasefire talks will take place \"under fire\". The 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas on Israel saw about 1,200 people killed and the capturing of 251 hostages - 25 of whom were released alive during the first phase of the ceasefire. Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which has killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as well as causing large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure.

        "title": "India bans two drugs behind opioid crisis in West Africa",
        "content": "Mumbai-based Aveo had been selling the addictive combination in West Africa Indian authorities have banned two highly-addictive opioids in response to a BBC investigation which found they were fuelling a public health crisis in parts of West Africa. In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exporting a harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into \"the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population\". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill.  Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Nigerian authorities store illegal drugs they have seized - mostly opioids - in a warehouse in Lagos Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. This video can not be played Filmed secretly, Vinod Sharma said Aveo's cocktail drug was \"very harmful\", adding \"this is business\". In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\".  Sharma in response replies \"OK,\" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\".  Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding that \"nowadays, this is business\". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was \"fully prepared\" to take action against anyone involved in \"illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country\". The FDA has been instructed to carry out further inspections to prevent the supply of the drugs, it said.

        "title": "Rishi Sunak 'honoured' to become prostate cancer ambassador",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak met workers developing a new blood test for the disease last week Former prime minister Rishi Sunak has said he is \"honoured\" to become a prostate cancer charity ambassador. He will support Prostate Cancer Research's campaign to introduce a national screening programme for men at high risk of the disease. He met workers developing a new blood test at the laboratories of British cancer diagnostics company Oxford BioDynamics last week. The EpiSwitch PSE test is said to be able to detect prostate cancer with 94% accuracy, which the charity called a \"significant improvement\" on the most commonly used prostate-specific antigen test. Sunak said he hoped his work for the charity would encourage more men to get tested Former Conservative leader Sunak, who is the MP for Richmond and Northallerton, said he wanted to \"support the charity's mission to revolutionise diagnosis and treatment\". \"Men tend to ignore pain hoping it'll go away rather than going to see the GP, and that's a part of the reason why prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males in the UK,\" he said. \"We can do something about that. It is clear from a trial that I funded when I was in office, that early detection saves lives.\" He added he hoped his work for the charity would encourage more men to get a screening test \"which will hopefully prevent further needless deaths\". Last month in the House of Commons, he pressed the government to consider increasing screenings for high-risk groups. Iain Ross, executive chairman of Oxford BioDynamics, said more than nine out of 10 men who received a positive EpiSwitch PSE result would have prostate cancer confirmed. This can \"significantly cut\" the number of \"expensive and unnecessary MRI scans\" and invasive prostate biopsies, he added. Oliver Kemp, chief executive of Prostate Cancer Research, called Sunak's support \"invaluable\". \"Rishi's advocacy will help us drive forward innovative research, challenge health inequalities, and ensure that more lives are saved,\" he added.

        "title": "Plan to freeze PIP disability benefits may be dropped",
        "content": "The work and pensions secretary will unveil changes to the benefits system next week Ministers are considering abandoning plans to freeze some disability benefits, the BBC understands. Initial reports had suggested Personal Independence Payments (PIP) would not rise in line with inflation for a year, but many usually loyal Labour MPs have voiced strong opposition in meetings in No10, as well as to party whips and ministers. The eligibility criteria for PIP will be tightened with the government expected to cut billions of pounds from the welfare budget, but dropping the freeze could avoid a potentially damaging vote in the Commons.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he had not seen the plans but Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall wanted \"to support people who need help the most\". Could Starmer be in for a benefits rebellion as tribes clash in his own party? Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions Does cutting benefits actually work? Streeting told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"I haven't seen the proposals but you've seen the briefing, you've seen the speculation, I think the moral of the story is wait for the plans.\" On the same programme, Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott accused the government of being \"all over the place and divided\" over welfare reform. Kendall will set out details of reforms to welfare in a green paper next week. Part of the reform will also include a \"right to try\" guarantee - allowing people with disabilities the opportunity to take up employment without the risk of losing their benefits if it does not work out.  Streeting said he thought there was an \"overdiagnosis\" of mental health conditions with \"too many people being written off\" and not getting the support they need. \"So if you can get that support to people much earlier, then you can help people to either stay in work or get back to work,\" he added. After Liz Kendell lays out her plans, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will then reveal the full scale of welfare spending reductions, expected to be between Â£5bn and Â£6bn, in her Spring Statement on 26 March.   On Friday she said the government needed to \"get a grip\" on the welfare bill, saying the system is not working for the taxpayer or recipients.  Total spending on health and disability benefits is forecast to rise from Â£64.7bn in 2023-24 to Â£100.7bn in 2029-30. The biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is PIP. In 2023-24, PIP totalled Â£18bn, a figure projected to almost double to Â£34bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million. PIP is intended to help with the extra living costs for people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition. Some recipients are in work and argue it provides essential support enabling them to remain in employment. But it also goes to those who are heavily disabled and unable to work. With Labour holding a large Commons majority, a freeze to PIP would be likely to pass a vote, but internal divisions would be highlighted. Sources told the BBC the measures to be announced would still be difficult and restricting who qualifies for PIP was likely to concern some Labour MPs. Even with the tighter eligibility measures planned, sources said spending on PIP would still rise but not as quickly as otherwise forecast. A number of MPs broadly supportive of welfare reform have told the BBC they have received assurances that severely disabled people would not be expected to work and would not lose entitlement to benefits. The expected changes to the benefit system come after the government announced it would be axing NHS England, the arms-length body currently responsible for running the health service in England.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: \"We have been clear that the current welfare system is broken and needs reform, so that it helps long-term sick and disabled people who can work to find employment, ensuring people receive the support they need, while being fair to the taxpayer. \"Without reform more people will be locked out of jobs, despite many wanting to work. That is not just bad for the economy, it's bad for people too.\" Disability benefit cuts test loyalty of Labour MPs Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "content": "An annual injection designed to guard against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has completed an important early safety trial, researchers report in The Lancet, external medical journal.  Lenacapavir stops the virus from replicating inside cells.  If future trials go well - now it has passed the first, Phase I, testing hurdle - it could become the longest-acting form of HIV prevention available.  Currently, people can take daily pills or sometimes have injections every eight weeks, external, for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), to reduce their risk.  PrEP tablets are highly effective but taking them every day can be difficult. About 39.9 million people are living with HIV, 65% of them in the World Health Organization African Region, according to the most recent figures, for 2023. And the WHO, Global Fund and Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and Aids (UNAids) are all working on strategies to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, which include improving access to medicines such as PrEP.  For the trial, 40 people without HIV were injected into the muscle with lenacapavir, with no major side effects or safety concerns. And after 56 weeks, the medicine was still detectable in their bodies. Future trials must include more diverse participants, the researchers told the 2025 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, external. But they added: \"Yearly dosing of lenacapavir has the potential to further decrease current barriers to PrEP by increasing the uptake of, persistence on, and, therefore, scalability of PrEP.\" Richard Angell, from the Terrence Higgins Trust HIV charity, said: \"PrEP as a daily pill has been a game-changer in our HIV response. \"The prospect of 'safe' annual injectable PrEP is as exciting as it is transformational. \"It's great to see these early results that suggest injectable PrEP might be effective for up to 12 months. \"We need to get ready for its rollout now and fund sexual-health clinics to do so.\" Access to PrEP had been variable, Mr Angell said, creating inequalities.  \"The oral pill is still not available in prisons, online or in community pharmacy,\" he said. \"The Scottish Medicines Consortium has finally approved two-monthly PrEP injections for use in Scotland - but we are waiting for NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approval for use in England.\" Scientists say they can cut HIV out of cells Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "title": "Measles cases pick up as RFK promotes unproven treatments",
        "content": "Doctors in western Texas are holding vaccine clinics to try to improve uptake Cases of the incredibly contagious measles virus are continuing to rise in Texas and across the US as the nation's top health official promotes treatments not supported by health experts.  To date this year, the US has recorded more than 250 measles cases across several states, including Oklahoma, Alaska, California, Georgia, Florida, New York, Kentucky and Rhode Island.  The epicentre remains in western Texas and neighbouring New Mexico, where two unvaccinated people have died from the virus.  It comes as Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr continues to focus on unproven treatments like cod liver oil, and his casting doubt on the safety of the vaccines.  The BBC has contacted the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for comment. Measles is a dangerous virus that has no cure and can lead to a host of complications, including pneumonia and brain swelling. It can be deadly.  Vaccination rates must be 95% or higher for the broader population to be protected, but several communities where the virus is spreading have rates well below that. The US declared measles eliminated in 2000, but outbreaks have continued to crop up in recent years as anti-vaccine sentiments have grown.  Health officials say cases have shown no signs of slowing down in western Texas, where two pregnant women recently reported infections.  Across the state's border, New Mexico now has more than 30 cases, while new infections have been confirmed in Oklahoma, New York and in Los Angeles this week.   In several instances, unvaccinated Americans have spread measles to others after contracting the virus outside of the country, including on Long Island in New York, where a baby caught the virus while traveling with family, health officials say.  Cases are also on the rise in Canada, which has reported 146 infections.  Kennedy has so far offered mixed messages about the outbreaks.  At first, he suggested the rising cases were \"not unusual\" for the US, before backtracking and calling the situation \"serious\". Then, this week, in an interview with Fox News, Kennedy suggested cod liver oil and other alternative measles treatments had proven \"miraculous\".  The remarks are resonating with some residents in western Texas, said Ron Cook, a family physician and health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak in Lubbock, where a child died of measles this month.  There, a handful of physicians, external are handing out cod liver oil to parents of sick children who are sceptical of measles immunizations, Dr Cook said. One physician told NBC News he was just trying to help families with the alternative treatment \"like Bobby Kennedy is trying to do\".  Vitamin A - a nutrient found in cod liver oil - is sometimes offered as a part of a treatment for measles, especially if someone is deficient, Dr Cook said. But, he added, it is difficult to monitor the levels of the vitamin in cod liver oil, which could endanger children if they are given too much of the vitamin or other nutrients it contains.  \"What disappoints me the most is that they're not talking about the vaccine,\" Dr Cook said. He said he believed that it was a missed opportunity to engage with vaccine-sceptical communities to help slow the spread of measles. Kennedy, this week, offered a conditional endorsement of the vaccine, telling Fox News it was \"recommended\" for the Texas Mennonite community - the origin of the outbreak - while also suggesting some of the children had been harmed by the vaccines, which have been thoroughly studied and found to be safe.  This week, the Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit that Kennedy founded, updated and re-promoted a 2021 book in which Kennedy called measles vaccines \"risky\".  \"Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to 'do something,'\" he said, adding that benefits of the vaccine had been \"exaggerated\".

        "content": "James Lee Williams, better known as drag star The Vivienne, died from a cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine, their family has said. The performer's sister Chanel Williams said her family \"continue to be completely devastated\" by the death of the 32-year-old and will be working with a substance abuse charity to raise awareness of the dangers of the drug. The RuPaul's Drag Race UK winner was found dead at their home in Cheshire in January, with celebrities and fans around the world paying tribute. An inquest is scheduled to take place in June. Cheshire Police said there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the performer's death. Simon Jones, Williams' manager and close friend, said the family felt it was important to share the circumstances of their death. He said: \"I hope by us releasing this information we can raise awareness about the dangers of ongoing ketamine usage and what it can do to your body.\" Williams, who grew up in Colwyn Bay in north Wales before moving to Liverpool, won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019 and went on to have a varied career in TV and theatre. They later became the only queen from a UK series to compete on the US version of Drag Race All Stars. Their family said they \"brought the sparkle to life\" and will be missed \"for eternity\" during an emotional vigil in Liverpool shortly after Williams' death. Celebrities including singer Jade Thirlwall and Ian \"H\" Watkins from Steps, as well as several fellow drag queens, attended the funeral alongside family and friends in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, at the end of January. Singers Jade Thirlwall and Marcus Collins attended The Vivienne's funeral in January The Vivienne was praised for raising awareness of substance abuse during their time competing on series one of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, where they openly discussed how they sought help for their ketamine addiction. The Williams family now hopes to continue this legacy by working with substance abuse charity Adferiad on a campaign aimed at opening up conversations about substance abuse and addiction. Speaking for the family, Ms Williams said: \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous drug that is becoming more and more prevalent in the UK. \"If we can help raise awareness of the dangers of this drug and help people who may be dealing with ketamine addiction then something positive will come from this complete tragedy.\" Ketamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically, but its usage as an illegal substance is growing among young people. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System. Donna Chavez, a spokesperson for Adferiad, which runs a specialist detox and rehabilitation centre, said they were \"incredibly grateful\" to Williams' family for their support. She added: \"Their courage in sharing James' story will help raise vital awareness of the devastating impact substance use can have. \"We are seeing a worrying rise in the number of people using ketamine, often unaware of the serious risks it poses to their physical and mental health. \"By opening conversations and challenging misconceptions, we can help prevent further tragedies and support those in need to find hope and recovery.\" If you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.

        "title": "Bacterial vaginosis: Common vaginal 'imbalance' may be an STI",
        "content": "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers. The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex. However, a study, external claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.  The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection. BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell. The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery. Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though. Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching. It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams. In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics. The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach. One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI. \"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added. In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.  Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected â that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".  \"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.  If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic.

Action could involve reducing their opening hours and cutting other services, such as delivering medicines to people's homes. The government said the move would cause \"unnecessary disruption for patients\" and a settlement with pharmacies was already being worked on. A pharmacy's NHS contract accounts for about 90% of its revenue, on average. And with increases in National Insurance, the National Living Wage and business rates, from 1 April, pharmacies say the lack of agreement over their contract is causing worry and uncertainty. This comes on top of a decade of cuts to funding, which has seen 30 pharmacies close since the start of this year, the NPA says. Some 3,000 pharmacy owners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland voted in favour of action, in November. This could involve cutting pharmacy opening times to 40 hours a week, which is the minimum set out in the current NHS contract, with shops less likely to be open at weekends and in the evenings. Pharmacies may also decide to stop offering other services not in their current contract, such as stop smoking and addiction support, and emergency contraception. Hundreds of pharmacies could close - trade body 'I can't keep running my pharmacy from my savings' Demoralised pharmacists face uncertain future  Nick Kaye, who chairs the NPA, said pharmacies had been \"left with little choice\". \"It is better that we temporarily reduce access in the short term than to let pharmacies collapse altogether under the weight of unsustainable operating costs,\" he said. There had been little feedback from ministers and the impact of the current uncertainty was \"devastating\" for pharmacies, Mr Kaye added. \"We want to get on with seeing patients, pay our staff, not have to think about closing, and invest in our business for the future.\" The Department of Health and Social Care said pharmacies had a vital role to play as the NHS's focus shifted away from hospitals and into the community - and negotiations over a contract were making progress. \"The National Pharmacy Association's pre-emptive action will cause unnecessary disruption for patients and we urge them to reconsider,\" an official said. Healthwatch England, which records the experiences and concerns of people who use health and social-care services, urged the government to conclude negotiations with pharmacies as soon as possible. Benedict Knox, from Healthwatch England, said many patients had seen their local pharmacy close or experience disruptions due to staff shortages.  \"This issue especially impacts older people and is particularly acute in rural areas, where people often have to travel further to visit their pharmacist,\" he said. But he stressed not every community pharmacy was an NPA member and it was up to each one to decide if they would reduce services. There are about 10,500 pharmacies in England, according to Community Pharmacy England, which represents all pharmacy owners.

        "title": "Social care: First cross-party talks on reforms postponed",
        "content": "The first round of cross-party talks on social care in England have been postponed, BBC News has learned. The meeting was due to take place on Wednesday but those due to attend were emailed on Monday evening to say it was off and would be rescheduled. Government sources have pointed to the difficulty of arranging a meeting at which representatives of five different parties can agree to attend at the same time. Conservative sources suggested those being invited ought to have been given more notice about the date and a clearer agenda of what would be talked about in the meeting. Health Secretary Wes Streeting had promised the talks would begin this month and all of the main opposition parties have insisted they want to take part. The Tories, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and the Green Party had been invited by the Department of Health and Social Care to join a discussion later this week involving Baroness Louise Casey. The baroness - who previously led a landmark review of the Metropolitan Police - will chair the independent commission, which is expected to begin work in April. The government has said that the commission would make \"clear recommendations\" for how to rebuild the adult social care system in a way that could achieve cross-party and national support. But critics have previously said the timescale set out by the government lacks sufficient urgency. The commission's work will be split into two phases, with the first due to report back in mid-2026 on critical issues in the system and with some medium-term improvements. However, the second phase - on the broader issues of organising care services and their long-term funding - will not report back until 2028. Last month, Sarah Woolnough - chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that timescale \"feels far too long\". She urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner. Streeting has previously said the government's aim is to set up a \"National Care Service\" that is capable of catering for an ageing population for decades to come. He said the government would \"finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\" but that it \"would take time\" to devise a model fit for the future. Social care covers a broad range of services for people who are older or living with a physical or mental illness. The King's Fund estimates, external local authorities in England spent Â£28.4bn on social care in 2022/23. It also reported 818,000 people received publicly funded long-term social care in 2021/22, with a further 224,000 people receiving short-term care. Meanwhile, campaigners who say the government's changes to national insurance contributions for employers will damage the social care sector were due to hold a demonstration in Westminster on Tuesday.  They say the tax policy - which will see employer contributions increase by 1.2 percentage points and the threshold where levy kicks in slashed by Â£4,100 from April - will leave social care providers \"facing a struggle to survive this spring\". The government has said the changes raise Â£26bn a year and point towards a Â£3.7bn \"funding boost\" for the sector.

        "title": "Denmark's postal service to stop delivering letters",
        "content": "Denmark's letter deliveries began in 1624 Denmark's state-run postal service, PostNord, is to end all letter deliveries at the end of 2025, citing a 90% decline in letter volumes since the start of the century. The decision brings to an end 400 years of the company's letter service. Denmark's 1,500 post boxes will start to disappear from the start of June. Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen sought to reassure Danes, saying letters would still be sent and received as \"there is a free market for both letters and parcels\". Postal services across Europe are grappling with the decline in letter volumes. Germany's Deutsche Post said on Thursday it was axing 8,000 jobs, in what it called a \"socially responsible manner\". Deutsche Post has 187,000 employees and staff representatives said they feared more cuts were to come. Denmark had a universal postal service for 400 years until the end of 2023, but as digital mail services have taken hold, the use of letters has fallen dramatically. PostNord says it will switch its focus to parcel deliveries and that any postage stamps bought this year or in 2024 can be refunded for a limited period in 2026, external. Fifteen hundred workers face losing their jobs, out of a workforce of 4,600. \"It's a super sad day. Not just for our department, but for the 1,500 who face an uncertain future,\" employee Anders Raun Mikkelsen told Danish broadcaster DR. Denmark ranks as one of the world's most digitalised countries.  There's an app for almost everything: few people use cash, and Danes even carry drivers' licences and health cards on their smartphones. Bank statements, bills, and correspondence from local authorities are all sent electronically. Public services send communications via a Digital Post app or other platforms and PostNord Denmark says the letter market is no longer profitable.  Letter numbers have fallen since the start of the century from 1.4 billion to 110 million last year. Letters handled by PostNord (in millions) The decision will affect elderly people most. Although 95% of Danes use the Digital Post service, a reported 271,000 people still rely on physical mail. \"There are many who are very dependent on letters being delivered regularly. These include hospital appointments, vaccinations or decisions regarding home care,\" Marlene Rishoj Cordes, from Aeldre Sagen (DaneAge) told Denmark's TV2. PostNord has weathered years of financial struggles and last year was running a deficit.  Danish MP Pelle Dragsted blamed privatisation for the move and complained the move would disadvantage people living in remote areas. The introduction of a new Postal Act in 2024 opened up the letter market to competition from private firms and mail is no longer exempted from VAT, resulting in higher postage costs. \"When a letter costs 29 Danish krone (Â£3.35; $4.20) there will be fewer letters,\" PostNord Denmark's Managing Director, Kim Pedersen, told local media. He said Danes had become increasingly digital and the decline in letter volumes had become so pronounced that it had fallen by as much as 30% in the past year alone. PostNord also operates in Sweden. It is 40% Danish-owned and 60% Swedish-owned.

        "title": "Sudan military plane crashes in Omdurman killing more than 40",
        "content": "The Wadi Seidna air base is an important hub for the military near Khartoum At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says.  The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction.  The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced.  The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying.  Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports.  The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF.

        "title": "Prostate cancer: Rapid at-home PSA tests spark concerns",
        "content": "At-home tests for men worried about prostate cancer can give inconsistent and inaccurate results, BBC News has found. The tests, which resemble a Covid lateral flow strip, turn positive if a high level of a protein called PSA is detected in a drop of blood. Of five rapid tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative or all-clear, but one returned a false positive result - all from the same blood sample. Prostate Cancer UK said it had significant concerns about the sale of the tests given their \"questionable accuracy\" and the absence of a doctor to interpret the results. There is no national prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. Instead, the onus is on men to request a blood test from their GP once they are over 50 years old, external, or from 45 for higher risk groups. That NHS test, which is processed in a laboratory, measures the level of PSA released by the prostate, a small gland involved in the production of semen. A high PSA level does not mean you have cancer but is a warning sign which can then lead to further scans and tests to rule out the disease. PSA levels can be high for a number of other reasons - including an infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or in some rare cases remain normal despite cancer. Of the five tests analysed by the BBC, one did not work, three were negative but one (left) returned a clear positive result Google search data suggests interest in testing has risen sharply since the Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy went public with his own diagnosis in October 2024. Dozens of companies now sell self-testing kits designed to measure PSA levels. They are available online and from some pharmacies and convenience stores with prices from Â£6 to Â£95. They come in two main types: tests in which a blood sample is taken at home and posted to a private laboratory for analysis rapid tests which give a result in minutes and display a dark line if PSA is detected above a certain level The BBC analysed five rapid tests all bought online from different companies, using a blood sample taken on the same day. The UK medicines regulator, the MHRA, says in its guidance that over-the-counter PSA kits are \"not a reliable indicator of prostate cancer\" and must not \"claim to detect cancer\". Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules. Others are sold to \"monitor prostate health\" or identify \"potential prostate issues early\". One of the home tests ordered by the BBC also arrived in packaging and with instructions clearly marked \"for professional use only\". Charity wants testing of men at high risk of prostate cancer What are the symptoms of prostate cancer? I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy  For someone with no medical experience, the kits can be difficult to use.  A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette. Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l. A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l. \"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK. \"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\" Online reviews appear to bear that out. In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal. In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer. The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\". Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP. Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher, says patients \"may not get the  full picture\" from at-home PSA tests In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history. Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative. \"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds. \"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\" Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\". \"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity. Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing. The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries. Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward. A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year. \"Prostate cancer patients are waiting too long for diagnosis and treatment but through our National Cancer Plan we will transform the way we treat cancer,\" he added.

        "title": "Noise: The invisible killer in all our lives",
        "content": "James Gallagher recording sound levels around Barcelona We are surrounded by an invisible killer. One so common that we barely notice it shortening our lives. It's causing heart attacks, type 2 diabetes and studies now even link it to dementia. What do you think it could be? The answer is noise - and its impact on the human body goes far beyond damaging hearing. \"It is a public health crisis, we've got huge numbers of people exposed in their everyday life,\" says Prof Charlotte Clark, from St George's, University of London. It's just a crisis we don't talk about. So I've been investigating when noise becomes dangerous, chatting to the people whose health is suffering and seeing if there's any way of overcoming our noisy world. I started by meeting Prof Clark in an eerily silent sound laboratory. We're going to see how my body reacts to noise and I've been kitted out with a device that looks like a chunky smartwatch. It's going to measure my heart rate and how much my skin sweats. You can join in too if you have some headphones. Think about how these five sounds make you feel. This video can not be played Listen to five different noises in under a minute: How do they make you feel? The one I find really grating is the traffic noise from Dhaka, Bangladesh, which has the title of the noisiest city in the world. I immediately feel like I'm in a ginormous, stressful traffic jam. And the sensors are picking up my agitation - my heart rate shoots up and my skin is sweating more. \"There's really good evidence that traffic noise affects your heart health,\" says Prof Clark, as the next sound is prepared. Only the joyful sounds of the playground have a calming effect on my body. The dogs barking and the neighbour's party in the early hours lead to a negative response. LISTEN: Is noise an invisible killer? But why is sound changing my body? \"You have an emotional response to sound,\" says Prof Clark. Sound is detected by the ear and passed onto the brain and one region â the amygdala â performs the emotional assessment. This is part of the body's fight-or-flight response that has evolved to help us react quickly to the sounds like a predator crashing through the bushes. \"So your heart rate goes up, your nervous system starts to kick in and you release stress hormones,\" Prof Clark tells me. All of this is good in an emergency, but over time it starts to cause damage. \"If you're exposed for several years, your body's reacting like that all the time, it increases your risk of developing things like heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke and type 2 diabetes,\" says Prof Clark. Insidiously, this even happens while we're fast asleep. You might think you adapt to noise. I thought I did when I lived in a rental near an airport. But the biology tells a different story. \"You never turn your ears off; when you're asleep, you're still listening. So those responses, like your heart rate going up, that's happening whilst you're asleep,\" adds Prof Clark. Coco's health is being damaged by the noise where she lives Noise is unwanted sound. Transport - traffic, trains and aeroplanes â are a major source, but so too are the sounds of us having a good time. One person's great party is another's insufferable noise. I meet Coco at her fourth-floor flat in the historic Vila de GrÃ cia area of Barcelona, Spain. There's a bag of freshly picked lemons tied to her door gifted by one neighbour, her fridge contains a tortilla cooked by another and she offers me fancy cakes made by a third neighbour who's training in patisserie. From the balcony you can see the city's famous basilica, the Sagrada Familia. It is easy to see why Coco has fallen in love with living here, but it comes at a huge price and she thinks she'll be forced to leave. \"It's extremely noisyâ¦ it's 24-hour noise,\" she tells me. There's a dog park for owners to walk their pooches which \"bark at 2, 3, 4, 5am\" and the courtyard is a public space that is used for everything from children's birthday parties to all-day concerts finished off with fireworks. She gets out her phone and plays the recordings of the music being blasted out so loud it makes the glass in her windows vibrate. Her home should be a refuge from the stress of work, but the noise \"brings frustration, I feel like crying\". She has been \"hospitalised twice with chest pain\" and \"absolutely\" thinks noise is causing the stress, which is damaging her health. \"There is a physical change that I feel, it does something to your body, for certain,\" she says. In Barcelona there are an estimated 300 heart attacks and 30 deaths a year just from traffic noise, according to researcher Dr Maria Foraster, who has reviewed evidence on noise for the World Health Organization. Dr Maria Foraster says traffic noise has the biggest impact on health as it is so common Across Europe, external noise is linked to 12,000 early deaths a year as well as millions of cases of severely disturbed sleep as well as serious noise annoyance which can impact mental health. I meet Dr Foraster at a cafÃ© that is separated from one of Barcelona's busiest roads by a small park. My sound meter says the noise from the distant traffic is just over 60 decibels here. We can easily chat over the noise without raising our voices, but this is already an unhealthy volume. The crucial number for heart health is 53 decibels, she tells me, and the higher you go the greater the health risks. \"This 53 means that we need to be in a rather quiet environment,\" says Dr Foraster. And that's just in daytime, we need even lower levels for sleep. \"At night we need quietness,\" she says. Although it is not just about the volume, how disruptive the sound is and how much control you have over it affect our emotional response to noise. Dr Foraster argues the health impact of noise is \"at the level of air pollution\" but is much harder to comprehend. \"We are used to understanding that chemicals can affect health and they are toxic, but it's not so straightforward to understand that a physical factor, like noise, affects our health beyond our hearing,\" she says. A loud party can be the fun that makes life worth living and someone else's intolerable noise. The sound of traffic has the greatest impact on health because so many people are exposed to it. But traffic is also the sound of getting to work, doing the shopping and taking the children to school. Tackling noise means asking people to live their lives differently - which creates problems of its own. Dr Natalie Mueller, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, takes me for a walk around the city centre. We start on a busy road â my sound meter clocks in at over 80 decibels â and we head to a quiet tree-lined avenue where the noise is down to the 50s. Natalie Mueller on a now quiet street that used to flow with traffic But there is something different about this street â it used to be a busy road, but the space was given over to pedestrians, cafes and gardens. I can see the ghost of an old crossroads by the shape of the flowerbeds. Vehicles can still come down here, just slowly. Remember earlier in the lab, we found that some sounds can soothe the body. \"It is not completely silent, but it's a different perception of sound and noise,\" Dr Mueller says.  People walk in a pedestrian area as part of the superblock plan in Barcelona. The initial plan was to create more than 500 areas like this, termed \"superblocks\" - pedestrian-friendly areas created by grouping several city blocks together. Dr Mueller performed the research, external projecting a 5-10% reduction in noise in the city, which would prevent about \"150 premature deaths\" from noise alone each year. And that would be \"just the tip of the iceberg\" of the health benefits. But in reality only six superblocks were ever built. The city council declined to comment. The dangers of noise though are continuing to grow. Urbanisation is putting more people into noisy cities. Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. This has brought more traffic and given the city a cacophonous soundtrack of honking horns. Artist Mominur Rahman Royal earned the label of the \"lone hero\" as his silent protests have focused attention on the city's noise problem. For about 10 minutes each day, he stands at the intersection of a couple of busy roads with a big yellow placard accusing drivers who honk their horns loudly of causing a massive nuisance. Mominur Rahman Royal He took on the mission after his daughter was born. \"I want to stop all honking from not only Dhaka, but from Bangladesh,\" he says. \"If you see the birds or trees or rivers, no one's making noise without humans, so humans are responsible.\" But here there are the beginnings of political action too. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, who's the environment adviser and minister for the government of Bangladesh, told me she was \"very worried\" about the health impacts of noise. There is a crackdown on honking horns to get the noise levels down - with an awareness campaign and stricter enforcement of existing laws. She said: \"It's impossible to get it done in one year or two years, but I think it is possible to ensure that the city becomes less noisy, and when people feel that, they feel better when it's less noisy, I'm sure their habit will also change.\" The solutions to noise can be difficult, complicated and challenging to solve. What I'm left with is a new appreciation for finding some space in our lives to just escape the noise because in the words of Dr Masrur Abdul Quader, from the Bangladesh University of Professionals, it is \"a silent killer and a slow poison\".

        "title": "Lives at risk due to medical scan mistakes, says ombudsman",
        "content": "Repeated failures in how CTs, X-rays and other medical scans are being interpreted are leading to avoidable patient deaths and delays in diagnosing cancer, England's health ombudsman has warned.  The most common problems include doctors failing to spot abnormalities, scans being delayed or not carried out, and results not being followed up properly. The ombudsman has upheld or partially upheld 45 cases which include failures in medical imaging in the last four years, and says lessons must be learned to avoid the same mistakes again.  NHS England said staff work extremely hard to keep patients safe but acknowledged there was more to do to improve the \"response to serious health issues\". In one case, medical staff at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough repeatedly failed to diagnose an 82-year-old man with bowel cancer and left him suffering prolonged pain, according to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman (PHSO). The man, from Buckinghamshire, went to A&E five times between August and October 2021.  A scan taken in August showed a lesion in the bowel. However, clinicians reported no abnormalities, the investigation found, leading to a six-week delay in diagnosis and surgery. The patient also had an X-ray in October that suggested an obstruction in his small bowel, but this X-ray was not reviewed and he was discharged and sent home.  Later that month the cancer was diagnosed and he had an operation to remove part of the bowel. The surgery uncovered another mass elsewhere in his body.  Just months later, the man took his life, leaving a note saying he could no longer deal with the pain.  The ombudsman, Rebecca Hilsenrath KC, said staff failed to manage his pain on five occasions.  Failings in his care \"were probably contributory factors to the patient's decision to end his life\", her report suggests.  The man's daughter said: \"I really tried to get the doctors to listen.  \"I had a feeling something was wrong and I pleaded numerous times for them to keep him in the hospital, but they just kept discharging him and not doing anything to help him.\" A statement provided by the hospital trust says: \"We are very sorry for our failing in care in this case and we have a further meeting with the patient's family shortly to update them on the changes we have since made.  \"This includes ensuring that older patients presenting with abdominal pain are appropriately reviewed.\" The trust has also agreed to pay the family Â£4,000, as recommended by PHSO.  In another investigation, the ombudsman found a cancerous tumour was incorrectly identified as benign (non-cancerous) - despite repeated scans suggesting otherwise.  The patient, a 54-year-old man, had his first scan in Tenerife, after becoming unwell on holiday.  His brother said: \"When my brother collapsed in Tenerife, the hospital immediately identified the tumour for what it was [an aggressive brain tumour] and even offered to remove it.  \"But my brother wanted to come home, he thought the best place for him to have the treatment was in the NHS.\" The man returned to Gillingham, where the local hospital carried out further scans identifying the tumour, and referred him to specialists at King's College Hospital. However, staff there \"downgraded the diagnosis\", saying the tumour was not cancerous. The man was not offered chemotherapy or radiotherapy. He died in hospital, a month after an operation to remove the tumour, which was confirmed to be cancerous. If the cancer had been identified correctly, he could have had surgery months earlier and potentially the option of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PHSO said. While the survival rate for this cancer is poor, the ombudsman's investigation suggests the man may have had a few extra months of life. His brother said: \"I wanted King's College Hospital to acknowledge their mistakes so that I can stop picking at the scab of trying to understand what happened to him and remember my brother as he was when he was alive.\" In a statement, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We fully recognise that errors were made in this patient's care, and we apologised to his family at the time of the incident. \"Learning from mistakes when they occur is crucial, and we have made a number of changes as a result of this case to improve the safety and effectiveness of the care our teams provide.\" The trust has agreed to pay the family Â£3,500.  Ms Hilsenrath, whose team independently investigates complaints, said: \"Each of the cases we have investigated and upheld represent a real person whose life has been impacted by failings in care.  \"They are also all instances where the organisations involved failed to identify that anything had gone wrong\" The 2021 ombudsman report, external into medical imaging issues recommended system-wide improvements, but Ms Hilsenrath said while there had been some progress, she was still seeing instances where people's care was \"sub-optimal, often with devastating consequences\". It is \"critical\" that action is taken to improve the digital infrastructure in the NHS and ensure people are diagnosed and treated swiftly, she added. Dr Katharine Halliday, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, agreed digital infrastructure needed improvements.  \"The ombudsman highlights some devastating failures in the NHS, and we must collectively learn from these experiences to drive meaningful change,\" she said.  \"However, it must also be recognised that these findings reflect a system that is overburdened and under-resourced.\" The college says it faces a 30% shortfall of clinical radiologists, which is projected to rise to 40% by 2028.  An NHS spokesperson said: \"The NHS had delivered a record number of tests and checks in 2024, a fifth more than pre-pandemic but we know there is more to do to improve the recognition and response of serious health issues.\" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our deepest sympathies are with all those who have been affected by the failings highlighted in this shocking report.\" The spokesperson added that they were opening more Community Diagnostic Centres (CDCs), and using new technology like AI so \"all patients can receive world-class care\". Changes were also being introduced in cancer care, the spokesperson said, which would see 100,000 more patients who are referred receiving a diagnosis within four weeks and up to 19,000 more people starting their treatment within two months each year.

        "title": "Most areas in England to cut eating-disorder help for under-18s",
        "content": "Most areas in England are planning cuts to specialist eating-disorder services for children and young people this year, an analysis shows. Of the nation's 42 NHS integrated care boards, 24 are due to reduce spending for under-18s in 2024-25, once inflation is taken into account. Overall spending is due to go up by 2.9%, with budgets rising in the other areas, but the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), which carried out the analysis, said this was too little to cope with increased in demand. NHS England said improving care was \"vital\" and more action was being taken in the community to support young people before their condition became a crisis.  Spending had been increasing for a number of years but \"more work needs to be done\", an official added. Veronika, 20, has been struggling with an eating disorder for five years. \"Shrugged off\" by services in the past, she says cuts could be \"catastrophic\" for people like her. \"It will have a knock-on impact and people won't want to seek help even from their GP, even for physical-health monitoring,\" Veronika says. \"It will just spiral on and on. \"It is horrible living day in and day out with it. \"And if you are not seen quick enough, I know myself how quickly things can spiral in a matter of weeks or days. \"It is going to be tragic for some and just long and horrible for others\".  Eating-disorder services cover a range of different support, from therapy and counselling to crisis support and hospital treatment. But they were already underfunded, the RCPsych said, and it had had to ration care to the under-18s most affected. Last year, referrals went up by 13%. By the end of 2024, more than 6,000 under-18s were on waiting lists. And targets for routine and urgent waits are not currently being met. Dr Ashish Kumar, of the RCPsych, said: \"Eating disorders, in particular anorexia, have high rates of mortality yet are treatable conditions. \"And with the right care and support in a timely manner, most patients can make a full recovery.\" Tom Quinn, of the eating disorder charity Beat, said: \"We are extremely concerned at the prospect of funding cuts to children and young people's eating-disorder services.  \"These vital services are already on their knees.\" It comes after the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Eating Disorders warned \"woefully inadequate care\" meant lives were being lost and families torn apart.

Bath & North East Somerset Council is proposing to build the new schools in the former Culverhay School and Odd Down Sports Ground sites on the southern edge of the city. The plan includes a 120-place school for pupils with special educational needs, and the other is a 55-place alternate provision school. The council said Culverhay Sports Centre will close on 28 June so works could start, after officials deemed it as being at the end of its lifespan. More news stories for Somerset Listen to the latest news for Somerset A brand new gym and fitness spaces will also be built, as well as padel tennis courts and new walking trails around the playing fields. Culverhay Sports Centre has been operational since the 1990s and is only open in the evenings and partially on the weekend. Sports clubs currently using the centre would be offered alternative booking options at other leisure centres in Bath and Kenysham. Councillor Paul May, cabinet member for Children's Services, said the new schools would \"eventually\" provide places for pupils who needed support and would not have to leave the area for education. Barnaby Rich, partnership manager for the council at GLL, which manages the leisure centres in Bath and Keynsham, said the new sports facilities at Odd Down would bring \"significantly enhanced availability throughout the week\". \"Health and fitness members at Culverhay Sports Centre will have access to all our UK centres and can continue their fitness routines at our Bath or Keynsham leisure centres at no extra cost.  \"Additionally, we plan to run some of Culverhay's ongoing classes at Odd Down Sports Ground to reduce the necessity for extra travel.\" Draft plans for Odd Down will be go to public consultation in the spring.

        "title": "Hundreds of thousands will be affected by benefits changes",
        "content": "The work and pensions secretary has set out plans to \"fix the broken benefits system\" and tackle the \"perverse incentives\" driving people to depend on welfare. Liz Kendall's announcement is designed to bring down the spend on sickness and disability benefits â which has massively increased over the last few years and is forecast to hit Â£70bn a year by the end of the decade. The measures are expected to reduce this spending by more than Â£5bn a year by 2029-30. Yet there's something a little odd about the fact we are getting no breakdown of which of these welfare policies will generate the cash saving. The government attributed the lack of numbers to the need for its official independent forecaster the  Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to cast its eyes over them ahead of next week's Spring Statement. The OBR's verdict will matter because there are some uncertainties about how much money will be saved, given for example the significant incentive now existing to claim the most severe disabilities in the Personal Independence Payments (Pips) system. But the government will already have a clear idea of how many people are affected, and by how much. These plans are more geared towards making budgetary numbers add up than fundamental welfare reform. The bottom line is that around a million claimants with a range of less severe problems will lose thousands of pounds from next November.  It reflects the argument that spending on Pip benefits is \"unsustainable\" and puts the whole welfare system at risk. While in the Universal Credit savings, much of the impact is generated by changes for future claimants, raising the eligibility age to 22 and halving the health payment, this is not the case for Pips. Live: Follow the latest on benefits changes At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up What are the benefits changes and who will be affected? Pip payments are determined by a questionnaire about your daily life, such as your ability to prepare and eat food, wash and get dressed or communicating and reading. Each are scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional. Your payment depends on the total score across all areas. The proposed change is that people will need to score at least four on one item, indicating a more severe disability in one area.  Whereas currently claimants can qualify for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of activities. For example, needing an aid or appliance to speak or hear counts as two points, while needing support to express or understand complex verbal information counts as four points. And needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points. The changes announced aim to take Pip payments away from such people from November 2026.  The government knows how many, and who they are. For now, until the Spring Statement next week, we can deduce that there are around a million people who will lose their entire Â£70 a week or Â£3,500 a year payment. It is a down payment on welfare reform, and a much bigger up front scorable spending cut to help the chancellor's numbers, and so avoid tax rises or missing her non-negotiable borrowing limits.

Danan died in January at the age of 46. The inquest was opened and adjourned on Tuesday at Avon Coroner's Court, with senior coroner Maria Voisin setting a provisional date of 28 May for the actor's full inquest hearing. Danan, who played Sol Patrick in Hollyoaks, was also known for his appearances on the likes of  Celebrity Love Island and Celebrity Big Brother. Coroner's officer Alexis Camp told the hearing that Danan was pronounced dead at his home in Brislington, Bristol, at 5.20pm on 15 January. His body was identified at the scene by his partner, Melissa Crooks. Ms Camp said: \"The circumstances are that Mr Danan was found unresponsive at his home address. \"Emergency services attended and confirmed he had sadly died. A post-mortem has taken place and samples have been removed for further analysis.\" The court was told that the provisional cause of Danan's death is combined toxicity of heroin, methadone, codeine, pregabalin, cocaine, zopiclone, contributed to by benzodiazepine use. Ms Camp said: \"I understand there are no family concerns,\" adding that \"no note was left\" by the star. Statements will be taken from Danan's GP, family, police, the ambulance service and inquiries are ongoing with Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (AWP), she said.  Danan had been due to appear for a plea hearing at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 16 January after being charged with being in possession of cocaine and cannabis, according to court documents. He was also accused of driving whilst under the influence of drugs on 2 October last year, in Warrington, Cheshire. Danan had openly discussed previous issues with drugs, including addictions to cocaine and codeine, which he said he used to \"self-soothe\" after losing acting parts in his 20s while in the US. He also said that he had spent more than Â£1m on rehab over the years. In 2020, Danan launched drama classes in Bristol, his adopted home, for adults with mental health or addiction issues, or who have been through trauma or been in prison. Speaking at the time of his death, the actor's management company said he was \"known for his television presence, exceptional talent and unwavering kindness\", and had been \"a beacon of light to so many\".

Baloo was given The Kennel Club Hero Dog Award after almost 120,000 votes were cast by the public. The Belgian Malinois had to have one of her legs amputated after being hit by a suspect's car fleeing a crime scene in 2018. Her story later inspired the launch of an animal trauma support service for police officers. Baloo and owner Mandy Chapman visit schools, care homes and community groups to help with mental health issues. \"She is an amazing dog through and through,\" Ms Chapman said. \"Despite her disability and the terrible injuries she sustained, she has come through it all so well and finds joy in life, as well as giving joy in life, every single day.\" Ms Chapman described how the eight-year-old dog would often \"fix on\" a particular person, such as a school pupil, who she would later find out had recently been experiencing a \"terrible time\". \"She's only got one paw, but she gives it to people and looks deep into their eyes - it's amazing.\" The award was announced at the bp pulse LIVE arena, at the NEC in Birmingham, on the final day of Crufts, by campaigner Josephine Hamilton OBE and paralympian Ellie Simmonds OBE. The pair were presented with their award and a cheque for Â£5,000 for their dog charity of choice â Essex Retired Police Dog Fund. Baloo had her leg amputated after being injured on duty for Essex Police Baloo received surgery at Dick White Referrals in Newmarket, Suffolk, and has had hydrotherapy and other treatments at Anglia Ruskin University's Writtle campus near Chelmfsord. Ms Chapman said this had made her strong: \"Up until recently she was doing canine cross running in Essex and she'd be the first dog to finish, even though she'd be put at the back of the race.\" Baloo broke her pelvis and leg when she was hit by the car  The pair worked with the College of Policing team to set up Oscar Kilo wellbeing and trauma support service. Now there are more than 250 canines involved with the scheme. \"She proves that however hard things get, you can get through it. She is super soppy and sharing her is so rewarding, I love every second of it,\" added Ms Chapman. \"Thank you to each and every person who has voted for her [for the award].\" Helen Kerfoot, Crufts show manager, said: \"What Baloo has achieved, the courage she has shown, and the support she now gives others is extraordinary. \"Mandy and Baloo's incredible bond and the work they do together is inspiring.\" Do you have a story suggestion for Essex?

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Moment Pope greets cheering crowds from hospital window Pope Francis has appeared at his window of the Gemelli hospital in Rome and offered a blessing for the first time since being admitted on 14 February. The 88-year-old pontiff was discharged minutes later and doctors say he will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican. During the past five weeks, he presented \"two very critical episodes\" where his \"life was in danger\", Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said. Pope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said. Even though the Pope is not completely healed, he no longer has pneumonia and will return to work as soon as possible, if the trend continues, doctors say. Mayor of Rome Roberto Gualtieri told the BBC he felt \"a really great joy, great emotion to see Pope Francis leaving the hospital\".  \"It's a great gift to the city and to the world... we support him and feel really close to him,\" the mayor said. Crowds gathered outside the Gemelli hospital in Rome to see the Pope A crowd of people gathered outside the hospital on Sunday, waiting for the Pope to appear. \"When I saw him I felt, to be honest, a little relieved,\" said Bishop Larry Kulick, from the Diocese of Greensburg in the US state of Pennsylvania. \"I felt just overjoyed to see him.\"  \"I cried all the time because the love we breathe in this little square of this hospital was like heaven,\" said Ilaria Della Bidia, a singer from Rome.  Ana Matos from Brazil said she \"just arrived from Brazil today\" and arrived outside the hospital \"30 seconds before he appeared\". She said that \"it was an amazing feeling, like when I had my son. I was so happy to see him healthy and I could see him smile\".  The Pope had only previously been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel. Earlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis was played in St Peter's Square in Vatican City. His voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.

        "title": "Texas cops arrest midwife for allegedly providing abortions",
        "content": "Texas attorney general Ken Paxton announced the arrest on Monday. It is believed to be one of the first criminal cases under the state's near-total abortion ban A midwife in Texas has been arrested for allegedly providing illegal abortions and operating a network of unlawful clinics in the Houston area. Maria Margarita Rojas has been charged with providing an abortion and practising medicine without a licence, according to the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Authorities accused Ms Rojas, 48, of operating multiple clinics in Houston where she allegedly performed illegal abortions in her clinic, violating the state's restrictive abortion laws. Ms Rojas faces second-degree felony charges, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $10,000 (Â£7,700) if convicted. Under the Texas Human Life Protection Act - a 2021 law that bans abortion in most cases - state authorities can also fine Ms Rojas at least $100,000 \"per violation\". In a news release on Monday announcing the arrest, Attorney General Paxton said that \"Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable\". \"I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said. He added that Texas law holds abortion providers, not patients, \"criminally responsible\" for unlawful procedures. In Texas, physicians are barred from performing an abortion once a foetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks into a pregnancy - before many realise they are pregnant. There are exceptions if the life or health of the pregnant patient is at risk, but not in cases of rape or incest. The state's supreme court unanimously rejected a challenge last year from 20 women who said they were denied medically necessary abortions under Texas law. Paxton's office said Ms Rojas, who they allege is known as \"Dr Maria\", operated multiple clinics in north-west Houston. She employed \"unlicensed individuals\" and performed \"illegal abortion procedures\", according to the allegations.  Authorities said they have filed a temporary restraining order to shut down the clinics. Holly Shearman, a midwife who runs a birth centre where Ms Rojas worked part-time, told the Texas Tribune that she was \"shocked\" by news of the arrest. According to the Texas-based news website, Ms Shearman said Ms Rojas was a devout Catholic who provided prenatal care to a primarily Spanish-speaking, low-income community.  \"I don't believe it for one second,\" she said of the allegations. Ms Rojas' arrest is believed to be one of the first criminal prosecutions under the Texas abortion ban. The state attorney general's office said she was taken into custody in Waller County, and it is unclear if she has a lawyer yet. Last year, Paxton's office filed a lawsuit against a New York-based abortion provider for allegedly posting abortion pills to a Texan. That same doctor was indicted earlier this year in the state on a charge of criminal abortion.   New York has shield laws, which aim to protect providers who provide abortion to patients in other states. New York Gov Kathy Hochul has said the state has no plans to allow for Dr Margaret Daley Carpenter's extradition to Texas.  She called the case \"outrageous\" and said Republicans were trying to stymie access to abortion across the US.

        "title": "Schools asked to supervise toothbrushing for young children",
        "content": "School and nursery staff in the most deprived areas of England will be asked to supervise young children while they brush their teeth, under a national toothbrushing programme. Schemes are already running in some schools - but now dedicated central funding will reach the poorest areas where children are most at risk of tooth decay, the government says. Dental experts said the move would \"save children from pain and the NHS a fortune\". But the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) union said caution was needed to avoid shifting \"what is ultimately a parental responsibility on to the burden on schools\". National supervised toothbrushing programmes have been running in Scotland since 2006 and Wales since 2009. And in Northern Ireland, some nursery staff have been supervising toothbrushing since 2016, in a funded programme targeting the poorest 20% of areas. Teachers and other staff demonstrate and help, without directly brushing the children's teeth, at some point during the school day.  The idea, external, according to experts, is not to replace toothbrushing at home but to help build skills, good habits and confidence.  But in England, provision is patchy, external, partly because of logistical problems but also a lack of staff and dedicated funding. About one out of every four, external five-year-olds in England has had tooth decay - and in poorer areas, it is one in three. Tooth decay is the most common reason five-to-nine-year-olds in England are admitted to hospital.  And in many areas, access to an NHS dentist has become increasingly difficult. Abbie says her daughter used to be quite \"toothbrush shy\" Abbie's daughter goes to a nursery in Bridlington where toothbrushing lessons already take place.  She says her toddler was quite \"toothbrush shy\" but the scheme has helped. \"When we first started toothbrushing she refused to do it at home â it was a two person job. \"I think in nursery it is different, it is quite an event. They all do it together - it is quite social, they sing a song,\" she told the BBC.  Bridlington only has one NHS dentist practice accepting patients. Her children and husband have had to register in a different town.  Health Minister Stephen Kinnock said focusing on prevention would help give children the best start in life. \"It is shocking that a third of five-year-olds in the most deprived areas have experience of tooth decay - something we know can have a lifelong impact on their health,\" he said. \"It's why we're delivering supervised toothbrushing to young children and families who are most in need of support, as part of our wider plans to revive the oral health of the nation.\" The government says it is also working to reform the dental contract, so dentists take on more NHS work.  Children wait over year in pain for NHS tooth removal 'Some six-year-olds have never seen a toothbrush' From April, local authorities will be given Â£11m funding and asked to identify schools and nurseries most in need.  The aim is to reach about 600,000 three-to-five-year-olds a year.  For every Â£1 spent on the scheme, Â£3 in treatment costs will be avoided â adding up to more than Â£34m over the next five years, the government says. Some children will use the 23 million toothbrushes and toothpastes donated by Colgate to the programme.   The British Dental Association welcomed the move but said more needed to be done to tackle food marketing and labelling.   Eddie Crouch, who chairs the association, said: \"Supervised toothbrushing is tried and tested policy that will save children from pain and our NHS a fortune. \"The only concern is why it's taken a century to get here.\" Paul Whiteman, of the NAHT, agreed there was a crisis in children's dental health and the government was right to prioritise it. \"However, we cannot keep loading increasing expectations on schools,\" he said. \"Nor can we keep looking to schools to fix all of society's ills.  \"Most people would see toothbrushing as a basic part of parenting and we must be careful not to shift what is ultimately a parental responsibility on to the shoulders of schools.\" Mr Whiteman urged the government to find other ways to support parents and focus on \"rebuilding NHS dentistry\". Dr Katie Dalrymple, lecturer in nutritional sciences, at King's College London, said the initiative would have a positive impact - but to truly protect children, the focus must be on reducing exposure to high-sugar foods and drinks. The government is also expanding water fluoridation across north-east England, following a public consultation.  You can start brushing as soon as teeth come through Use fluoride toothpaste - a pea-sized amount for three-to-six-year-olds Making a game of it or brushing your teeth at the same time can help  Spit out toothpaste after but do not rinse with water, which can wash away the fluoride  Help children brush their teeth until they are confident and doing it well, around the age of seven  Source: NHS, external Showing your toddler how to brush their teeth Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "title": "Treasury earmarks billions in spending cuts ahead of Spring Statement",
        "content": "The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement. The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out. Sources said \"the world has changed\" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had Â£9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules. The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK. The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its \"major measures\" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money. The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending. Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\". The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March. Analysis: Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs.  \"Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes,\" a government insider told the BBC. \"The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.\" Insiders expect \"politically painful\" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a \"huge rise in the welfare budget\" and there were \"too many\" young people not in work, education or training. \"There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,\" she added. Reeves has previously pledged \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits. Last year, the government spent Â£65bn on sickness benefits, external - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around Â£100bn before the next general election. Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourage some to \"game the system\".  People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work. Steve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts \"would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable\". Reeves's proposed cuts will trigger big political arguments The seven bills due to go up in April What is the OBR and why does it matter? The chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to \"fix welfare to get people back to work\" and \"make the NHS more productive\". \"Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks,\" an insider told the BBC. This week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China.  Trump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves has told the BBC that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation. Uncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid. In the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings. It is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast. But there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy.  Inflation, which measures the rate of price rises over time, is expected to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills.

        "title": "Pope Francis asks for prayers in message from hospital",
        "content": "Pope Francis has asked Catholics to pray for him, as he continues to receive treatment in hospital for double pneumonia. The pontiff was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second Sunday running. But in a message written over the last few days, he said he was \"confidently continuing\" his hospitalisation at Rome's Gemelli Hospital and \"carrying on with the necessary treatment\". The message comes after the Vatican revealed on Saturday that the 88-year-old's condition continues to be \"critical\". In his message, released on Sunday, the Pope thanked the doctors and health workers at the hospital, and well-wishers who sent in messages. \"In recent days I have received many messages of affection, and I have been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children,\" he wrote. \"Thank you for this closeness, and for the prayers of comfort I have received from all over the world! I entrust you all to the intercession of Mary, and I ask you to pray for me.\" Well-wishers have continued to pray outside the hospital. Dozens of people have been seen lighting candles and leaving them at the foot of a nearby statue of the late Pope John Paul II. The 88-year-old was first admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing difficulties breathing for several days. He is especially prone to lung infections due to developing pleurisy - an inflammation around the lungs - as an adult and having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. During his 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic church, the Argentine has been admitted to hospital several times, including in March 2023 when he spent three nights in hospital with bronchitis. Well-wishers continue to gather and pray outside the hospital where the Pope is receiving treatment The Pope has asked for openness about his health, so the Vatican has started to release daily statements. The tone and length of the announcements has varied, sometimes leaving Pope-watchers to attempt to read between the lines. On Saturday, the Vatican said the Roman Catholic leader was alert and spent the day in an armchair, but that he was \"not out of danger\" and that he was \"more unwell\" than he was on Friday. They added the pontiff needed blood transfusions due to a low platelet count - associated with anaemia - and he required a \"high flow\" of oxygen. Doctors treating the Pope confirmed this week that he was responding to medication but his condition was complex and the slightest change of circumstance would upset what was called a \"delicate balance\". \"He is the Pope,\" as one of them put it. \"But he is also a man.\" The Pope also used his message on Sunday to highlight the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine on Monday, and called on people to remember all victims of armed conflict and to \"pray for the gift of peace in Palestine, Israel and throughout the Middle East, Myanmar, Kivu and Sudan\". The Angelus prayer is usually delivered by the Pope from a window of the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican and is accompanied by a short message.

        "title": "Trump pulls $400 million from Columbia University over Gaza protests",
        "content": "Thousands of students protested against Israel's war in Gaza at Columbia University  The Trump administration is immediately pulling $400m (Â£310m) of federal funding from Columbia University, saying it failed to fight antisemitism on campus.  A statement by four federal agencies said the funding cut was due to \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students\". The New York college was the epicentre of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses last year against war in Gaza and US support for Israel.  Earlier this week, President Trump had threatened to pull funding from schools and universities that allow \"illegal protests\".  Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in Friday's statement that Jewish students on campus who had been the victims of \"relentless violence, intimidation, and antisemitic harassment on their campuses\" were \"ignored\" by university authorities. \"Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer,\" she said. A spokesman for Columbia told the BBC that the university is reviewing the announcement, and pledged to work with the government to restore its federal funding. \"We take Columbia's legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,\" she said. Columbia is one of the most prestigious universities in the US and has about 30,000 students. Its famous Morningside Heights campus is on the west side of Manhattan. Last year, the Ivy League university saw some of the largest and most tense campus demonstrations in the US as students protested against Israel's military operation in Gaza.  The Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage. Some 48,440 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  A ceasefire deal was reached in January, but looks increasingly fragile after the first phase expired recently. A campus-wide email sent out by Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong on Friday described a \"time of great risk to our university\", according to the New York Times. \"There is no question that the cancellation of these funds will immediately impact research and other critical functions of the University, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care,\" she wrote. In the 2024 fiscal year, federal funding accounted for $1.3bn of the university's annual operating revenue, according to the Columbia Daily Spectator, external student newspaper. The decision to pull aid from Columbia was criticised by New York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman, who called it an illegal move \"to coerce colleges and universities into censoring student speech and advocacy that isn't Maga-approved, like criticising Israel or supporting Palestinian rights\". Last April, the pro-Palestinian protesters took over a building on campus known as Hamilton Hall, renaming it 'Hind's Hall' - in honour of a five-year-old girl, Hind Rajab, who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in January 2024. The protests led to the resignation of Columbia University President Minouche Shafik in August, making her the third president of an Ivy League university to step down over their handling of Gaza war protests. One student member of a Jewish campus group told the Associated Press news agency that he welcomed the move to punish Columbia.  Brian Cohen said he hoped it would be \"a wake-up call to Columbia's administration and trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously\". Pro-Palestinian demonstrators continued protesting at Columbia recently. On Friday, the university confirmed that four students were arrested for a \"disruption\" on Wednesday at Barnard College - a separate institution affiliated to Columbia - adding they had been \"suspended and restricted from campus\".

        "title": "Doctors back total ban on smacking children in England",
        "content": "Leading child doctors have joined calls for a complete ban on smacking children in England, saying there is no evidence it has any positive effect on their wellbeing. Currently, smacking is unlawful in England, except in cases where it amounts to a \"reasonable punishment\". Now the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) wants that legal defence to be removed, using an amendment to a law which is currently making its way through Parliament. The Department for Education said the government had no plans to change the law on smacking, but that it was committed to giving every child the best start in life. Prof Andrew Rowland, RCPCH officer for child protection, said: \"Now is the time for this Victorian-era punishment to go.\" If enough MPs backed the amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, tabled by Labour MP Jess Asato in January, then the defence of smacking as a \"reasonable punishment\" would be completely outlawed in England. Currently, the situation on smacking children is different depending on where you are in the UK. In Scotland and Wales, corporal - or physical - punishment is illegal, but in England and Northern Ireland the \"reasonable punishment\" defence still stands. In England, the defence is included in the Children Act of 2004, but smacking children has been permitted by law since 1860. Scotland was the first UK country to ban corporal punishment in November 2020, followed by Wales in March 2022. Prof Rowland said there were 67 countries around the world which had already adopted smacking bans, with a further 20 committing to do so. The government said it was \"looking closely\" at the changes made in Scotland and Wales, but had no plans to legislate on smacking at this stage. A spokesperson said the bill in its current form represented the \"single biggest piece of child protection legislation in a generation\".  \"This government has prioritised significant reform of the children's social care system, driving better child protection and information sharing between education, health and social workers to stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks,\" they added. Parents at a baby sensory group in Sale, Greater Manchester, told the BBC they were all against smacking children, but some were unsure about whether it was right for the government to intervene. Mum Leanne Casey, said parents \"should be able to discipline how they see fit\", but added: \"I don't agree with smacking children though, so if a ban is what it takes then I'd agree that is what you need to do.\" Dad Oli Harrison said he would \"never intervene\" in another person's parenting methods, but added that a ban would \"probably be beneficial\" to avoid it being seen as a \"grey area\". Oli Harrison, pictured with his daughter Lily, said \"some kind of legislation\" would help provide clarity for parents When looking at populations as a whole, Prof Rowland said physical punishment \"undoubtedly harms children's health\". He said there were no scientific studies which provided robust evidence that smacking had any positive effect on children's wellbeing. Calls for a ban on smacking intensified after the death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif. Sara was murdered in August 2023 after a \"campaign of torture\" by her father and stepmother which lasted for two years. Her father, who had fled to Pakistan after the murder, had phoned police in England claiming he had \"legally punished\" Sara before her death. It is unlawful in England to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm, or cruelty, but Prof Rowland said academic studies had shown children who were punished physically were at an increased risk of serious physical assault. He said a complete ban on smacking would make it easier for the authorities to \"draw a line and say there are never any circumstances involved where physical punishment of children is ever legal\". Other organisations, including the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, have also backed the amendment. Joanna Barrett, from the charity, said smacking had been associated with \"depression, anxiety, increased aggression, and antisocial behaviour\". She said a legal change was needed \"urgently\", adding that \"right now we know physical punishment remains a part of childhood for too many young people in England\". Not everyone agrees. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell on Thursday, Simon Calvert from campaign group Be Reasonable challenged the doctors' calls. He argued that unreasonable chastisement, such as beating a child, was already illegal, and voiced concerns the proposal could mean \"a mum tapping a tot on the back of the hand\" faces criminal prosecution.

        "title": "New endometriosis pill approved on NHS in England",
        "content": "The first daily pill for treating endometriosis symptoms has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales - but only for patients who have tried all other options. Endometriosis affects 1.5 million women in the UK, causing pain and extreme tiredness as a result of tissue similar to the womb lining growing elsewhere in the body. The new tablet, known as relugolix combination therapy, has been approved by drug assessment body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and, unlike current injectable treatments, it can be taken at home. The charity Endometriosis UK said the pill gives patients more choice, but will help only a relatively small number of people. severe period pain that stops you from doing normal activities very heavy periods pain when you poo or pee other symptoms can include pain in your lower tummy, pain after sex, fatigue, shortness of breath, low mood, anxiety difficulty getting pregnant  The new combination therapy pill will cost Â£72 for a 28-day supply, NICE said.  It works by blocking specific hormones that contribute to the condition, while also providing replacement hormones that are needed. It will only be available on the NHS for people who have already tried all other medical and surgical treatments and found they did not help, NICE said - equivalent to 1,000 women a year. This includes treatments such as hormonal contraceptives and intrauterine delivery systems. Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said it marked \"a potential step-change in how we manage endometriosis, putting control back in patients' hands while ensuring value for the taxpayer\". She said the treatment could be stopped and started more easily than other treatments, which is important for those planning to have children and for managing side effects.  That could also reduce pressure on NHS services, she added. NICE initially rejected the drug, but new evidence was provided by the manufacturer on its effectiveness and value for money. Ami posts about her life with endometriosis on social media as \"positivami\" Ami Clarke, 27, from St. Albans, started experiencing endometriosis symptoms after her very first period, aged 13. She was not diagnosed until 10 years later - by then she had tried six different contraceptive pills to find a way of helping her pain, but nothing seemed to work. \"I came off the pill and that's when my periods became absolutely, completely unmanageable. They took over my life. I wasn't going to university, I wasn't going to work,\" Ami says. \"If I was going to work, I was collapsing in pain consistently every single month.\" Ami kept going back to her GP because the pain was \"completely unbearable\". \"I was just so desperate, my mental health was on the floor. I don't even know how I survived. It was like 20 to 25 days out of the month where I was just completely bed-bound,\" she told the BBC. Ami had her first surgery in October 2021, which reduced the pain for seven or eight months, but then it gradually came back. A second operation in April 2024  was not as successful. She is now trying to raise enough money to have a third surgery, privately. Ami says it is good to hear that further treatment is being developed for endometriosis because \"a lot of the time it feels like you're being left in the dark\". Usually, the first treatments for endometriosis, after pain relievers, are hormone injections which temporarily shut down the body's production of estrogen. This is the hormone that causes endometriosis tissue to grow and cause pain. However, patients often need to travel to hospitals to have the injections, which last for up to three months.  With the new all-in-one tablet, there is no need for patients to remember to take hormone replacement therapy as a separate tablet.  It can be stopped quickly if side effects are difficult and taken up until the menopause. \"It's a step forward and will give patients more choice, but it will impact a relatively small number of people,\" says Emma Cox, chief executive of Endometriosis UK. \"We need to see more investment in other research and treatments,\" she added.

        "title": "Greenpeace ordered to pay hundreds of millions in damages to oil firm",
        "content": "The Water is Life protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline drew thousands of supporters at their peak A North Dakota jury has found Greenpeace liable for defamation, ordering it to pay more than $660m (Â£507m) in damages to an oil company for the environmental group's role in one of the largest anti-fossil fuel protests in US history. Texas-based Energy Transfer also accused Greenpeace of trespass, nuisance and civil conspiracy over the demonstrations nearly a decade ago against the Dakota Access Pipeline. The lawsuit, filed in state court, argued that Greenpeace was behind an \"unlawful and violent scheme to cause financial harm to Energy Transfer\".  Greenpeace, which vowed to appeal, said last month it could be forced into bankruptcy because of the case, ending over 50 years of activism. Protests against the pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation drew thousands, but Greenpeace argued it did not lead the demonstration and that the lawsuit threatened free speech. Instead, it said the protests were led by local indigenous leaders who were opposed to the pipeline. The nine-person jury reached a verdict on Wednesday after about two days of deliberating.  The case was heard at a court in Mandan, about 100 miles (160km) north of where the protests took place. Trey Cox, a lawyer for Energy Transfer, said during closing arguments that Greenpeace's actions caused between $265m to $340m in damages. He asked the jury to award the company that amount, plus additional damages.  Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline gained international attention during President Donald Trump's first term, as Native American groups set up an encampment trying to block it from passing near Standing Rock. The protests, which saw acts of violence and vandalism, started in April 2016 and ended in February 2017, when the National Guard and police cleared away the demonstrators.  At the peak, over 10,000 protesters were on site. The group included more than 200 Native American tribes, hundreds of US military veterans, actors and political leaders - including current US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr. The 1,172-mile pipeline has been operating since 2017. However, it still lacks a key permit to operate under Lake Oahe in South Dakota, and local tribes have pushed for an extensive environmental review of the project.  During the three-week trial, jurors heard from Energy Transfer's co-founder and board chairman Kelcy Warren, who said in a video deposition that protesters had created \"a total false narrative\" about his company. \"It was time to fight back,\" he said. Energy Transfer's lawyer Mr Cox told the court that Greenpeace had exploited the Dakota Access Pipeline to \"promote its own selfish agenda\". Attorneys for Greenpeace argued that the group did not lead the protests, but merely helped support \"nonviolent, direct-action training\". In response to the verdict, Greenpeace International's general counsel Kristin Casper said \"Energy Transfer hasn't heard the last of us in this fight\". \"We will not back down, we will not be silenced,\" she said.  Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said he believes \"the verdict's magnitude will have a chilling effect on environmental and other public interest litigation\".  \"It may encourage litigants in other states to file similar lawsuits,\" he told the BBC.  Energy Transfer's legal action named Greenpeace USA, as well as its Washington DC-based funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc and its Amsterdam-based parent group Greenpeace International. Greenpeace has counter-sued Energy Transfer in Dutch court, claiming the oil firm is attempting to unfairly use the legal system to silence critics. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, seeks to recover all damages and costs.

        "title": "GPs in England strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments",
        "content": "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said. The deal gives an extra Â£889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients. The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.  The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices. However, doctors also want the government to commit to talks about a completely new national contract for GPs within this parliament. GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under. Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments. Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment. Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am. It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up. Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.  The new contractÂ says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need. The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%. The total figure includes almost Â£800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients. Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff. GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations. Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\". \"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.  \"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment. \"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra Â£889m next year.  \"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\" Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed. \"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning â what we now need is certainty about our collective future. \"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\" Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.  She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.  She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".  Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.  Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\" But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added. Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.  \"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added. Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.  \"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.  \"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.  \"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\" Tell us your experience accessing GP appointments.

        "title": "Gaza war: UN experts accuse Israel of 'genocidal acts' and sexual violence",
        "content": "The commission of inquiry alleges that Israeli forces intentionally attacked the al-Basma IVF clinic in Gaza City UN experts have accused Israel of increasingly using sexual and gender-based violence against Palestinians and carrying out \"genocidal acts\" through the systematic destruction of maternal and reproductive healthcare facilities. A report commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council documents alleged violations, including rape, in Gaza and the occupied West Bank since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war. It also says the destruction of maternity wards in Gaza and embryos at a fertility clinic could indicate a strategy to prevent births among a particular group - one of the legal definitions of genocide. Israel said it \"categorically rejects the unfounded allegations\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded angrily, calling the Human Rights Council \"an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body\". Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said, it was attacking Israel with \"false accusations\". Blindfolded, bound and beaten: Palestinians tell of Israeli jail abuse Israel, Hamas accused of war crimes in new UN report UN finds 'convincing information' of sexual violence against hostages Warning: This article contains distressing content The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The three-member commission said its new report, external was based on testimony from victims and witnesses of sexual and reproductive violence, some of whom spoke during two days of public hearings held in Geneva earlier this week, as well as verified photos and video footage, and information from civil society and women's rights organisations. The commission's chair Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief, said the evidence collected \"reveals a deplorable increase in sexual and gender-based violence\" that she claimed was being employed by Israel against Palestinians \"to terrorise them and perpetuate a system of oppression that undermines their right to self-determination\". The report says specific forms of sexual and gender-based violence - such as forced public stripping and nudity, sexual harassment including threats of rape, as well as sexual assault - \"comprise part of the Israeli Security Forces' standard operating procedures toward Palestinians\". Other forms of such violence, including rape and violence to the genitals, were \"committed either under explicit orders or with implicit encouragement by Israel's top civilian and military leadership\", it alleges. The report does not provide examples of explicit orders from commanders or senior officials. But it does cite statements from Israeli ministers who defended soldiers who were accused of severely mistreating a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman military base last year. Commission member Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, told the BBC: \"Sexual violence is now so widespread that it can only be considered systematic. It's got beyond the level of random acts by rogue individuals.\" Israel has rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of Gaza detainees, and insisted it is fully committed to international legal standards. The commission of inquiry says it reviewed footage showing Palestinians who were forced to strip after being detained by Israeli forces The report says the commission also found that Israeli forces had systematically destroyed sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities across Gaza during the 17-month war there. It concludes that women and girls have died from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth due to conditions imposed by the Israeli authorities which have denied access to reproductive health care, and says they amount to the crime against humanity of extermination. The commission also alleges that Israeli authorities have \"destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of Palestinians in Gaza as a group\" through the \"systematic destruction\" of sexual and reproductive healthcare facilities, including maternity hospitals and maternity wards of hospitals and Gaza's main in-vitro fertility clinic, Al-Basma IVF Centre in Gaza City. This amounts to \"two categories of genocidal acts in the Rome Statute and the Genocide Convention, including deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians and imposing measures intended to prevent births\", it concludes. According to the report, the embryology laboratory at Al-Basma was hit in early December 2023, reportedly destroying around 4,000 embryos as well as 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs. It says the commission determined through visual analysis of pictures that the damage was caused by a large calibre projectile, most probably an Israeli tank shell, and that it was intentionally attacked by Israeli forces. However, the Israeli military told ABC News at the time that it was not aware of a strike on the clinic. The BBC has contacted the IDF for comment. \"The deliberate destruction of a health facility is one serious issue for international humanitarian law and human rights law. But it does appear from our analysis of the attack on this clinic, that it was knowingly and intentionally directed towards the destruction of reproductive services,\" Mr Sidoti said. \"The consequence of this is the prevention of births.\" In a statement, external, Israel's mission to the UN in Geneva said the report was \"a shameless attempt to incriminate the [Israel Defense Forces] and manufacture the illusion of 'systemic' use of [sexual and gender-based violence]\". It criticised what it called the commission's decision to use \"information from second-hand single uncorroborated sources\", which it said was inconsistent with established UN standards and methodologies. The statement also stressed that the IDF had \"concrete directives, procedures, orders, and policies, which unequivocally prohibit such misconduct\", as well as mechanisms to investigate any incidents of alleged sexual violence. Israel's prime minister also rejected the report's findings and called the Human Rights Council an \"anti-Israel circus\". \"Instead of focusing on the crimes against humanity and the war crimes that were perpetrated by the Hamas terrorist organisation in the worst massacre carried out against the Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN has again chosen to attack the State of Israel with false accusations, including baseless accusations of sexual violence,\" Netanyahu said. Israeli soldier jailed for abusing Palestinian detainees from Gaza Israeli protesters enter army base after soldiers held over Gaza detainee abuse The UN experts determined there were \"reasonable grounds to conclude\" the allegations were committed, and that \"such systematic attacks were intentional\", Fernando Travesi of the International Center for Transitional Justice told the BBC. He said they reached that conclusion by analysing digital content and hearing victim and witness statements, and he sees no reason to question whether they had sufficient evidence. But the commission of inquiry applies a different threshold of evidence to a court of law, and to establish criminal liability for genocide the conclusions would need to be confirmed in court \"beyond any reasonable doubt\", Mr Travesi said. The International Court of Justice is hearing a case bought by South Africa that accuses Israeli forces of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel has vehemently denied the allegation. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,520 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has also been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.

        "title": "Israel says it is conducting 'extensive strikes' on the Gaza Strip",
        "content": "This video can not be played Explosions seen over Gaza as Israeli military launches new strikes against Hamas The Israeli military says it is carrying out \"extensive strikes\" in the Gaza Strip, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting more than 400 Palestinians have been killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was attacking what it called \"terror targets\" belonging to Hamas. The strikes are continuing and the IDF has issued fresh evacuation orders for many areas. Mahmoud Abu Wafah, deputy interior minister in Gaza and the territory's highest-ranking Hamas security official, is among the dead. Four other senior officials were later reported killed. This is the largest wave of air strikes in Gaza since the ceasefire began on 19 January.  Talks to extend it have failed to reach an agreement. Israeli military announces \"extensive\" strikes on targets in Gaza - follow live  Many people were having their pre-dawn meal, part of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when explosions started in Gaza, witnesses say. They described a nightmarish situation, with fires and bodies everywhere, and wounded people desperate for treatment. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered  the strikes on Tuesday morning, a statement from the prime minister's office said. \"This follows Hamas's repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals it has received from US Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff and from the mediators.\"  \"Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,\" it added. Israel says Hamas is still holding 59 hostages - all but one who were taken on 7 October 2023. Twenty-four of the hostages are believed to still be alive. Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, warned Hamas to release all the hostages, stating \"we will show no mercy on our enemies\". But a group representing hostages' families said the Israeli government \"chose to give up the hostages\". The statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed shock and anger at what it called the \"deliberate dismantling of the process to return our loved ones\". The group later gathered for a protest outside the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem, calling on the government to bring the hostages home. Some called for an end to the war and Netanyahu's resignation. The Israeli air force attacked targets in Gaza City, Rafah and Khan Younis in the early hours of Tuesday. Ramez Alammarin, 25, told AFP news agency how he carried children to hospital south-east of Gaza City. \"They unleashed the fire of Hell again on Gaza,\" he said of Israel, adding that \"bodies and limbs are on the ground, and the wounded cannot find any doctor to treat them\". Essam Abu Odeh and his family said they had been sleeping when the strikes started. \"Around 02:00 [midnight GMT], we were suddenly awakened by the sounds of heavy shelling,\" he told the BBC's Gaza radio service. \"My daughter woke me up, warning me about the bombs. We quickly took shelter against the walls, fearing that rubble might fall on us.\" \"It was a tough night for everyone,\" Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the UN's children's charity Unicef working in al-Mawasi, Gaza, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She woke up to the sound \"of very, very loud explosions, our guest house was shaking. For the next 15 minutes... we heard explosions almost every five or six seconds\". She described hearing yelling and sirens outside, as the sound of planes continued overhead. Officials said the health system was struggling to cope with the number of injured, which the Hamas-run health ministry put at more than 660. Twenty-five out of 38 hospitals in the region are out of service, the ministry says. Mohammed Zaquot, director general of the Gaza Strip's hospitals, told BBC Arabic the injured included people with burns and fractures, with many still waiting for surgery. \"The attacks were so sudden that the number of medical staff available was inadequate for the scale of these large strikes, and additional teams were called in immediately to assist,\" he says. Mahmoud Abu Wafah, the highest-ranking Hamas security official in the territory, has been killed (photo from 2020) UN officials have condemned the strikes. The Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Muhannad Hadi, said: \"This is unconscionable. A ceasefire must be reinstated immediately. People in Gaza have endured unimaginable suffering.\" Hamas responded furiously to the bombardment, accusing Israel of treachery over the ceasefire. It also said Israel had exposed the remaining hostages to \"an unknown fate\". But Hamas has not yet declared that it is resuming the war, instead calling on mediators and the United Nations to intervene. US President Donald Trump's administration was consulted by Israel prior to carrying out the strikes, officials said. In a brief statement to US media, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that \"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war\". Trump has not yet commented directly on the strikes. Negotiators have been trying to find a way forward after the first phase of the temporary truce ended on 1 March. The US proposed extending the first phase until mid-April, including a further exchange of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. But a Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Israel and Hamas disagreed over key aspects of the deal set out by Witkoff at the indirect talks. The war between Israel and Hamas was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed, and 251 others taken hostage. The assault triggered an Israeli military offensive that has since killed more than 48,520 people, most of them civilians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced, many of them several times.

        "title": "JFK files: Last trove of records on president's assassination released",
        "content": "President Kennedy, pictured minutes before he was fatally shot by a sniper in 1963 The US government has released the final batch of documents on the assassination of President John F Kennedy (JFK) - a case that still inspires conspiracy theories more than 60 years later.  It follows an executive order by President Donald Trump that required remaining unredacted files in the case to be made public. Experts are combing over the papers, not all of which have appeared online. They say the job will take time, and that they do not expect many ground-breaking revelations. US authorities have previously released hundreds of thousands of JFK documents, but held some back, citing national security concerns. Many Americans still believe the gunman, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not act alone. Kennedy was shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963. Trump said beforehand that 80,000 pages would be unsealed.  Of the 1,123 documents included in Tuesday's release from the National Archives and Records Administration, it was not immediately clear how much material was new. Many documents have previously been released in partially redacted form. \"You got a lot of reading,\" Trump told reporters on Monday, previewing the release. \"I don't believe we're going to redact anything.\" But some of the hundreds of files unsealed on Tuesday night did appear to have passages blacked out. Others were hard to read, because they were faded or were poorly scanned photocopies, or appeared to bear little relevance to the JFK case, specialists said. Non-scholars would probably be \"baffled\", commented David Barrett of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, as he reviewed the released material on Tuesday.  Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, he said the release was \"useful\", but he was not expecting \"earth-shaking information, either with regard to the assassination or more broadly\". Other JFK experts suggested the American public might keep wondering about the possible existence of other documents and information. \"I think there may continue to be more record releases,\" historian Alice George told Reuters. But she went on to say the passage of time made investigations hard: \"It's much harder to find the truth when most of the people involved are dead.\" The assassination of JFK: One of the US's biggest mysteries Ex-Secret Service agent reveals new assassination detail A government commission in the aftermath of the killing determined that President Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, a Marine veteran and self-described Marxist who had defected to the Soviet Union and later returned to the US. Opinion polls over decades have indicated that most Americans don't believe Oswald was the sole assassin. But no clear alternative narrative is yet to emerge from the latest batch of unsealed documents. Unanswered questions have long dogged the case, giving rise to theories about the involvement of government agents, the mafia and other nefarious characters - as well as more outlandish claims. In 1992, Congress passed a law to release all documents related to the investigation within 25 years.  Both Trump, in his first term, and President Joe Biden released piles of JFK-related documents - but thousands remained partially or fully secret. Trump's executive order two months ago also called on government archivists to release files related to the killings of presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, both of whom were gunned down in 1968. His announcement on Monday that the document release was imminent came as a surprise to his national security team, which had been working since January to prepare the files by removing redactions, according to US media reports. The Republican president vowed during last year's White House race to release JFK files, shortly after he secured the endorsement of Robert F Kennedy Jr (RFK Jr), the nephew of JFK and son of Robert F Kennedy. RFK Jr has gone on to become Trump's health secretary. He is among those who have promoted conspiracy theories about the assassination of his uncle. He was yet to comment on Tuesday's release of documents.  Trump's director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said of the release: \"President Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency.\" Watch: Unseen video shows moments after JFK assassination Trump orders plan for release of JFK and MLK assassination files Turkish President Erdogan's main rival jailed Trump looms over Canada's election as campaign begins 'The time for inquiries is over': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures 'Reeves risks union war' and 'Pontiff's progress' Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: Whatâs coming up this week Covid memories: Giving birth alone, pavement pubs and hugs outside funerals The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk A life spent waiting - and searching rows of unclaimed bodies 'My husband is a fighter pilot in Ukraine.

        "content": "Pope Francis thanked medical workers for the \"miracle of tenderness\" they offer the sick Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia and bronchitis for more than three weeks, has thanked the medical staff looking after him for their \"tender\" care.  For the fourth consecutive Sunday, the Argentine Pontiff was not present for his weekly blessing, but the Vatican shared the text he had prepared.  \"While I am here, I think of the many people who are.. close to the sick,\" he said, describing them as \"bringing a little light into the night of pain\". The Vatican said on Saturday the Pope had shown a \"good response\" in recent days to his treatment at Rome's Gemelli hospital. \"The clinical condition of the Holy Father in recent days has remained stable and, consequently, indicates a good response to the treatment,\" the Vatican said. \"There is therefore a gradual, slight improvement\", it added. In his blessing, Francis wrote that he had experienced \"thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart\". \"I think of the many people who in various ways are close to the sick, and who are for them a sign of the Lord's presence.  \"We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain.\"  On Sunday evening, the Vatican said the Pope had joined what were described as \"spiritual exercises\" for senior Catholic clerics via video link, although the Pope himself was not visible. The exercises, an annual period of spiritual reflection, were led by a preacher, as usual. The Pope joined as a \"recipient\", the Vatican said. On Saturday morning the 88-year-old prayed in the chapel of the papal suite at Gemelli Hospital, the Vatican said. The Pope has not been seen in public since entering the hospital on 14 February, his longest stretch away from the public eye since his papacy began 12 years ago. He was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties - and first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. He is particularly vulnerable to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy â an inflammation of the lungs â as a young man and had a partial lung removal. The Pope's doctors believe he is likely to face a long road to recovery, due to his age and medical history.

        "title": "Trump administration reinstating nearly 25,000 fired federal workers",
        "content": "Hundreds of people have rallied, such as these in front of the Office of Personnel Management, against the US government layoffs. US President Donald Trump's administration is working to bring back nearly 25,000 fired federal workers after judges ruled their terminations were illegal, court documents show.  Officials at 18 departments and agencies have submitted documents to a federal court detailing their efforts to rehire the laid off probationary workers to comply with the court orders.  Last week, two federal judges said the mass layoffs of the recently hired workers was illegal and ordered them to be reinstated pending further litigation.  The firings were part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). The filings made in a Baltimore federal court on Monday paint a clearer picture of the scale of layoffs across the federal government.  They reveal that 7,600 people had been laid off from the Treasury Department, 5,700 from the Department of Agriculture, more than 3,200 from the Department of Health and Human Services, and hundreds from other departments and agencies.  Many of the reinstated workers will not be heading straight back to work; they will instead be placed on administrative leave. On 13 March, Judge James Bredar of Maryland and Judge William Alsup of California ordered the agencies to rehire thousands of fired probationary workers.  Judge Bredar's ruling did not stop the agencies from firing the workers, but took issue with the manner in which it was done. His decision came after a lawsuit was brought by 19 Democratic-led states and Washington DC, which argued that mass layoffs would trigger a rise in unemployment claims and add pressure on social services. In a later response to the government's efforts to reinstate the workers, the judge said the agencies had made \"meaningful progress toward compliance\". Separately, Judge Alsup criticised the decision to place the rehired workers on administrative leave, telling government lawyers that it \"would not restore the services the preliminary injunction intends to restore\".  In response, the justice department said in its filings that placing workers on administrative leave was the first step towards fully reinstating them. The department has appealed both federal court decisions. These are not the only rulings against the US government's effort to reduce the size of the bureaucracy.  On Tuesday, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from taking any further steps to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

        "title": "More than 50% of adults predicted to be obese by 2050 worldwide",
        "content": "More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050. The findings come in a new study of global data published in The Lancet, external journal, covering more than 200 countries. Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries.  However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a \"profound tragedy\". By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese. The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990.  If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050.  In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050. However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million. Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese. The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.   Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems. The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US.  She said: \"[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies. \"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure,\" she added. How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work? A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people. Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021. However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected. The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years. \"But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible,\" she said. \"Our estimates identify children and adolescents in much of Europe and south Asia living with overweight who should be targeted with obesity prevention strategies.  \"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment. \"This is essential to avoid intergenerational transmission of obesity and to prevent a wave of serious health conditions and dire financial and societal costs for future generations.\" Your Voice, Your BBC News: What story do you want BBC News to cover?

        "title": "Michelle Mone PPE firm evidence to be heard in private, Covid inquiry rules",
        "content": "Doug Barrowman, who led PPE Medpro, pictured alongside his wife Baroness Michelle Mone.  The chair of the Covid inquiry has ruled that evidence related to PPE Medpro, the firm linked to Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, will be heard in a closed, private session next month. On 3 March, the inquiry will begin four weeks of hearings into decisions to buy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Baroness Hallett said she was imposing the restriction as she was satisfied there was a risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings if \"sensitive evidence\" was heard in public. Victims' groups and media outlets, including the BBC, had argued the dangers were overstated, given the early stage of the police investigation and the material already in the public domain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) opened an investigation into PPE Medpro in May 2021 into suspected criminal offences committed in the procurement of PPE. The company was awarded government contracts worth more than Â£200m after Baroness Mone recommended the firm to ministers during the Covid pandemic. Baroness Mone, 52, and Mr Barrowman, 59, have denied wrongdoing. In June 2024, the NCA said an unnamed 46-year-old man from Barnet, north London, had been arrested as part of its investigation. To date, no criminal charges have been brought and the Crown Prosecution Service has not been formally instructed by the NCA. On 9 December 2024, the Covid inquiry said it had received an application from the NCA for a restriction order, claiming there was a risk of harm to its investigation if sensitive evidence about PPE Medpro was heard in public. The NCA originally wanted to prevent the inquiry hearing any evidence about the company, saying \"other contracts could be selected\". It then asked for 26 witness statements written by its staff to be withheld, and an order to be made preventing certain questions about the firm to be asked in the inquiry room in a public session. It argued those restrictions should include the identity of any person under investigation; evidence relating to the opinion of any government official concerning PPE Medpro's contracts; and evidence about payments to the company and who ultimately benefited. In its submission, it said there was a \"realistic possibility that criminal charges against one or more individuals will flow from the investigation\". The Department of Health later asked for the terms of any restriction order to be widened to include any \"financial material and correspondence\" relating to the purchase of PPE from the company, although that request has been rejected by the inquiry. What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work? The National Crime Agency's investigation into PPE Medpro opened in May 2021.  In her final ruling, external, Baroness Hallett said it was both \"necessary and proportionate\" for the Covid inquiry to examine contracts between the government and PPE Medpro. But she did accept there was a risk of damage to any future criminal proceedings if she allowed all the evidence to be heard in public. As a result, any sensitive evidence about the company will be heard in a private, closed hearing, expected to be held in late March. She said the NCA's original application, which also sought to have members of the press and other organisations excluded from those closed sessions, went \"further than necessary\" and was \"too wide an approach\". Representatives of five media organisations will be invited to attend but will not be able to report on the proceedings until the conclusion of any criminal case, including possible appeals. Baroness Hallett said that decision was in line with previous public inquiries, including the investigation into the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury. A spokesman for the NCA said its investigation into PPE Medpro \"remains a priority\".  \"In such cases it can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted,\" he added.

        "title": "South Africa's anti-apartheid activists haunted by their persecution as compensation anger brews",
        "content": "Many young people sacrificed their lives to fight the racist system of apartheid It was late at night on 10 December 1987 when prison officers had woken Mzolisi Dyasi in his cell in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. He remembers the bumpy drive to a hospital morgue where he was asked to identify the bodies of his pregnant girlfriend, his cousin and a fellow anti-apartheid fighter. In response, he had dropped to one knee, raised his fist in the air, and attempted to shout \"amandla!\" (\"power\" in Zulu), in an act of defiance.  But the word caught in his throat as he was \"totally broken\", Mr Dyasi tells the BBC, recalling the sight of his loved ones under the cold, bright lights. Four decades on, Mr Dyasi sleeps with the lights on to ward off memories of the physical and mental torture he suffered during his four years in prison. He says that he struggled to build a life for himself in the society he fought for as an underground operative for uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the-then banned African National Congress (ANC). The ANC led the struggle against the racist system of apartheid, which ended in 1994 with the party's rise to power in South Africa's first multi-racial election.  A Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which was co-chaired by the internationally renowned cleric Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was established to uncover the atrocities committed by the apartheid regime, and a state reparations fund was set up to assist some of the victims.  But much of that money has largely gone unspent. Mr Dyasi was among about 17,000 people who received a one-off payment of  30,000 rand ($3,900; Â£2,400 at the time) from it in 2003, but he says that has done very little to help him. He had wanted to complete his university education but has still not paid for courses he took in 1997.  Now in his 60s, he suffers from chronic health issues and finds it difficult to afford medication on the special pension he receives for veterans who participated in the struggle for freedom and democracy. Mzolisi Dyasi (C), pictured here on his way to the funeral of a political activist in 1993, feels let down after the sacrifices he made Professor Tshepo Madlingozi - a member of South Africa's Human Rights Commission who spoke to the BBC in his personal capacity - says the effects of apartheid continue to be devastating.  \"It was not only about the killing of people, the disappearance of people, it was about locking people into intergenerational impoverishment.\" He says that despite the progress made over the past 30 years, many of the \"born-free generation\" - South Africans born after 1994 - have inherited the cycle. The reparations fund has about $110m untouched, with no clarity on why this is the case.  \"What is the money being used for? Is the money still there?\" Prof Madlingozi commented.  The government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.  Lawyer Howard Varney has spent much of his career representing victims of apartheid-era crimes and says that the story of reparations in South Africa is one of \"deep betrayal\" for the families affected. He is currently representing a group of victims' families and survivors who are suing the South African government for $9m over what they say is its failure to adequately handle cases of political crimes that were highlighted by the now-disbanded TRC for further investigations and prosecutions.  Brian Mphahlele was polite and soft-spoken; he would pause before responding to a question, as if waiting for his thoughts to pool in his mind. He suffered from memory loss, just one aspect of the lasting impact of the physical and psychological torture he had undergone at Cape Town's notorious Pollsmoor Prison. Mr Mphahlele told the BBC that the 30,000 rand pay-out, which he had received for the violations he endured during his 10 years in prison, was an insult. \"It went through my fingers. It went through everybody's fingers, it was so little,\" the 68-year-old said on the phone last year from his nephew's home in Langa township in Cape Town, where he lived.  He felt that a more substantial payment would have enabled him to buy his own home and described his frustration at his life in Langa, where he ate at a soup kitchen three times a week.  Since he spoke to the BBC, Mr Mphahlele has died, his hope of a more comfortable life unfulfilled. Prof Madlingozi says that South Africa became the \"poster child\" of racial reconciliation following the end of apartheid, and inspired the world in many ways. \"But we have also unintentionally given a wrong message, which is that a crime against humanity can be committed without consequence,\" he says. Though he feels things can still be turned around. \"South Africa has an opportunity 30 years into democracy to show that you can make mistakes and fix those mistakes.\" Mr Dyasi still remembers the sense of freedom and optimism he felt when he left prison in 1990 after South Africa's last white ruler FW de Klerk unbanned the ANC and other liberation movements, paving the way for anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela to become the first black president four years later.  But Mr Dyasi says he does not feel proud of who he is today, and his disappointment is felt by many who fought alongside him and their families.  \"We don't want to be millionaires,\" he says. \"But if the government could just look at the healthcare of these people, if it could look after their livelihood, involve them in the economic system of the country.\" \"There were children that were orphaned by the struggle. Some children wanted to go to school but they still can't. Some people are homeless.  \"And some people would say, 'You were in prison, you were shot at. But what is it that you can show for it?'\" Athol Fugard: Death of a great South African playwright How royal divorce papers have shaken the Zulu kingdom Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?

Essam Abu Odeh and his family had been sleeping when the war planes came again. \"Around 02:00 [midnight GMT], we were suddenly awakened by the sounds of heavy shelling,\" he told the BBC's Gaza radio service. \"My daughter woke me up, warning me about the bombs. We quickly took shelter against the walls, fearing that rubble might fall on us.\" Israel's planes tore in from the north to sweep across the strip, striking Gaza City in the centre and then targets further south in Rafah and Khan Younis. The blitz on Monday night killed more than 400 people, mostly women and children, local health authorities run by Hamas said. They did not identify the number of combatants killed - Israel says it targeted Hamas commanders. More than 600 more are injured. Once again, hospitals in the territory were inundated,  doctors on night shift battling a sudden influx of injured, many of them children. Israeli strikes on Gaza - follow live updates The BBC met the family of one injured man, Ahmad Mo'in al-Jumla, at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. He had been at the Beach refugee camp in al-Ahrar when it was hit. \"We were shocked this area was targeted,\" says his sister, noting they couldn't find him at first. \"From the night until morning, we couldn't figure out if he was injured or not, because the scene was horrific, and no one had any news - the entire building had collapsed on everyone in that area.\" At 05:00, they pulled him out from under the rubble. He was alive - but was rushed to hospital with fractures and a brain injury. His family too endured their own ordeal when their neighbourhood was hit. \"Suddenly, we found the house collapsing on us, rubble falling from every direction,\" his sister said. \"We tried to get out, we wanted to escape but there was nothing. It was night and suddenly there was bombing on the house.\" An Israeli strike destroyed this residential building in Deir Al-Balah \"The war resumed abruptly, without warning,\" says another Gaza resident M. He was getting up for his Suhoor, or pre-dawn meal, when his street was struck by gunfire and shelling. \"A sense of terror swept through the area,\" he says. \"Everyone was filled with fear - unsure of where to go or if we could be displaced again.\" \"Fear has once again gripped the people, especially as we are in the month of Ramadan,\" he said. Israel pounded Gaza throughout the morning, the strikes easing as the sun came up. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the attacks, his office said, after Hamas failed to release more hostages or accept US proposals for extending a ceasefire that had held since late January.  Since the first phase of the ceasefire had come to an end earlier this month, there had been fears of the fighting resuming again - especially as talks stalled two days ago.  The White House on Monday night was briefed by Israel before they resumed their attacks. But those living in Gaza were blindsided. The return of the warplanes shattered what had been two months of a fragile peace. \"I was shocked that the war started again, but at the same time, this is what we expect from the Israelis,\" Hael a resident from Jabalia al-Balad told BBC Arabic. \"We were not surprised; we expect this at any moment,\" he says about the truce's collapse. \"But the shock is enormous - 200 martyrs [people killed] in moments. As a citizen, I'm exhausted. We've had enough - a year-and-a-half to this! It's enough\", he said. Before the ceasefire in late January, the war had gone on for 15 months with Israeli airstrikes and bombardments killing more than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza. Umm Mohammed Abou Aisha, living in Deir al-Balah in the east, had managed to survive with her mother throughout that period.  But her mother was killed on Tuesday morning.  Her last memory is of her entering the kitchen, saying she wanted to make her morning meal. \"My mother woke up as usual to prepare her Suhoor meal, getting ready to fast but not ready for fighting,\" she told Reuters news agency. Umm Mohammed Abou Aisha's mother was killed in a strike in the east The strike hit their neighbour's home, blasting the vicinity, she said. She has questioned the state of the supposed peace.  \"Life is getting harder, there is no truce or ceasefire.\" \"There are snipers [stationed] daily in front of the citizens, continuous strikes. There is nothing of what was agreed upon [in the ceasefire]. Another resident, Mohammed Bdeir, said his daughter was killed - their street was bombed as the whole family was sleeping. \"[We] suddenly woke up on the strike, they hit our neighboursâ¦ we found this girl beneath the rubble, we pulled her mother and father from under the rubble.\" He then found his daughter's body there too, he told AFP news agency. Palestinians react at the site of an Israeli strike on a building in Jabalia in northern Gaza South-east of Gaza City, Ramez Alammarin, 25, described carrying children to a hospital. \"They unleashed the fire of hell again on Gaza,\" he told AFP, adding that \"bodies and limbs are on the ground, and the wounded cannot find any doctor to treat them\". Hospital authorities in Gaza have told the BBC many patients being carried in are suffering severe head injuries and bleeding, burns, fractures. \"The attacks were so sudden that the number of medical staff was inadequate for the scale of these large strikes,\" said Dr. Mohammed Zaqout, Director General of Gaza Strip's hospitals. He notes there are only seven hospitals able to operate across the territory at the moment, after 15 months of war. And despite the truce, few medical supplies had been allowed into Gaza. Another doctor described the situation as catastrophic. There's a severe shortage of medical and surgical equipment, intensive care beds, medications. \"Even the medical staff have been completely exhausted after more than a year-and-a-half of continuous emergency work,\" said Dr Muhammad Abu Salmiya. \"We have seen many wounded people lose their lives right in front of us simply because there are no medical supplies or any possible way to offer them care.\" He called Israel's actions at dawn a \"massacre against sleeping civilians in the Gaza Strip\". The most admissions so far have been at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis in the south. People were rushing stretchers with the wounded to the hospital. Bodies covered in white sheets were also taken to the hospital's mortuary. Families were gathering for funerals in the street. Essam, the father woken by his young daughter this morning, says he's begging mediating countries to bring an end to their suffering. \"We do not want war to be resumed. We seek peace so that we can live and sleep without fear,\" he told the BBC.

        "title": "Israel to cut off electricity supply to Gaza, minister says",
        "content": "Israel ordered all of Gaza's electricity supply to be cut off on Sunday in an effort to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining Israeli hostages held in the territory.  Energy minister Eli Cohen's announcement came a week after Israel cut off all aid supplies to the territory, which has a population of more than two million people.  In a video statement on Sunday, Cohen said: \"We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after [the war].\" The decision to cut electricity is expected to primarily affect the operation of desalination plants, which are crucial for providing clean drinking water. The government said it has not ruled out cutting off water supplies. In his statement, Cohen said: \"I have just signed the order to stop supplying electricity immediately to the Gaza Strip.\" Israel cut off most of the mains electricity supply to Gaza earlier in the war. Talks to prolong the fragile ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on 1 March, are expected to resume in Qatar on Monday.  Israel wants Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire.  But Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase, which would see the release of the remaining hostages from Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent end to war.  Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages as well as the bodies of 35 others. The militant group - which has warned that cutting off supplies to Gaza would affect the hostages as well - said on Sunday that it had wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position and called for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase. Gaza's coastal territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated by the war, and generators and solar panels are used for some of the power supply.  Israel has faced criticism over cutting off supplies to Gaza.  \"Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,\" the United Nations human rights office said on Friday. Hamas has reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. That committee would work under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is based in the occupied West Bank.  Israel has rejected the PA having any role in Gaza but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule. Hamas's attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.

        "title": "Rachel Reeves summons regulators to No 10 in drive for cuts to red tape",
        "content": "The chancellor has told regulators there is \"too much bureaucracy\" as she aims to slash red tape to boost economic growth. Rachel Reeves met industry watchdogs on Monday, revealing plans to cut the cost of regulation, including on environmental measures, and axe some bodies entirely. It comes as a leading think tank cut its UK growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 as it downgraded prospects for the global economy over trade war concerns. The government has made boosting growth its main priority, but the Conservatives said Labour's taxes were harming growth and called on Reeves to set out a \"real plan\". Reeves told regulators at the 40-minute meeting that the current level of bureaucracy made it \"too slow to get things done\". \"There are a number of things over the last decade or so that have held back growth, and one of them - if we are honest and you know better than anyone - is the regulatory landscape,\" she said. Reeves also spoke about reducing the duplication of work done by regulators.  In its latest forecast, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) cut its predictions for UK growth to 1.4% in 2025, from its previous forecast of 1.7%, and to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1.3%. However, the forecast is more optimistic than the Bank of England, which earlier this month cut its UK growth forecast for 2025 to 0.75%. Economic forecasts are not always accurate but predictions from the OECD are looked at closely. The OECD said that for the world economy, growth would slow from 3.2% in 2024 to 3.1% in 2025, largely as a result of the trade tensions sparked by US President Donald Trump's introduction of tariffs on imports into the US. In response to the OECD's forecast, Reeves said: \"This report shows the world is changing, and increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board.\" The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January, contracting by 0.1%, which was weaker than forecast, driven mainly by a decline in the manufacturing sector. Ahead of Monday's meeting with regulators, Reeves said. \"By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.\" Changes announced by the government include streamlining the environmental regulatory process for major projects including Lower Thames Crossing (subject to planning approval) and future ones such as a Heathrow expansion. Meanwhile, environmental guidance, including hundreds of pages on protection of bats, will be reviewed, while environmental permits for some low-risk and temporary projects will be removed. This plan comes alongside 60 measures agreed upon by watchdogs \"following weeks of intense negotiations\" that are designed to make it easier to do business in the UK. Those measures include:  Fast-tracking new medicines through a pilot to provide parallel authorisations from healthcare regulators Reviewing the Â£100 cap on individual contactless payments Simplifying mortgage lending rules to make it easier to re-mortgage with a new lender and reduce mortgage terms Setting up a 'concierge service' to help international financial services firms navigate regulations Civil Aviation Authority permitting at least two more large drone-flying trials for deliveries in the coming months - which the government said has already cut travel times for blood samples between hospitals from 30 minutes down to two minutes Last week, the government said it was abolishing NHS England, the world's biggest quango - short for a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the move was the \"beginning, not the end\" and he wants to slim down bloated bureaucracy, meaning more quangos could go. The government has already announced plans to fold another quango, the Payments Systems Regulator, into the Financial Conduct Authority. Reeves announced on Monday the abolition of a third - the Regulator for Community Interest Companies, which will be folded into Companies House. The chancellor has promised to significantly cut the number of regulators by the end of the Parliament. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said that Labour's taxes and trade union red tape were preventing businesses from focusing on growth. \"Rachel Reeves has nine days until her emergency budget, where the Conservatives are calling on her to set out a real plan forÂ growth,\" Stride said. Mark Allan, chief executive of commercial property firm Landsec, said: \"We have been through a period over many years of having regulation laid on top of existing regulation.\" While moves by the government were \"very positive\", he added that \"we're starting from quite a low base, so to me this is more of a three-year project than a three-month project before we start to see that coming through.\" UK economy shrank unexpectedly in January Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?

        "title": "Sir Gareth Southgate: Boys need role models, not gaming and porn",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Gareth Southgate on impact of social media on young men Sir Gareth Southgate says he fears young men are spending too much time gaming, gambling and watching pornography - and they need better role models beyond online influencers. In a wide-ranging talk for the BBC's annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture, the ex-England men's football manager spoke about his own experience of missing a crucial penalty at Euro 96, saying he didn't let it define him. \"That pain still haunts me today,\" he said, \"and I guess it always will.\" Referencing his own experiences, he said the UK needed to do more to encourage young people - especially young men - to make the right choices in life and to not fear failure. Rather than turning to teachers, sports coaches or youth group leaders, Sir Gareth said he feared many young men were searching for direction online. There, he said they were finding a new kind of role model, one that too often did not have their best interests at heart. \"These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain,\" he said. \"They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, that strength means never showing emotion, and that the world, including women, is against them.\" Sir Gareth Southgate: The Richard Dimbleby Lecture The ex-England manager reflects on his personal journey, belief and resilience Sir Gareth spoke about missing the crucial penalty in the 1996 Euros semi-final, when England lost to Germany. \"Missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me stronger, a better man,\" Sir Gareth said at the lecture. \"It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience I never knew existed.\" This video can not be played Watch: Gareth Southgate shares lessons from Euro 96 penalty miss He contrasted his own miss with Eric Dier's successful penalty kick against Colombia in 2018, when - with Sir Gareth as manager - England won a World Cup penalty shootout for the first time. During the intervening 22 years, he said there had been a change in mindset among England players. \"In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss,\" he said. \"In 2018, Eric had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing he would score.\" During Sir Gareth's career as a defender and midfielder, he played for Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough and was in the England squad between 1995 and 2004. He took over as manager in 2016 and led the team to the 2018 World Cup semi-final, 2022 World Cup quarter-final and Euro finals in 2020 and 2024. He stepped down as manager in July, two days after England lost to Spain in the Euros. Sir Gareth has been credited with revitalising the England team and was knighted in the King's New Year Honours in December. Sir Gareth celebrates after England beat Colombia following a penalty shootout at Spartak Stadium, Moscow, in July 2018 He is the latest in a line of academics, business leaders and other notable figures to deliver the Richard Dimbleby Lecture, which has been held most years since 1972 in memory of the broadcaster. Previous speakers have included King Charles III, when he was the Prince of Wales, tech entrepreneur and philanthropist Bill Gates, and Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Sir Gareth's talk focused on the importance of belief and resilience for young men, and he cited three things needed to build these: identity, connection and culture. He referred to a report, released earlier this month by the Centre for Social Justice, which said boys and young men were \"in crisis\", with a \"staggering\" increase in those not in education, employment or training. \"Too many young men are isolated,\" Sir Gareth said in his talk. \"Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to friends or family. Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how best to push them to grow. And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone.\" \"Young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions,\" he added. \"They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography.\" Ukie - the UK's trade body for video games - said it was \"disappointed\" by the way the former England manager characterised gaming. In a letter to Sir Gareth it said: \"Video games should be celebrated for their positive impact, as a medium that connects people, teaches new skills, drives creativity, and boosts the economy.\"  Sir Gareth also said young men don't get enough opportunities to fail and learn from their mistakes. \"In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys now, we will inevitably make life harder when they grow up to be young men,\" he said. \"Too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it. They fail to try, rather than try and fail.\" The ex-footballer also reflected on what his career has taught him about belief and resilience. \"If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is much more than the final score,\" he said. \"True success is how you respond in the hardest moments.\" The Richard Dimbleby Lecture with Sir Gareth Southgate is broadcast at 10.40pm on BBC One and available on iPlayer now Are you a parent or a football coach with views on this story? Get in touch The Beautiful Game: Building Belief and Resilience in a Younger Generation Good evening. Tonight, I want to talk about two very different penalty kicks, separated by more than two decades, but connected by two characteristics far more powerful than football. These characteristics have picked me up when I've been down, grounded me in success, and given me purpose amidst the noise of public life. They are qualities that everyone, young and old, needs every day of their lives. They are belief and resilience. Now, I'd like you to picture the old Wembley Stadium, it's England versus Germany, semi-final of Euro 96 a tournament that has captivated the nation, up to this point, extra- time has finished and we're locked at 1-1. And my childhood hero Bryan Robson has asked me would I take penalty number 6 if it goes to sudden death. Now I've been captain of every team that I played for and this is my hero asking the questionâ¦ So, you just don't say no at those moments. Butâ¦ I am thinking as I'm walking awayâ¦ Mmm, let's hope it doesn't go to thatâ¦  1-0, 1-1 I'm not a regular penalty taker, with a process to fall back on... 2-1, 2-2 But never mind because Dave Seaman saved one last weekend so we'll be ok... 3-2 and actually Dave this would be a really good moment to save one... 3-3 What happens if I miss? My brain has now entered the arena of what might go wrong and now I'm in trouble... 4-4,  5-5 In front of 90,000 people and millions watching at home. Let me tell you that 30-yard walk from the centre circle to the penalty spot feels like you've walked from Land's End to John o' Groats, and that's basically how my legs felt when I got there as well. It was as much as I could do to hit the target, forget placement or powerâ¦ the keeper duly saves. And we're out... I feel I've let myself down, my teammates down, my country down. That pain still haunts me today and I guess it always will. Now, that single shot could have defined my life, let alone my football career. It didn't. But how I chose to respond to it did. And that's what I want to talk about tonight. How do you build resilience when the going gets tough? How do you cultivate belief, in individuals,  AND in a collective? And how do you build a positive culture not just for a national football team, but for a nation? Before I delve into this topic, I want to personally thank the Dimbleby family, and the BBC, for this enormous honour and wonderful opportunity to deliver the 2025 Richard Dimbleby Lecture. Since 1972, the Lecture has been delivered by 45 speakers, including princes, scientists, influential business and religious leaders, as well as other prominent figures. So adding the former England football manager to the illustrious list is certainly a bold selectionâ¦ Nowâ¦ there's a slight question mark hanging over my head about bold selections... so I really hope this one works for you! Richard Dimbleby was not just a broadcaster, but an extraordinary man of belief and resilience. The exact themes I want to explore. So, it really is an honour to be standing here today. Every generation faces its own challenges, and today's young generation is no different. Life is never easy, setbacks are almost always part of the journey. I discovered this myself fairly early on. I'd always dreamed of being a professional footballer. At 13 years old I'd been asked to train with Southampton at their Centre of Excellence in Crawley. And I loved it. But, much to my dismay, after two enjoyable years, I received a letter to say I was being released. Now, I'm not saying I was bitter, but I've still got the letter. So let me read some of it to you, whether you want to hear it or not. Dear, I should add \"Dear\" is typed, Gareth Southgate, which is handwritten, you get the feel of the personal nature of this. On behalf of Southampton Football Club, I'm writing to inform you that we will not be offering your sonâ¦ a place on our centre of excellence. Let's leave that there. It was the first time in my football career that my belief and resilience was tested. Fortunately I'm driven and I don't give upâ¦ and eventually I got a second chance when Crystal Palace offered me an apprenticeship at 16. I have to say I really struggled adapting to football being a job, rather than something I did with my mates at the weekend; struggled with the physical demands of playing against men for the first time. In fact after two months my youth coach, Alan Smith, hauled me into his office and said: Look, you're a lovely fella, good mannersâ¦ If you were my son I'd be really proud, but actually you're weak... and as a footballer you've got absolutely no chance. Now there was no written evidence this time, so I've made Alan sit in the front row of the audience and he can answer of himself at the end of the evening. It actually took me five years to break into Palace's first team, most of my mates got released in that time. Let me tell you, its unbelievably hard to make it as a professional footballer. While I faced tough times during the early part of my career, I believe the world for young men and women they are growing up in today is increasingly difficult. Not because they are born weaker, or without the resilience of past generations, but because the pressures they face today are unique. And at the heart of this is the unrelenting impact of social media. Today, young people are bombarded by information at all times of the day, from a device that fits neatly into the palm of their hand, and updates by the second. They are targeted with images of the perfect body, the perfect career and the perfect life.  A beautifully crafted highlights reel where success appears to be instant and effortless. How can this make them feel good about themselves? When I was growing up, the only people I had to compare myself to were the other kids on my street, in my school or my football team. I was a bit of an idiot, there were some idiots over there, I knew roughly where I stood in the pecking order really, realised nobody was perfect. But now you can find yourself mocked, bullied or ridiculed if it appears that you don't conform to whatever is deemed to be the latest trend of the day and believe me I should know. As hardened as I am to opinions and criticisms, there's no way I was going to trawl through social media last summer and read a load of abuse. It wouldn't have helped me in any way to do my job and so I had to shut myself off from it as far as I could. And it seems that young people themselves actually recognise this problem. A recent poll of 16 to 24 year olds from the National Education Union found that the majority believe social media has become more toxic and addictive in the past five years, negatively impacting their mental health, sleep, attention span, and ability to work or study. I'm actually sure this comes as no surprise to any parent who asks their child on a daily basis to put their phones away. The solutions are complex because bad habits have been formed. But ignoring the negative impact of social media on our young people is not an option. In recent months, my curiosity about the landscape for our young people has led me to visit community centres, schools and even a prison, and I've had a lot of fascinating meetings with academics, teachers, youth workers, and coaches. And in all those interactions, there's one topic that keeps being brought to my attention. And it's parents who keep raising it. Young men are suffering. They are feeling isolated. They're grappling with their masculinity and with their broader place in society. This issue was highlighted recently when the Centre for Social Justice published a report entitled Lost Boys, focused on the \"crisis\" - to use their word - facing boys and young men. It found that across most metrics of importance within society - education, employment, health, and others - young men are falling behind. And how sad is this, suicide remains the leading cause of death for men aged under 50 in the UK. That is heartbreaking. Now, I would at this moment just like to say that I care deeply and equally about the plight of young women. By focusing my remarks on young men, I don't, for a second, intend to underplay their challenges, not least around self-esteem and mental health, especially today. I've worked with some amazing women, I have a beautiful daughter and wife, I care deeply about them all. But given my background, and having developed young men throughout my career, I feel more qualified to talk about the challenges they face. And as one mother told me recently: \"One of the most impactful things we can do for women is to focus on improving young men.\" So why is this happening? Why do so many young men feel lost, isolated, or without hope? From an early age young boys need to fail often and learn fast. Falling off a bike, splitting up with friends, messing up exams and maybe evenâ¦ missing a penalty. These are the moments that test belief and build resilience. It's a paradox that all parents face. And as a parent myself, I get it. Do we protect them from failure - out of love and support, or expose them to risks that may challenge their resolve? In my opinion, if we make life too easy for young boys nowâ¦ we willâ¦ inevitably... make life harder when they grow up to be young men Ironically, parents know exactly what their children are doing in the physical world, but they are losing control in the virtual world â¦. where young people are exposed to far more danger ...and failure is something that is shared with the world. The result is that too many young men are at risk of fearing failure, precisely because they've had so few opportunities to experience and overcome it. They fail to tryâ¦ rather than try and fail. What seems to have changed is a sense of traditional family and community role models. The Centre for Social Justice report highlights how 2.5 million children in the UK have no father figure at home. This is, as they describe it, \"an epidemic of fatherlessness,\" noting that boys are more likely now to own a smartphone than to live with their dad. Now all the experts I've listened to over the last 20 years speak about the importance of male role models in a boys life. That actually doesn't have to be just at home. There's a point at which boys look naturally for mentors outside their immediate family, and is often where they find the role models who inspire them the most. I've always believed \"You don't need to be a Dad to be a father figure.\" However boys are spending less time at youth centres, sports facilities and community events. They aren't meeting the traditional role models I used to meet such as coaches, youth workers and teachers. Which leads neatly to my third observation As real-world communities and mentorship declines, young men end up withdrawing, reluctant to talk or express their emotions They spend more time online searching for direction and are falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming, gambling and pornography. And this void is filled by a new kind of role model who do not have their best interest at heart. These are callous, manipulative and toxic influencers, whose sole drive is for their own gain. They willingly trick young men into believing that success is measured by money or dominance, never showing emotion, and that the world... including women... is against them. They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives. So if young men are falling behind, if they don't believe in themselves, and if they are becoming less resilient, what can WE do? What can WE change? How can WE reverse this decline? Because qualities like belief and resilience aren't something you're simply born with. They don't appear overnight. They are built - step by step, experience by experience, through grit and determination. From my professional experiences, I've learnt that belief and resilience sit on three key foundations: Identity, Connection, and Culture - and that these elements are as important to wider society as they were to the England football team. Let's start with identityâ¦ One of the first questions every young man should ask themselves is: Who am I? For some this question is shaped by their family history. A big part of who I am is down to my Grandad's military service and the values of duty and respect that he and my parents instilled in me. Race, obviously plays a major role. Many young men in Britain today have dual heritage. They are balancing British Nationality with family roots in Africa, the Caribbean, Asia or Europe. It's such an important part of our country. Regional location, opportunity and class all contribute significantly as well. The England squads I managed were made up of players from all these backgrounds. Everyone had their own story, their own values and their own identity. But when I became England Manager, no one had the answer to the question \"who are we?\" What was our shared identity, the DNA of the team, that everyone understood, and were proud to be a part of? In response we deliberately set out to define it. We shared personal stories... we talked about our country... the football legends who came before us... and our place in history. By the end we knew who we were. A proud, diverse, resilient team that stood up for each other... and was ready to write our own chapter in English football history. It meant that when we anticipated racist abuse ahead of games, the players had the powerâ¦ and supportâ¦ to decide their response if it happened. They chose not to be intimidatedâ¦ but to stand upâ¦ play onâ¦ and win regardless. Similarlyâ¦ moral decisionsâ¦ about whether to take the knee before games as a way of protesting against racism or discrimination, became unanimous and obvious ones to take. Players had a positive impact on society and inspired youngsters up and down the country. And that is the power of identity. Young men in our society face the same questions of \"who am I?\" and \"who are we?\". And just like our players, owning your story... and understanding that you are part of a bigger narrative that existed before you... and will continue long after you're gone. That's the first step to building belief and resilience. But being secure in your own identity isn't enough. You need to authentically connect with those around you. You need to feel the sum is greater than the part. That is because human beings are social creatures; we form relationships because they are essential to our wellbeing and survival. No matter how talented you are as an individual, success is impossible without the right people around you When I arrived as England Manager, there was a disconnect between the team, the media, AND the fans. It was clear to me that strengthening those connections between these three core audiences was critical if we wanted to improve the fortunes of the team. It's well documented that we decided to be more open and honest with the media, using social media in a positive way to offer an insight into the genuine camaraderie that existed. This gave a more emotive, trusted connection between the players and the fans - and it also gave us some memorable images of inflatable unicorns. But the most important and strongest connections were within the team. I wanted to really get to know my players, and I spent a lot of time talking to each of them about their lives, their hopes, and their fears. They were happy to talk to me and they were happy to talk to each other. Players looked forward to meeting up. We had fun. We laughed together and at times even these strong powerful men, opened up to me about their feelingsâ¦and cried on my shoulder. And that's fine by the wayâ¦ and I think it's an important message for young men today. It was these connections and relationships that created the belief and resilience  that carried us beyond where we might have gone when times got really tough. We weren't just playing for the badge, we were playing for each other. Now, growing up in a digital age, it can be easy to think that young men are more connected than ever before. But I actually believe the opposite is true. Real connection - the kind that gives you belief and resilience - is becoming harder, not easier, to find. You can have millions of followers online, and not one person to turn to when you really need help. The result is that too many young men are isolated. Too many feel uncomfortable opening up to family or friends. Many don't have mentors - teachers, coaches, bosses - who understand how to push them to grow. And so, when they struggle, young men inevitably try to handle whatever situation they find themselves in, alone. When I think about my own career, I know I wouldn't be here without the strong relationships I have built and the people who supported me. My family, who provided a loving, supportive environment from the start of my life, that continues today through my wife and my children. Or Alan Smith, my youth coach, at Crystal Palace, who wasn't afraid to challenge me - not because he wanted me to fail, but because he wanted me to succeed. And the exceptional staff I have been privileged to work with; people like Steve Holland, my assistant with England, who was skilled in the areas I wasn't, and who stood firmly alongside me when the pressure was at its most intense. It meant that whenever I've had setbacks in my career, I've never faced them alone. And that's made all the difference. We need to make sure young men today aren't facing their struggles alone either. That we are there for them, ready to build genuine connections at home, in schools, workplaces and communities. And it means reminding them that asking for help isn't a weakness - it's a strength. If identity is about knowing who you are, and connection is about building relationships, then culture is about the environment you exist in. To my mind, a culture can be defined fairly simply by \"how we do things around here\". It's made up of hundreds of small behaviours and actions that shape the overall environment. It started with me. Because the leader sets the tone for how they want people to behave... and I believe respect is crucial. Off the pitch, that meant players showing up on time, training hard, being open to learning, and reacting the right way if they weren't selected to start. On the pitch, I expected them to treat the opposition, and the referee, with respect. And always give everything for the team Culture drove some of my key decisions. I chose Harry Kane and Jordan Henderson as captain and vice-captain not just because of their talent, but because of their professionalism on the training pitch, in the gym, and in how they lived their lives away from football. They were role models I wanted others to emulate. And over time, we created a culture where players were encouraged to take ownership... where young players were welcomed, not treated as outsiders... and where mistakes weren't ridiculed, but were seen as part of a process. And some of the strongest decisions I took were made to protect our culture, whenever it was challenged, intentionally or not, by a lack of discipline or poor behaviours. And so it is in society. We need leaders to set the right tone... To be the role models we want for our young men. We have to show young men that character is more important than status. That how you treat others is more important than how much money you make. That values matter... courage, humility, and integrity over selfishness, greed, arrogance. The culture we create today will shape the kind of men that we inherit tomorrow. We all have the power to create that culture. Small actions at an individual level ladder up to something far bigger at a societal level. That is how we can make changes in our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities. And, yes, in our nation as well. With England, we gave ourselves the best chance to succeed. And we must give our young men the best chance to succeed as well. Having covered identity, connection and culture, it feels like a good moment to address the definition of success for young men in society today Of course, in football, some people see success as a zero sum game.  Only one team wins the league. Only one team can win the World Cup. And I agree that in sport, winning a trophy is a hugely important marker. Do I wish we had won the Euros? More than you will ever know. But even in professional sport, is winning a trophy the only marker of success? Are we, for example, dismissing the Olympic athlete who wins a silver medal after a lifetime of endeavour, but loses out because on the day someone ran a few hundredths of a second faster? If I've learned anything from my life in football, it's that success is about much more than the final score. It isn't a straight line. And it's not a single moment. Take Harry Kane who was released by Arsenal, I wonder if he's still got the letter, had several unconvincing loan spells, but has gone on to be England's record goal scorer. Everyone will remember Ollie Watkins scoring the winning goal in the semi-final of our Euros against Holland, but not so many will remember that he started his career playing non-league football. An overnight success after 20 years. And of course Bukayo Saka, I smile as soon as I see his name, who after his experience in Euro 2020, displayed quite remarkable resilience, courage, and belief in stepping up to successfully score his penalty against Switzerland last summer. None of them had a perfect, uninterrupted journey to success. Because true success is how you respond in the hardest moments. It's about having the belief and resilience to persevere. And that's the message we need to offer young men today. Not everyone will win trophies. Not everyone will be at the top of their field.  But everyone can live a life where they can constantly strive to improve. Where they can look back and say: I gave my best, I stayed true to myself, and I made a difference. That is real success. And the sooner we teach young men that, the sooner we help them find belief in themselves. When I think back to that challenging, life-defining night at Wembley in Euro 96, I remember not just the miss, but what followed - and what gave me hope. I was in a daze. Terry Venables comforted me while Tony Adams dragged me around the stadium to face and thank the fans. But it was Stuart Pearce who truly understood what I was going through. He had missed a crucial penalty in the 1990 World Cup semi-final, ironically, though somewhat inevitably, also against Germany! Back at the hotel, Stuart sat with me over dinner and explained what I'd face in the coming weeks. He told me about the sleepless nights that would follow; what the front pages of every newspaper would be the next morning; and how, for years to come, people would hurl abuse in my direction, reminding me of my penalty miss. He was right about all of that. But he also had a wonderful way of putting it all into perspective. I remember him saying: \"Gareth, tomorrow I'm going home to feed the horses. I'll look at them and say, 'We lost to Germany again on penalties.' And they'll answer: 'Well what do we care? Give us some carrots!'\" He made me smile, and he was there for me when I needed him the most, and I was delighted to hear him in typically great spirits when I spoke to him a couple of days ago. One of the most important things Stuart did for me in those dark days back in 1996, was to explain how this experience would make me stronger. Now frankly, I didn't believe him at the time. But slowly, Stuart's words proved to be true. He forced me to ask the hard questions: What do I stand for? How do I move forward? How do I make sure this is just one chapter and not the whole book? I will let others judge whether it made me a better player. But missing that penalty was undoubtedly a watershed moment that made me a stronger, better man. It forced me to dig deep, and revealed an inner belief and resilience that I never knew existed. At the beginning of the lecture, I said I was going to talk about two penalties. Up to now, I've only spoken about one. Twenty-two years after missing that penalty, I found myself watching another penalty shoot-out - only this time I was the England manager, we were playing against Colombia, for a place in the quarter-final of the 2018 World Cup. The game has been one of those typical England nights, absolute rollercoaster. We somehow managed to concede in the last minute of normal time, for context England haven't won a knockout game for 10 years and have lost all five of its previous penalty shoot-outs â so, I can imagine most of the country were hiding behind the sofa, Meanwhile I was actually pretty confident... mainly because I wasn't taking the penalty this time. But by failing in 1996, it helped me to understand what was required now. The decisive penalty fell to Eric Dier, not one of our superstars or a regular penalty taker. But a brilliant team man. And this was his moment. And as my eyes followed him on that long, lonely walk to the penalty spot, I hoped - maybe prayed a little â that he would help us to write a new chapter in English football history. Because this time, it felt different. And this time, it was different. If you look at the photos of my reaction, you can probably see the decades of pain. For me personally, that moment wasn't just relief, but it was a small step of redemption. More importantly something in the English football mindset had changed. By instilling a belief and resilience in our players, we had broken down one more barrier to winning. In 1996, I had walked 30 yards to the penalty spot believing I would miss. In 2018, Eric had walked those same 30 yards believing he would score. And so, in conclusion, I'd like to say this to young people, and to young men in particular: Each of you will face your own version of that penalty moment. For most, it won't be on a football pitch in front of 90,000 people. Maybe it's the moment you didn't do as well as you hoped to in an exam. The moment you get rejected from a job. Or the moment you just feel like someone has let you down. BUT in that moment, you have a choice: do you let disappointment define you? Do you give up? Or do you get back up, learn from it, and keep going? That choice - the ability to build belief, to find resilience - is what makes the difference. Not just in football. Not just in sport. But in life. And I believe, as a society, we must do more to help young people, and especially young men, make the right choices in life. We must create a world where they find comfort in their own identity and a sense of belonging to those around them; where they feel they live in a culture that doesn't judge them only by how well they succeed, but by how much they grow... by the effort they put in... and the character they develop; and where they know there is always someone there to provide the love and support they need, especially in difficult times. That is how we will create a young generation, a society, and a nation of which we can all be very proud. And I'm looking forward to playing whatever role I can to help make it happen. Thank you.

        "content": "The \"Stormzy effect\" has contributed to an increase in applications to Cambridge from black students across the UK, the university says Stormzy has been nominated for an honorary degree alongside one of the most decorated British female Olympians, Dame Katherine Grainger. In 2018 the musician, whose real name is Michael Ebenezer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr, launched a scholarship programme for black students at the University of Cambridge. The institution said he would receive a doctorate in law in recognition of his philanthropic work and impact on education, music, sport and literature. Eight people will be recognised by the university, including Dame Katherine, the first female chair of the British Olympic Association. In November Dame Katherine Grainger became the first female chair in the 119-year history of the British Olympic Association Cambridge University said the \"Stormzy effect\" had contributed to an increase in applications to the university from black students across the UK. The Stormzy Scholarship funds two black British students per year at Cambridge, covering their tuition fees and maintenance costs. It was later expanded when HSBC UK agreed to fund a further 10 students per year. The university said 55 students had been supported by a Stormzy Scholarship so far, and this year would see the largest group to date graduate. Dame Katherine will also receive a doctorate in law from the university.  She is currently chancellor of the University of Glasgow and is the only British woman to have won a medal at five successive Olympic Games.  Sir John Rutter, founder and director of the Cambridge Singers, is to be granted a doctorate in music All eight of those recommended have accepted the honorary doctorate nomination, subject to final approval by the university's governing body. They will be admitted to their degrees on 25 June, presided by vice-chancellor Prof Deborah Prentice. An honorary doctorate in letters will be granted to Sir Simon Russell Beale, who is an honorary fellow of Gonville and Caius College, where he studied for his undergraduate degree.  Political activist, philosopher and author Professor Angela Davis will also receive a doctorate in letters.  The founder and director of the Cambridge Singers, Sir John Rutter, whose work has been performed all over the world, will be granted a doctorate in music. Lady Arden of Heswall, the former justice of the UK's Supreme Court and an honorary fellow of Girton College, will receive a doctorate in law.  She was the first female judge assigned to the Chancery Division at the High Court of Justice.  The Nobel Prize-winning economist Sir Oliver Hart will receive a doctorate in science.  Professor Maria Leptin, the president of the European Research Council, will be conferred with a doctorate in medical science.  Do you have a story suggestion for Cambridgeshire?

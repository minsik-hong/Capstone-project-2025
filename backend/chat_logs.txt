Her husband, Ramin Dehbandi, expressed deep sorrow and plans to seek justice through civil courts, highlighting the emotional impact on their daughter, who blames him for her mother's absence.

2025-04-25 10:26:29.905494 | Q: 한국말 해봐 | A: Asian economies are experiencing significant market declines due to fears of a global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's new tariffs, which range from 10% to 46% on various countries. Major stock indices across Asia, including the Shanghai Composite, Hang Seng, and Nikkei 225, saw their largest drops in decades, with Hong Kong's market plummeting over 13%. The tariffs are particularly damaging to Asia's manufacturing sectors, heavily reliant on US exports, affecting countries like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Analysts warn that the heightened tariffs could lead to inflation and a potential recession in the US, which would further harm Asian economies. Global markets have lost trillions in value since the tariff announcements, with predictions of continued volatility. | Sources: ['https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c934qzd094wo']

Four people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance and death of a two-year-old boy named Emile Soleil in the French Alps. Among those arrested are Emile's grandparents and their adult children. Prosecutors are investigating the case, which has gained a lot of media attention in France.

Last year, some of Emile's bones and clothes were discovered by a hiker near his grandparents' home. However, investigators could not determine the cause of his death. They mentioned that it could have been due to a fall, manslaughter, or murder. The recent arrests have brought new hope for answers in a case that seemed to have gone cold.

Emile was last seen on July 8, 2023, walking alone in his village. His grandmother reported him missing shortly after. Many people, including police and volunteers, searched for him, but it took time to find his remains. Emile's funeral was held in February 2024, and his family has expressed a strong desire for answers about his death.

2025-05-05 13:59:12.848318 | Q: usa news | A: **Article Summary**

US President Donald Trump has signed an order to reduce the funding and operations of the Voice of America (VOA). He claims that the organization is "anti-Trump" and spreads "radical propaganda." The White House says this decision will protect taxpayers from funding what they consider biased news.

VOA was created during World War II to fight against Nazi propaganda. It currently reaches millions of people around the world each week. Mike Abramowitz, the director of VOA, mentioned that he and most of his staff are now on paid leave, making it hard for VOA to fulfill its important mission, especially with countries like Iran, China, and Russia spreading false information about the US.

The National Press Club, which represents US journalists, criticized Trump’s order. They believe it threatens press freedom and the future of independent journalism at VOA. The order also affects the US Agency for Global Media, which funds other news organizations like Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

Many employees at VOA and related organizations have been told there is no money to pay them. The Czech Republic's Foreign Minister hopes the European Union can help keep Radio Free Europe operating. Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, has called for VOA to be shut down. Trump has also cut funding for other federal agencies, including those that help the homeless and support museums.

Voice of America started in 1942 to combat enemy propaganda. It has a public charter to ensure its independence. Over the years, it has adapted to changing laws and continues to serve a large audience.

  

**Important Words**

- **Dismantling**  
  - Breaking something down or taking it apart.

- **Propaganda**  
  - Information that is spread to promote a particular point of view, often biased or misleading.

- **Adversaries**  
  - Enemies or opponents, especially in a political or military context.

- **Independent**  
  - Not controlled by others; able to make decisions on its own.

Richard McDonald, a former champion runner and trader, is now trading stocks privately. He was surprised by the rapid market changes caused by global tariffs announced by Donald Trump. These tariffs led to a significant drop in stock prices and created uncertainty in the market. Many investors are unsure about the future and are choosing to hold cash instead of stocks. Some tariffs were paused, but high tariffs on imports, especially from China, remain. This situation is causing inflation and economic concerns.

2025-05-05 15:00:29.146790 | Q: Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine: at least 45,287 people were killed.  This is almost three times more than in the first year of the invasion and significantly exceeds the losses of 2023, when the longest and deadliest battle of the war was taking place in Bakhmut.  At the start of the war, losses happened in waves during battles for key locations, but 2024 saw a month-on-month increase in the death toll as the front line slowly edged forward, enabling us to estimate that Russia lost at least 27 lives for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory captured.  The BBC Russian Service, in collaboration with independent media outlet Mediazona and a team of volunteers, has processed open source data from Russian cemeteries, military memorials and obituaries.  So far, we have identified the names of 106,745 Russian soldiers killed during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  The true number is clearly much higher. Military experts estimate our number may cover between 45% and 65% of deaths, which would mean 164,223 to 237,211 people. | A: ### Article Summary (EN)
Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces in the war in Ukraine, with at least 45,287 soldiers killed. This number is almost three times higher than in the first year of the invasion. In 2023, the longest and deadliest battle took place in Bakhmut. Initially, Russian losses occurred in waves during battles for important locations, but in 2024, the death toll increased every month as the front line moved forward. Estimates suggest that Russia lost at least 27 soldiers for every square kilometer of Ukrainian territory captured. The BBC Russian Service, along with Mediazona and volunteers, has identified 106,745 Russian soldiers killed, but the actual number is likely much higher, with estimates ranging from 164,223 to 237,211 deaths.

### Explanation (KR)
작년은 우크라이나 전쟁에서 러시아 군대에게 가장 치명적인 해였습니다. 최소 45,287명의 군인이 사망했으며, 이는 침공 첫 해의 거의 세 배에 해당합니다. 2023년에는 바흐무트에서 가장 길고 치명적인 전투가 벌어졌습니다. 처음에는 주요 지역 전투 중에 러시아의 손실이 발생했지만, 2024년에는 전선이 앞으로 나아가면서 매달 사망자 수가 증가했습니다. 추정에 따르면, 러시아는 점령한 우크라이나 영토 1제곱킬로미터당 최소 27명의 군인을 잃었습니다. BBC 러시아 서비스는 Mediazona 및 자원봉사자들과 함께 106,745명의 사망한 러시아 군인을 확인했지만, 실제 숫자는 훨씬 더 높을 것으로 보이며, 전문가들은 사망자 수가 164,223명에서 237,211명 사이일 것이라고 추정하고 있습니다.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the US Health Secretary, announced a major research effort to find the causes of autism within five months. Experts believe this task is unrealistic and complicated. Kennedy has previously supported false claims linking vaccines to autism. He stated that the research will involve many scientists and will explore various factors, including environmental influences. However, the Autism Society of America criticized his plan as misleading and harmful. Concerns were also raised about his hiring of David Geier, a controversial figure in vaccine research. The idea that vaccines cause autism has been widely discredited since a flawed study in 1998.

### Explanation (KR)
로버트 F. 케네디 주니어 미국 보건부 장관은 자폐증의 원인을 5개월 안에 찾기 위한 대규모 연구 노력을 발표했습니다. 전문가들은 이 작업이 비현실적이고 복잡하다고 생각하고 있습니다. 케네디는 이전에 백신과 자폐증의 연관성을 주장한 바 있습니다. 그는 이 연구가 많은 과학자들을 포함하고 환경적 요인도 조사할 것이라고 밝혔습니다. 그러나 미국 자폐증 협회는 그의 계획이 잘못된 정보와 해로운 영향을 미친다고 비판했습니다. 또한 백신 연구에서 논란이 있는 데이비드 기어를 고용한 것에 대한 우려도 제기되었습니다. 백신이 자폐증을 유발한다는 주장은 1998년의 결함이 있는 연구 이후 널리 반박되었습니다.

Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah ______ (be) Namibia's first female president.

A) is

        "content": "This video can not be played Cory Booker's speech slamming Trump's agenda pushes past 24 hours US Senator Cory Booker has broken the record for the longest speech ever delivered in the Senate.  The New Jersey Democrat's marathon address, a symbolic protest against President Donald Trump, in which he warned of a \"grave and urgent\" moment in American history, ended after for 25 hours and four minutes.  Although it was not a filibuster - a speech designed to obstruct passage of a bill - it held up legislative business in the Republican-controlled Senate. The rules for such speeches require a speaker to remain standing and forgo bathroom breaks. The previous record was held by Republican Senator Strom Thurmond who, when still a Democrat in 1957, spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act. Booker said he would speak for as long as he was physically able as he began his address at around 19:00 local time on Monday evening. He concluded at 20:06 on Tuesday. The 55-year-old, who is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the chamber, filled some of the time reading letters from constituents, who said they had been harmed by President Trump's policies. This video can not be played Watch: 'My strategy was to stop eating' Booker explains how he prepared for 25 hour speech The former presidential candidate also ran out the clock by discussing sports, reciting poetry and taking questions from colleagues. Booker, who is African-American, spoke of his roots as the descendant of both slaves and slave-owners.  \"I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people are more powerful,\" he said, referring to segregationist Thurmond's record-setting address 68 years ago. As he reached the milestone, Booker said he was going to \"deal with some of the biological urgencies I'm feeling\".  He was able to give his jaw much-needed respite during the speech by taking questions from colleagues, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The Democratic Party, currently out of power in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, rallied behind Booker's symbolic act of protest. Booker's speech is also the longest in the Senate since a 21-hour filibuster in 2013 by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, against Obamacare. Cruz told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a filibuster is a challenging physical feat.  For his own protest, he wore comfortable shoes and tried to drink as little water as possible - an approach he described as \"nothing in, nothing out\".

        "title": "Trump is pressing the nuclear option on tariffs",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: What we do and donât know about Trumpâs âLiberation Dayâ tariffs Every time Donald Trump has mentioned his plan to levy massive tariffs on imports into the US, there has been a widespread assumption that they will be delayed, watered down or rowed back. Today, he will reveal in the White House Rose Garden not just how serious he is about \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\", but effectively call time on decades of economic globalisation. And it is still possible that he will do this by launching the equivalent of a salvo of ballistic missiles into the global trading system, with a universal tariff on all imports into the USA. The option of a 20% universal tariff is the only way to get to some of the massive revenues of trillions of dollars claimed by some of his advisers. World braces as Trump set to announce sweeping tariffs In recent days, President Trump has been adamant that the tariffs will be \"reciprocal\" and the US will be \"nicer\" to its trade partners.  That doesn't rule out wide-scale imposition of tariffs at 10 or 20%, if, for example, the US deems that Value Added Taxes are tariffs.  It is possible that countries could be very broadly bracketed into different levels of a basically universal tariff. As one G7 negotiator told me at the weekend, \"it all comes down to President Trump\". A system such as this, with equivalent global retaliation, would see the UK economy shrinking by 1%, enough to wipe out growth and lead to pressure for tax rises or spending cuts.  The total cost around the world could, according to an Aston University Business School study, be $1.4 trillion (Â£1.1tn), as trade is diverted, and prices rise. UK will take calm approach to US tariffs, PM says Three big unknowns ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Is Trump right when he says the US faces unfair trade? Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs In industry, there is some expectation that the European Union will target US tech companies. There could be quite the contrast should the UK choose not just to hold back on retaliation, but offer a significant tax cut to US big tech. Trade wars are hard to win, and easy for everyone to lose.  A universal tariff of 20%, or its equivalent, would be a historic hit to the global trading system. There is something bigger here, however. As the Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".  As that has not panned out, especially in the case of China, the US is moving away from this world. If the US overplays its hand in alienating its allies today, China will be waiting. The hit to US business in Europe, for example, could be offset by cheaper electronics, clothes, and toys from the East arriving in the UK and lowering prices, diverted from the US market. What starts later today is designed not just to reshape America, and trade, but the way the world itself has been run.

        "title": "Smoking ban in public places in Wales introduced 18 years ago",
        "content": "Jenny Phuwichit says she vapes every day, and doesn't feel that health warnings around smoking have impacted young people They are the first adults in Wales to have never known a smoke-filled bar or club. To have lived their whole lives unaccustomed to the smell of cigarettes lingering on  clothes after a night out. It is 18 years since the ban on smoking in public places was introduced in Wales to reduce the effect of second-hand smoke. The legislation was a milestone in shifting attitudes, according to one public health expert. But with smoking still the norm in some areas, Prof Graham Moore said further work was needed to achieve smoke-free goals. The Welsh government said children's exposure to smoke had reduced and fewer people were being admitted to hospital for heart attacks and childhood asthma. How many people still smoke in the UK? Outdoor smoking ban at pubs being considered - PM Plan to make Wales 'smoke-free' by 2030 Smoking rates have fallen dramatically, though questions have been raised around the glamourisation of cigarettes in popular culture. \"It surprises me actually how many of my friends do smoke, or have smoked and then given up,\" said 21-year-old Swansea University student Henry Gillard. \"I suppose it's one of those things that you think is cool when you're younger, and you try it. \"Even with a smoking ban in pubs, people do still smoke quite a lot.\" His friend Anton Beugelink, 21, said vaping was \"definitely a lot more popular\". Students Henry Gillard and Anton Beugelink say friends still smoke, but vaping is far more popular Cameron Mattu, 20, said he does not smoke but a lot of young people were afraid to admit it because of the associated health risks. \"It's a lot more hidden. People do it in secret now.\" Jenny Phuwichit, 20, said she vapes every day, and does not feel that health warnings around smoking had impacted young people. \"I see people on the streets, smoking and vaping, next to younger kids as well, they're not really caring,\" she said. \"[The risk] is just kind of ignored,\" she said, \"people will do it anyway.\" Pub owner Vicky Morgans from Swansea recalled the \"smelly clothes and stained ceilings\" before she introduced the ban a month earlier at West Cross Inn. \"It was going to come anyway. Some customers weren't particularly happy, others were delighted with it,\" she said. \"It did have a massive impact on our drinking culture. It nose-dived overnight. But, we were making progress in our food-led side of the business. \"Fortunately, we survived, where perhaps others didn't.\" Ms Morgans brought in a smoking ban in her pub in March, a month earlier than the introduction of the ban across Wales on 2 April 2007 Prof Graham Moore from Cardiff University said \"targeted work and support\" would be required for those who wanted to give up, in areas where smoking rates remained high. \"When you grow up with it, where smoking is the norm, you are much more likely to take it up yourself,\" he said. \"In particular neighbourhoods you are much more likely to be surrounded by retail outlets selling it, so it becomes more pervasive in their lives. \"There are still areas where smoking is quite the norm. \"There are definitely groups where smoking rates haven't been tackled as extensively as at a population level. Historically people with mental health difficulties for example - rates of smoking are really high and have not come down as much as the population level.\" However, previous research showed the 2007 legislation had helped to shape a different attitude. \"A lot of young people have no real experience of being exposed to tobacco, but of those that did, there was a sense of disgust where they encountered it in the street.\" He added that about 7% of children leave secondary school as smokers, but recent surveys have suggested a slight drop in smoking, after previously flatlining. While the goal was to protect the next generation from the harms of smoking, the health service still sees the ongoing cost of generations of adults who smoked, with deprived communities disproportionately affected. It is estimated there were 17,195 hospital admissions per year in Wales due to smoking - an average of 3.4% of all admissions of those were aged 35 and over. Research by Public Health Wales (PHW) also showed on average among that age group, 10.7% of all deaths in Wales (3,845) were also associated with smoking. Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths in the UK, with around 1,900 deaths in Wales alone each year. Work is still under way on a bill - introduced by the previous UK government - to ban the sale of tobacco to everyone born after 1 January 2009. The ban on smoking in \"enclosed\" or \"substantially enclosed\" public places was brought in by Wales and Northern Ireland, including workplaces and vehicles on 2 April 2007 The ban had already been in place in Scotland for a year and was rolled out in England three months later In 2015 rules in Wales were extended to include cars carrying children By March 2021 outdoor childcare settings, school grounds, public playgrounds and hospital grounds were also included The Welsh government has a goal for Wales to be smoke-free by 2030, meaning a prevalence rate in adults of 5% or less.  PHW research suggested in 2022-23 prevalence was 13%. The Welsh government said: \"The introduction of smoke-free spaces 18 years ago was the first big step in making smoke-free the norm, helping to encourage people to stop smoking and changing our view of smoking. \"Since then, Wales has taken further action, including becoming the first part of the UK to ban smoking in hospital grounds, public playgrounds and school grounds. \"This was real step forward in improving Wales' public health. Children's exposure to harmful second-hand smoke has reduced; more people have made the decision to stop smoking and fewer people are being admitted to hospital for heart attacks and for childhood asthma.\" Children's voices used to shame hospital smokers NHS offers 'improved' stop smoking pill Disposable vapes to be banned from June Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Massive layoffs begin at top US health agency",
        "content": "An employee was denied access to her building and had her badge taken away Hundreds of federal health workers early on Tuesday learned their jobs had been cut, with many turned away at their office building doors, as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved forward with its mass restructuring plan. The layoffs included  several top officials and affected agencies responsible for overseeing the nation's food and drug safety, as well as those fighting disease. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced last week that 10,000 workers would be laid off, and through voluntary departures, the workforce would be reduced from 80,000 to 60,000. President Donald Trump has worked since inauguration day with adviser Elon Musk to slash the federal payroll. The White House said last week that it planned to cut 3,500 full-time employees at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 2,400 workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The administration has said it is cutting 1,200 employees from the National Institutes of Health, as well.  Health workers began hearing as early as 05:00 EDT (10:00 BST) on Tuesday that they were being dismissed.  Well before sunrise, Preston Burt, a communications specialist with the CDC's Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice for 10 years, received an email saying that he, along with his entire division, was laid off. The division had hundreds of employees who worked with 33 states, primarily helping local health departments gather environmental health data and providing the public with information about hazards such as mercury and radon poisoning.  Two weeks ago, Burt and other division staff took part in an exercise to evaluate how to respond to a nuclear or radiological incident. All those staff members have been let go, he said.  \"Now if there's a nuclear disaster, who are they going to call on as experts?\" he asked. While Burt was not shocked by the firing, others learned they had been laid off when they showed up to their offices and were unable to scan their badges to enter. Employees waited in long lines outside to access the buildings during the confusion and chaos.  HHS is a department with a $1.8 trillion (Â£1.39 trillion) budget that oversees 13 agencies, including the CDC, the FDA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The top officials laid off in the restructuring included the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Jeanne Marrazzo. She succeeded Anthony Fauci in directing the agency that had led the US fight against Covid-19. Marrazzo  - and several other directors - were notified that they were being reassigned to HHS's Indian Health Service division in other locations, according to media reports. They were asked to decide by Wednesday whether they planned to accept the new roles.  The administration also fired FDA staff who were involved in the government's response to bird flu, according to Reuters. Outbreaks of the avian flu have caused egg prices to skyrocket, while cases in cows and humans have sparked concern among public health officials.  The cuts also come as the US is battling one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade.   In a post on X, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is still one of the more powerful members of the House of Representatives,  said the administration's plans would \"directly harm our most vulnerable communities and make America sicker\".  \"I will work with my colleagues in Congress to fight back against these shortsighted  and irresponsible cuts,\" she said.  As a part of Kennedy's broader restructuring, HHS is also consolidating its 28 agency divisions into 15 new ones, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, to help carry out Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again agenda. In announcing the changes, Kennedy, said HHS was \"inefficient as a whole\" and that the cuts would remove \"bureaucratic sprawl\".  In a statement, HHS has said the cuts will save taxpayers an estimated $1.8b per year. HHS has made cuts to public health funding, too. Last month, the administration announced it was pulling back $11b in Covid-19-era funding that states and local health departments were using for other purposes, including mental health and addiction as well as infectious disease outbreaks like measles and bird flu.  Washington, DC, and 23 states on Tuesday sued the US government for slashing the funding. Republican Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, and Independent Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, who lead the senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committee have requested Kennedy to testify at a 10 April hearing to explain his \"proposed reorganization\" of HHS.

        "content": "The girl entered the river close to Barge House Causeway, near London City Airport An 11-year-old girl who went missing in the River Thames has been named as Kaliyah Coa. The Met Police said \"a recovery mission\" was now under way to find her along the Thames. Police were called at about 13:20 BST on Monday after Kaliyah, who had been playing during a school inset day, entered the water near Bargehouse Causeway, near London City Airport in east London. Emergency services conducted a large-scale search in an effort to find her. Ch Supt Dan Card from the Met said: \"Specialist officers are supporting Kaliyah's family through this deeply upsetting time and our thoughts go out to all those impacted by what has happened. \"We are committed to finding Kaliyah and are working with partners to conduct a thorough search over a wide area - utilising drone technology and boats.\" He added: \"I'd like to thank the members of public, our first-responding officers, and colleagues from other emergency services, as they responded rapidly to carry out a large-scale search during a highly pressurised and distressing time.\" The force is appealing for witnesses. It said Kaliyah's family had \"asked for privacy at this distressing time\". The force search on Monday involved boats and helicopters from HM Coastguard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and London Fire Brigade. People living nearby said Kaliyah had been playing near the water with a young boy and girl.   They said they had heard shouts and screams and other children who were playing had said a girl had disappeared in the water and they could not find her. One woman, who later found shoes, a sock, a coat and phone by the river, had taken a life ring to the water but could not see Kaliyah. Bargehouse Causeway is a concrete slope that goes directly into the River Thames and is used to transport boats. Some residents pointed out that it appeared to be covered in moss and is slippery.

        "title": "Over 300 children killed since Israel's new Gaza offensive, Unicef says",
        "content": "The United Nations agency for children says that at least 322 children are reported to have been killed since Israel launched a renewed offensive in Gaza two weeks ago. Unicef said at least 609 other children were reportedly wounded during the same period. \"The ceasefire in Gaza provided a desperately needed lifeline for Gaza's children and hope for a path to recovery,\" said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell. \"But children have again been plunged into a cycle of deadly violence and deprivation.\" Israel launched its renewed Gaza offensive on 18 March, blaming Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the ceasefire and free the 59 hostages still held captive in Gaza.  Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of violating the original deal they had agreed to in January. Unicef said \"relentless and indiscriminate bombardments\" had resumed in Gaza, with 100 children killed or maimed every day in the 10 days to 31 March.  Most of the children who were killed had been displaced and were sheltering in makeshift tents or damaged homes, it said.  Unicef uses figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry - figures which Israel has consistently disputed. The figures are seen by the UN and other international institutions as being reliable.  International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC it is \"committed to mitigating civilian harm during operational activity\" and to \"respecting all applicable international legal obligations, including the law of armed conflict\".  It said it \"makes great efforts to estimate and consider potential civilian collateral damage in its strikes\".  Since the war began more than 18 months ago, Unicef said that 15,000 children have reportedly been killed, over 34,000 reportedly injured, and nearly one million children repeatedly displaced. The humanitarian situation across Gaza has dramatically worsened in recent weeks, with Israel refusing to allow aid into the Gaza Strip since 2 March - the longest aid blockage since the war began.  \"Without these essential supplies, malnutrition, diseases and other preventable conditions will likely surge, leading to an increase in preventable child deaths,\" Unicef wrote in a press release.  The UN announced it was reducing its operations in Gaza on 24 March, one day after eight Palestinian medics, six Civil Defence first responders and a UN staff member were killed by Israeli forces in southern Gaza. The IDF launched a campaign to destroy Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries, in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage. More than 50,399 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?

It later emerged he had tackled the leader of the gunmen and saved the life of an SAS soldier. He was awarded the George Medal, which recognises outstanding bravery, for his actions. In pictures: Iranian embassy siege in London PC Lock, pictured here with his wife Doreen, was presented with the George Medal at Buckingham Palace On 30 April 1980, six gunmen took over the Iranian embassy in Kensington, holding 26 people hostage.  The gunmen belonged to a dissident Iranian group opposed to Ayatollah Khomeini, the religious leader who came to power in Iran in 1979. Mr Lock was a member of the diplomatic protection squad guarding the embassy when it was stormed.  He helped relay messages from the gunmen to police negotiators via an open window and telephone. During the negotiations, the gunmen demanded the release of 91 political prisoners held in Iran as well as an aircraft to take them and the hostages out of the UK. Most of their hostages were Iranians but also included BBC sound man Sim Harris, BBC News organiser Chris Cramer and tourists who had stopped by to collect visas. On the sixth day of the stand-off, the government ordered the SAS to raid the embassy after the gunmen shot dead Iranian press attachÃ© Abbas Lavasani and dumped his body outside the building. More than 30 masked troops entered the embassy from the balcony and front and back doors, throwing grenades through the windows. Gunshots and screams could be heard from inside the building. Some 15 minutes later, the hostages emerged and were escorted by Scotland Yard police to waiting ambulances. During the raid, PC Lock tackled the leader of the gunmen - known as Salim - and saved the life of an SAS soldier. One hostage was killed and two were wounded in the crossfire - the rest were freed safely by the special forces troops. Five of the six gunmen were killed. The survivor was jailed for 28 years. The assault was broadcast live on three channels on 5 May - a bank holiday.  In his account of the embassy hostage incident, author Ben Macintyre said Mr Lock became \"the policeman who discovered accidental courage without looking for it, wanting it or knowing what it was\".

        "title": "Car firms fined for withholding recycling information",
        "content": "Ten carmakers and two industry groups have been fined a combined total of nearly Â£78m for withholding information about vehicle recycling. BMW, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot Citroen, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Renault, Toyota, Vauxhall, and Volkswagen, and two trade bodies were fined by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The carmakers and trade groups were found to have agreed to withhold information from customers regarding the amount of their cars that could actually be recycled. It comes as the European Commission also handed out fines totalling â¬458m (Â£382.7m) to 15 carmakers, plus the European Automobiles Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), for breaking recycling laws. \"We will not tolerate cartels of any kind, and that includes those that suppress customer awareness and demand for more environmental-friendly products,\" said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for the European Commission's clean energy transition arm. The CMA said, with the exception of Renault, that the carmakers also agreed they would not tell customers what percentage of their cars were made from recycled materials. The regulator added that most of the carmakers involved did this for 15 years from 2002. It said that eight of the manufacturers it had fined made a \"buyers' cartel\" with other carmakers joining later. The buyers' cartel meant they agreed not to pay companies to handle the recycling of their customers' vehicles once the cars were considered at the end of their lives. Both the ACEA and the Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) were involved in these illegal agreements, the CMA said. Carmakers are legally required to include details on recyclability in their adverts so customers can take this into account before buying. All of the carmakers and industry bodies involved, apart from Mercedes-Benz, which has been granted immunity from penalties, have now settled with the CMA. That means they admitted to taking part in this illegal behaviour and agreed to pay the fines. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it fully cooperated with the CMA's investigation and has accepted the findings.  It said in a statement that it takes its competition law obligations \"extremely seriously\" and has \"thoroughly reviewed and bolstered its protocols to safeguard current and future compliance.\" Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Why are bills going up and what can I do about it?",
        "content": "A range of household bills, including council tax, water, gas and electricity have risen today. The BBC's cost of living correspondent, Kevin Peachey, has been answering your most asked questions on the price rises. Tashi and Chris asked why bills are going up. This is a very simple question, but I'm afraid the answer isn't straightforward. There are a host of reasons why bills are rising. On energy, it's the consequence of an increase in wholesale prices paid by suppliers, often owing to global events. Councils and water companies, meanwhile, say there's a desperate need to raise bills to pay for investment in services. Some bill increases are always scheduled for this time of year, to match the rate of rising prices - inflation. So another question is: what can you do about it? Consumer groups are urging people to shop around, claim everything they are entitled to, and cut back where possible.  We have a guide to help you here. James: I get Â£150 in cash out every week. It's amazing how it helps you budget things. Why don't more people try it? There is evidence of people turning to notes and coins to help them budget. Although cash use was hit during the pandemic, it has made a bit of a comeback, with many people taking the same view as James. However, there are areas in which this doesn't work. Shopping around for a better deal on essential bills is often something done online, and may require signing up to a direct debit payment. Rewards, or money off, are often also available to those who pay by card. So, it may well be that using a mix of ways to pay works best - but questions remain about access to cash and internet services among the vulnerable. Richard Kendall asked about frozen tax thresholds, which mean pay rises can see people drawn into paying higher rates of income tax. This is what is known as fiscal drag - not a phrase you'll hear talked about much, but it is important. It means that while income tax rates haven't risen, the income levels at which they are paid have been frozen, and will continue to be so until 2028. There have been rumours that the freeze could be extended, but there are no concrete plans for that as yet. So, more people are being dragged into paying higher rates of tax, or simply having a greater proportion of their income taxed. Taking a closer look at your pay slip is worthwhile, and it needs to be considered when looking at your personal budget. Experts say studying exactly how much post-tax income is coming in, and looking at it alongside your spending, is never a waste of time. And it may require you to trim some of your spending. Shopping around, or cancelling unused subscriptions are a good start, experts say. Colin Smith: Do we simply have to accept water bill increases because we can't shop around? Water services are different, because the 'switch for a better deal' advice simply doesn't, ahem, hold water. There is plenty of debate over why water bills are going up so much (remember some suppliers wanted bigger increases). But there are things you can do to keep your costs down, even though you can't shop around. Experts say getting a water meter fitted can reduce bills if you have relatively low usage. Water-saving shower heads, or similar, are available free from some companies. Then, there is the WaterSure scheme, which means the bill is capped for people on certain benefits, who have a medical condition, or who have a certain number of school-age children at home. You do need to apply for this help though, external. Sam Halkyard, 32, from Rotherham: How does the government expect the economy to grow with all these bill increases? Ministers are pushing their \"agenda for growth\" at every opportunity, calling for red tape to be cut to pave the way for investment. There is a delicate balancing act here. The government wants people's living standards to rise, and it wants them to spend to encourage investment by businesses. Remember, all of this comes with a background of wage rises outpacing prices, an uptick in the housing market, and some signs of hope for the wider economy. But ministers won't want to see a return of runaway inflation - the annual rise of prices - because that would inevitably lead to a rise in interest rates, and higher borrowing costs for businesses and individuals. So, outside of this, you are seeing the government push ahead with some big, long-term investment projects, like road tunnels and runways.  Jules, 57: I'm single. My wages don't go up in April. Where's the help for us? Charities have raised the alarm specifically about people like you, Jules. Citizens Advice says that single households, including single parents, tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on household bills. As a result, there is far less wriggle room financially when bills rise. One solution is to investigate all the options that are open to you. For example, as I'm sure you already know if it includes you, there is a 25% discount on council tax, external, for those who live on their own. But there is, without doubt, a single person premium on the cost of living because there's only one income coming in, so it may be harder to deal with the money going out. What you can do about the seven bills going up this week Three ways to cushion the blow of bill rises Warning bill rises hit single parents hardest David Bosworth and Jeff Rumble asked how the energy standing charge applies to bills. This is a household cost which many people feel is unfair - not least because there is nothing you can do about it. Standing charges are the fees charged to all billpayers to cover the cost of being connected to a gas and electricity supply. They are unaffected by the amount of energy that a household uses. After rising sharply in recent years, the average electricity standing charge actually fell from today - although it rose slightly for gas. More significantly, it varies considerably depending on where you live. The energy regulator, Ofgem, is considering reform that would allow people a choice of ways to pay - but stresses that these costs will still need to be covered. Ian Griffiths, from Flintshire, on council tax: Other than having my bin emptied once a fortnight, I don't actually have anything for the money I pay. In Wales, local authorities are increasing 2025-2026 council tax bills by between 5% and more than 9%. Ian may be stretching his point a little - local authorities provide a range of services such as street lighting, parks and care services. However, at its heart, his question highlights a common debate. Should these bill increases stay at the bare minimum because people are struggling financially, or are our local services in such desperate need of investment that council tax needs to go up above inflation? Lyn Nailer: Will pensioners suffer the most from these bill rises? One important point to stress here is that different people, in different areas of the country, will be affected in different ways. Water and energy bills vary depending on where you live, and the different nations of the UK have different rules on council tax and more. But the state pension is UK-wide, and the good news is that it will be going up by more than the rate of price rises from next week. The triple lock means it will increase by 4.1%. Does everyone get the full state pension? No. Does the increase mean pensioners' finances won't be stretched? Of course not. But when asked about how people will cope, ministers are inevitably pointing to this increase as evidence of how the government is helping out. David and Steve pointed out that incomes are rising, including via an increase of the minimum wage. Yes, it is not all doom and gloom today. There is an increase in the minimum wage - up to Â£12.21 an hour for over 21s - and there are increases too for younger workers and apprentices. Official figures show that average wages have been rising faster than prices. The state pension and benefits will also go up from next week. This will certainly help pay some of those bills, and you won't see the impact directly until you look at your bank balance in the coming weeks. The Treasury is also pointing to moves to freeze fuel duty and ensure the main rates of tax - income tax, VAT and employees' National Insurance - do not go up during this Parliament, as evidence of the support billpayers are receiving. Bills may be rising - but for some people, incomes are going up too. Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means: The minimum wage for over 21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, has risen by 6.7%, from Â£11.44 to Â£12.21 an hour. For someone working full time that equates to Â£23,873.60 a year, up from Â£22,368.06 For 18 to 20-year-olds, the minimum wage has gone up from Â£8.60 to Â£10 an hour. This means a full-time worker would earn Â£19,552 a year, up from Â£16,815. (Only a minority of people in this age group do work full time) Apprentices are now paid Â£7.55 an hour, up from Â£6.40.

        "title": "US prosecutors to seek death penalty for Luigi Mangione",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Luigi Mangione is arraigned in New York earlier this year US prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting dead UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Tuesday that she had directed federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment for the \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\". Mr Thompson was shot dead outside a hotel in New York on 4 December. Police arrested Mr Mangione, 26, days later in Pennsylvania after a nationwide manhunt. He has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges. He is awaiting trial in a New York prison. In the press release, Bondi said Mr Thompson's murder \"was an act of political violence\" and that it \"may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons\" nearby. Investigators say Mr Mangione was motivated to kill Mr Thompson, 50, because of anger with US health insurance companies. A lawyer for Mr Mangione called the decision \"barbaric\", accused the government of \"defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry\", and said Mr Mangione was caught in a tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors. \"While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi,\" said Karen Friedman Agnifilo in a statement.   Mr Mangione is facing 11 state criminal counts in New York, including first-degree murder and murder as a crime of terrorism. Listen: BBC Sounds presents The Mangione Trial If convicted of all the counts, he would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. But federal prosecutors have also separately charged Mr Mangione for using a firearm to commit murder and interstate stalking resulting in death. These charges make him eligible for the death penalty. Prosecutors have said the federal and state cases will move forward parallel with one another. Mr Thompson was named chief executive of UnitedHealthcare - the largest private insurer in the US - in April 2021 Mr Mangione is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) Brooklyn. New York prosecutors have already shared some evidence in their case against him, including a positive match of his fingerprints with those discovered at the crime scene.  According to New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Mr Mangione arrived in New York City on 24 November and stayed in a Manhattan hostel using a fake ID for 10 days before carrying out the attack against Mr Thompson. The healthcare boss was shot in the back by a masked assailant on 4 December as he was walking into a hotel where the company he led was holding an investors' meeting. A nationwide search led police to Mr Mangione five days later at a McDonald's hundreds of miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police said that when they found Mr Mangione, he was in possession of a ghost gun - a firearm assembled from untraceable parts - a fake ID, a passport and a handwritten document indicating \"motivation and mindset\". Mr Thompson's killing ignited a fraught debate about how the US healthcare system operates. Some Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country, expressed anger over what they see as unfair treatment by insurance firms. US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in December that the rhetoric on social media in the wake of the killing was \"extraordinarily alarming\". \"It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country, and unfortunately we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists,\" he told CBS's Face the Nation.

        "title": "Four killed in Israeli strike on Beirut, Lebanon says, despite ceasefire",
        "content": "An Israeli air strike on Beirut's southern suburbs has killed a Hezbollah official and three other people, Lebanon's health ministry says, putting further pressure on a fragile ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese armed group. The strike also injured seven people, the health ministry said. The attack was the second on the Dahieh area, where Hezbollah has a strong presence, in recent days, despite the truce that came into force in November. The Israeli military said it had targeted Hassan Bdeir, who it alleged had helped Hamas plan an attack against Israeli civilians. Hezbollah confirmed Bdeir had been killed along with his son, who was also a member of the group. Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun condemned the strike, calling it a dangerous warning. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said it was a \"flagrant violation\" of the ceasefire. The strike happened in the middle of the night, without a warning, and images from the scene show the top three floors of an apartment building had been damaged. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Israel Security Agency (ISA) and Mossad spy agency said in a statement that the military conducted a strike in the Dahieh that killed Hassan Bdeir. They said Bdeir had \"recently directed Hamas operatives and assisted them in planning a significant and imminent terror attack against Israeli civilians\". \"Due to the immediate threat\" posed, they added, Israeli forces \"acted to eliminate him and removed the threat\". The statement did not give details about the alleged threat, and indicated that the Israeli military would continue to carry out attacks in Lebanon. Lebanon's health ministry said four people were killed in the strike, including one woman. The state-run National News Agency identified two of the dead as Ahmed Mahmoud and his sister Hiam, and said their mother was among the wounded.  Later, Hezbollah issued a brief statement that confirmed the deaths of Bdeir, who it described as a \"commander\", and his son, Ali. During a visit to the scene of the strike, Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar said the group was exercising \"utmost patience and restraint\", but warned that \"this patience has limits\".  Last Friday, Israel carried out its first attack on Beirut since the ceasefire came into force, putting an end to more than 13 months of conflict with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political movement. The Israeli military said it had hit a drone storage unit used by Hezbollah after two rockets were fired from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. Hezbollah said it had no involvement in the rocket attack and remained committed to the ceasefire, and no other armed group claimed responsibility. Despite the deal, Israel has carried out near daily air strikes on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, saying it is acting to stop Hezbollah from rearming. Lebanon's government says those attacks, and the permanence of Israeli soldiers in five locations in southern Lebanon, constitute violations of the truce. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.

        "title": "Milton Keynes police shoot man dead at railway station",
        "content": "Officers said they did not believe there was further risk to the public \"at this time\"  Police have shot a man dead outside a railway station after reports he was carrying a firearm. Officers were called to Milton Keynes Central Station at 12:55 where they say they challenged a suspect carrying a knife before shots were fired at him. A man who was nearby said he had heard a \"very loud\" shot, then seen armed officers giving medical assistance to the man on the ground. A Thames Valley Police (TVP) spokesperson said \"life-saving actions\" had been taken immediately but the man had been pronounced dead at 13:44. \"There is not believed to be any further risk to the public at this time,\" the spokesperson added. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had sent investigators to the railway station after being notified by TVP. \"TVP armed officers responded and challenged a white man who was carrying a knife outside the station,\" the police force said in a statement shared later in the day.  \"He moved at speed towards officers with the knife before a shot was fired by police.\" Co-op store worker Barentina Corredor said the incident was \"quite shocking\" Eyewitnesses told the BBC they had heard screaming between the police and suspect, and the man had refused to drop to the ground. Hever Marin said he had been on a phone call in the station building when he had heard the \"very loud\" shot. \"So we went out to see and the next thing we saw was two armed cops trying to get some medical equipment to resuscitate the guy,\" he said. \"They tried for at least 10 minutes. But the guy wasn't reacting.\" A picture, seen by the BBC, shows armed police providing medical aid to a man who is lying on the pavement close to the Pret A Manger cafe. Mr Marin continued: \"It was very distressing because, we were just here... and any loose bullets could have impacted us.\" Co-op store worker Barentina Corredor said that when she had heard the noise, she had \"thought we had to find a place where we could hide - I was scared\". \"They were trying so hard on CPR - it was quite shocking to be honest,\" she recalled. An IOPC spokesperson said it would review the actions and decisions made by officers Residents of flats above the station reported hearing a single loud noise before a large police presence arrived about 10 minutes later. Edith Brockbank, 67, said: \"There was all sorts of activity trying to get people back, there was somebody trying to film it, the police were trying to tell them to go back.\" Shazna Muzammil, a councillor and Conservative group leader at Milton Keynes City Council, said she was \"deeply shocked\" by what had happened. \"Our thoughts are with all those there and affected by it,\" she posted on X, external. \"Very thankful to the police and emergency services for their swift response in keeping everyone safe.\" TVP is leading on the investigation and British Transport Police said officers would remain at the station overnight to reassure passengers and give assistance. Passengers are being ushered around a large police cordon outside the railway station Rail operator London Northwestern Railway said train services were unaffected. However, barriers were put up obscuring some station exits, with pick-up and drop-off zones closed. Passengers could still access a taxi rank and buses. Crowds were, at times, being staggered entering and leaving the station. An IOPC spokesperson said it would \"independently investigate all of the circumstances\" of the shooting, including \"the actions and decisions taken by the police\". The police watchdog added: \"It is in its very early stages and no further information is available at this time.\" Do you have a story suggestion for Beds, Herts & Bucks?

        "title": "Putin begins biggest Russian military call-up in years",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin was pictured last month reportedly visiting the Russian border region of Kursk in military fatigues President Vladimir Putin has called up 160,000 men aged 18-30, Russia's highest number of conscripts since 2011, as the country moves to expand the size of its military. The spring call-up for a year's military service came several months after Putin said Russia should increase the overall size of its military to almost 2.39 million and its number of active servicemen to 1.5 million. That is a rise of 180,000 over the coming three years. Vice Adm Vladimir Tsimlyansky said the new conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine for what Russia calls its \"special military operation\". However, there have been reports of conscripts being killed in fighting in Russia's border regions and they were sent to fight in Ukraine in the early months of the full-scale war. The current draft, which takes place between April and July, comes despite US attempts to forge a ceasefire in the war. There was no let-up in the violence on Tuesday, with Ukraine saying that a Russian attack on a power facility in the southern city of Kherson had left 45,000 people without electricity. Although Russia has turned down a full US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine, it says it did agree to stop attacking Ukraine's energy facilities. In an apparent attempt to deny Moscow had broken the terms of that deal, Russian officials said they had told Putin that Ukrainian drones had carried out attacks with little sign of a break. Russia calls up conscripts in the spring and autumn but the latest draft of 160,000 young men is 10,000 higher than the same period in 2024.  Since the start of last year, the pool of young men available for the draft has been increased by raising the maximum age from 27 to 30. As well as call-up notices delivered by post, Russia's young men will be receiving notifications on the state services website Gosuslugi.  In Moscow there were reports that call-ups had already been sent out on 1 April via the mos.ru city website. Increasing numbers of Russians are trying to avoid the army by taking on \"alternative civilian service\". But human rights lawyer Timofey Vaskin warned on independent Russian media that every new call-up since the start of the war had become a lottery: \"Authorities are coming up with new forms of refilling the army.\" Quite apart from its twice-yearly draft, Russia has also called up large numbers of men as contract soldiers and recruited thousands of soldiers from North Korea. Moscow has had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine.  The true number could be more than double. Invisible losses fighting for Russia in Ukraine Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine? Putin has scaled up the size of the military three times since he ordered troops to capture Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's defence ministry linked the December 2023 increase in the size of the military to \"growing threats\" from both the war in Ukraine and the \"ongoing expansion of Nato\".   Nato has expanded to include Finland and Sweden, as a direct result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Finland has Nato's longest border with Russia, at 1,343km (834 miles) and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday that his country would join other states neighbouring Russia in pulling out of the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines. Poland and the Baltic states made similar decisions two weeks ago because of the military threat from Russia. Orpo said the decision to resume using anti-personnel mines was based on military advice, and that the people of Finland had nothing to worry about. The government in Helsinki also said defence spending would be increased to 3% of economic output (GDP), up from 2.4% last year.

        "content": "Hakainde Hichilema, who took office in 2021, said he has gone public with his concerns after warning colleagues in private Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has warned ministers against dozing off during meetings, attributing their lack of attentiveness to \"indulgence\" and an absence of self-control. \"In cabinet somebody's sleeping at 10 hours - the question is where were they...  if you can start conking there? To me that is a crime, a serous crime,\" Hichilema said during a swearing-in ceremony, external for a new minister.  He did not spell out what exactly he meant by \"indulgence\" but local media have interpreted this as referring to excessive alcohol drinking and late-night partying. The president warned that such behaviour risked exposing state secrets and delayed service delivery to the public.  Hichilema won a landslide victory in 2021 with ambitious plans to turn around the economy of Africa's second largest copper producer. Since assuming office, he has sacked several senior officials including ministers over performance issues. Speaking on Monday as he welcomed newly appointed Local Government Minister Gift Sialubalo, the president said he has now gone public with his concerns about cabinet members after saying it in private \"over and over\". Without naming anyone, he said that some ministers \"develop a knack\" of revealing confidential state information on social media \"especially during happy hours\".   \"I have advised cabinet that we must have a self-censure. When you're in public office you must have... self-control, not to over-indulge,\" the president added.  Citing the Bible, he warned such behaviour could lead to self-destruction. \"So how do you participate in a meeting when you are sleeping? The message is very clear: you are not interested in cabinet deliberations on behalf of Zambians. So why are you sitting there?\" he asked. The president is expected to seek a second term in next year's general election. He could face stiff competition from his predecessor, Edgar Lungu, who has mounted a political come back but is currently barred from running.

        "content": "This video can not be played Listen to the progress and challenges on BBC Sounds After months of delay, Swindon's historic Health Hydro is set to reopen early next year. Originally due to be completed in late 2024, the discovery of asbestos and moisture issues has delayed the progress. Once reopened improvements to the Victorian building will include a new gym, modernised accessible changing facilities, a ventilation system and a new engine room. The facility closed two years ago to begin the multi-million-pound restoration which is phase one of the long-term goal of restoring the entire building to its former glory as a centre of health and well-being. Marina Strinkovsky - cabinet member for placemaking and planning at Swindon Borough Council Originally known as the Swimming Baths and Dispensary the facility was paid for and built by GWR workers housed in Swindon's nearby railway village. It opened in 1891 with baths and pools, a dispensary and consulting rooms for doctors, dentists and other health care professionals. The current restoration is being carried out in phases as funding is progressively secured, with the overall vision being to fully restore the building to its former glory as a centre for health and well-being. The swimming baths were paid for and built by GWR workers As well as a delayed reopening, the Grade II* listed building uncovered multiple challenges that also pushed up costs. Councillor Marina Strinkovsky who has been leading the project said working on \"an enormous historical building that has not had proper maintenance for three decades\" has been complicated. The total funding for the scheme has now risen from Â£6.5m to Â£8.6m. The additional money has been made available through a grant from Historic England, reallocated government Towns Fund money and funding from developers. The former Washing Baths Hall has been converted into a new entrance, reception area, gym and fitness suite \"We tried to make sure that as many users of the building have absolute safety, privacy and security,\" added Ms Strinkovsky. This includes levelling access to the changing facilities which include large areas for families, those who need access to a hoist and school groups. The original design of a mixed-sex \"changing village\" has also been replaced by separate changing facilities for males and females.

        "title": "Iceland volcano erupts after Blue Lagoon evacuated",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Iceland volcano spews lava after erupting Tourists and residents have been evacuated as a volcano erupted in south-west Iceland, threatening a town and popular attraction.  The volcano has been spewing lava in a fiery display of orange and red since the eruption began in the morning, creating a huge crack in the ground which has grown to 1.2km (0.75 miles) long.  Multiple earthquakes have occurred in the volcanic area throughout the day.  The volcano is close to the fishing town of Grindavik and the famous Blue Lagoon spa. A small number of people refused to evacuate the town, local media reported.  Grindavik resident Asrun Kristinsdottir told the BBC she fled after hearing emergency sirens early in the morning.  Living near the volcano for most of her life meant she always had bags packed and ready to go. But she said this time was different because of \"constant\" quakes as she was preparing to leave. The protective barriers around Grindavik have been breached, as a new eruptive fissure opened a few hundred meters inside, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported.  It was \"extremely difficult\" to see this activity inside the town's safety barriers, said Ms Kristinsdottir, who serves as president of Grindavik town council. People had been asked to \"leave the danger zone\", the region's police commissioner Ulfar Ludviksson told Iceland's RUV broadcaster. But he said individuals staying in \"seven or eight houses there... have decided to remain in the town\". There were fears that the town was \"in danger of having lava flows entering the inhabited area\", said Rikke Pedersen from the Nordic Volcanological Centre.  A hot water pipe has broken in the northern part of Grindavik, which confirms that considerable cracking has occurred within the town, the IMO said.  However, volcanic activity eased off in the early afternoon on Tuesday.  Thormar Omarrson decided to evacuate his home in Grindavik near the volcano last year, which he said was \"heartbreaking\" Thormar Omarrson runs a pizza restaurant in Grindavik that was forced to close due to the eruption. He told the BBC he had lived in the town for 30 years but relocated with his family in 2024 after the authorities warned about the increasing risk posed by eruptions. Leaving was \"heartbreaking\", Mr Omarrson said. \"My family was born and raised there and now their community is gone.\" He said some of his friends in Grindavik had refused to evacuate: \"When you live there in your home you want to be left alone in your home.\" Most of the 4,000 residents of Grindavik left in a mass evacuation in 2023 because of the dangers of the volcanic activity. The volcano has erupted several times since.  The length of the magma that formed on Tuesday under the crater series stretched to about 11 km (6.8 miles) - the longest that has been measured since 11 November 2023, meteorologists said. The magma corridor extends about 3km further northeast than seen in previous eruptions. Residents living near the volcano in the town of Grindavik were ordered to evacuate for their safety  Based on current wind direction, gas pollution from the eruption will travel northeast towards the capital area, the IMO added. The eruption, which began around 09.45 local time (10:45 BST), occurred after several earthquakes hit the area known as the Sundhnuk crater range.  Multiple eruptions have occurred on the Reykjanes Peninsula since 2021. The last time the peninsula had a period of volcanic activity was 800 years ago - and the eruptions continued for decades.

        "title": "Outrage in Somalia after man says he married missing eight-year-old",
        "content": "The incident has sparked protests in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu Outrage has spread in Somalia after an eight-year-old girl, who had been missing for six months, was found living with a man who said he was her husband. The girl was reported missing by her family in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland last September. Months later, it emerged the girl's father had consented for her to be married to an adult named Sheikh Mahmoud. Security forces surrounded the man's house last week and forced their way in after he locked himself in a room with the girl. The incident has sparked anger on social media and public protests in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. It has also prompted fresh debates about child protection laws, as currently there is no minimum legal age for marriage. \"What's more shocking than the tragedy itself are the allegations of abduction and the fact that her family had no knowledge of her whereabouts for months,\" Fadumo Ahmed, chairperson of leading rights group the Somali Women Vision Organisation, told the BBC. \"We trust the responsible institutions to take the right and necessary legal action.\" According to the eight-year-old's uncle, she was taken from her home in the city of Bosaso last September by a female relative. This relative said she was escorting the child on a trip to see another a uncle. But months later, a video surfaced online, showing the girl reciting the Quran.  Her family subsequently launched a search for the child - it is unclear why they did not do this sooner. They discovered she was in the Carmo area, living with Sheikh Mahmoud.  Sheikh Mahmoud initially said he was solely teaching the girl the Quran. But after legal complaints were filed, he changed his statement, saying he had married the girl with her father's consent. When asked by the BBC how he justified marrying an eight-year-old, Sheikh Mahmoud said that the traditions of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, along with that of the Shafi'i school of thought, allowed child marriage. After the BBC questioned his reasoning - citing opposition from numerous Somali Islamic scholars  - Sheikh Mahmoud maintained that he would not abandon the marriage. Puntland's police and human rights authorities intervened on 25 March, removing the girl from the man's home after her family filed a complaint.  The girl was now back with her family, Puntland's police force told the BBC. Additionally, an investigation into the case has been launched, government officials have said. Child marriage remains prevalent in Somalia.  According to a report published in 2020 by the United Nations Population Fund and the Somali government, 35% of women aged between 20 and 24 in the country were married before the age of 18. In 2017 this figure stood at 45%. The rate of child marriage is driven by various factors, including poverty, insecurity and traditional customs that often disregard a girl's age in wedding arrangements. In an attempt to tackle this issue, Somalia's ministry of women and human rights submitted a draft child rights bill to parliament in 2023. However, the proposal was sent back after MPs objected to certain provisions. The bill is expected to be reintroduced, but there is no clear timeline for this. âI wanted my clitoris backâ - FGM survivor opts for reconstructive surgery Risking death to smuggle alcohol past Somali bandits and Islamist fighters Why Trump is on the warpath in Somalia The men in sarongs taking on al-Shabab militants How Somalis see the 'Black Hawk Down' battle three decades on Go to BBCAfrica.com, external for more news from the African continent.

        "content": "Bletchley Park code breaker Betty Webb has died at the age of 101 A decorated World War Two code breaker who spent her youth deciphering enemy messages at Bletchley Park has died at the age of 101. Charlotte \"Betty\" Webb MBE - who was among the last surviving Bletchley code breakers - died on Monday night, the Women's Royal Army Corps Association confirmed. Mrs Webb, from Wythall in Worcestershire, joined operations at the Buckinghamshire base at the age of 18, later going on to help with Japanese codes at The Pentagon in the US. She was awarded France's highest honour - the LÃ©gion d'Honneur - in 2021.  The Women's Royal Army Corps Association described Mrs Webb as a woman who \"inspired women in the Army for decades\". Bletchley Park Trust CEO Iain Standen said Mrs Webb will not only be remembered for her work but \"also for her efforts to ensure that the story of what she and her colleagues achieved is not forgotten.\" \"Betty's passion for preserving the history and legacy of Bletchley Park has undoubtedly inspired many people to engage with the story and visit the site,\" he said in a statement. Tributes to Mrs Webb have begun to be posted on social media, including one from historian and author Dr Tessa Dunlop who said she was with her in her final hours. Describing Mrs Webb as \"the very best\", she said on X: \"She is one of the most remarkable woman I have ever known.\"  This video can not be played Listen on BBC Sounds: Mrs Webb went to work at Bletchley Park when she was 18 Mrs Webb told the BBC in 2020 that she had \"never heard of Bletchley\", Britain's wartime code-breaking centre, before starting work there as a member of the ATS, the Auxiliary Territorial Service. She had been studying at a college near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, when she volunteered as she said she and others on the course felt they \"ought to be serving our country rather than just making sausage rolls\". Her mother had taught her to speak German as a child and ahead of her posting remembered being \"taken into the mansion [at Bletchley] to read the Official Secrets Act\". \"I realised that from then on there was no way that I was going to be able to tell even my parents where I was and what I was doing until 1975 [when restrictions were lifted],\" she recalled. She would tell the family with whom she lodged that she was a secretary. Bletchley Park veteran celebrates 100th birthday Codebreaker Betty Webb reveals D-Day confidence Ex-Bletchley Park worker, 98, given French honour When WW2 ended in Europe in May 1945, she went to work at the Pentagon after spending four years at Bletchley, which with its analysis of German communications had served as a vital cog in the Allies' war machine. At the Pentagon she would paraphrase and transcribe already-decoded Japanese messages. She said she was the only member of the ATS to be sent to Washington, describing it as a \"tremendous honour\". Mrs Webb, in 2020, recalled she had had no idea the Americans planned to end the conflict by dropping atomic weapon on Japanese cities, describing the weapons' power as \"utterly awful\". After the Allies' final victory, it took Mrs Webb several months to organise return passage to the UK, where she worked as a secretary at a school in Shropshire. The head teacher there had also worked at Bletchley so knew of her professionalism, whereas other would-be employers, she recalled, were left stumped by her being unable to explain - due to secrecy requirements - her previous duties. More than half a century later, in 2021, Mrs Webb was one of 6,000 British citizens to receive the LÃ©gion d'Honneur, following a decision by President FranÃ§ois Hollande in 2014 to recognise British veterans who helped liberate France. Betty Webb, seen in the front row in a red suit, was invited to the Coronation In 2023, she and her niece were among 2,200 people from 203 countries invited to Westminster Abbey to see King Charles III's coronation. The same year she celebrated her 100th birthday at Bletchley Park with a party.  She and her guests were treated to a fly-past by a Lancaster bomber.

        "title": "Hooters: Restaurant chain files for bankruptcy",
        "content": "Hooters of America has filed for bankruptcy in Texas, as it tries to deal with its debts by selling all of its company-owned restaurants to a group backed by its founders. The firm currently directly owns and operates 151 restaurants, with another 154 operated by franchisees, mainly in the US. The company said its restaurants, which serve classic American bar food, will stay open during the process and operate \"in a business-as-usual manner\". Like many other casual dining chains, Hooters has struggled in recent years as it faces rising costs and wages, as well as customers spending less. Hooters is known for its waitresses and chicken wings \"Our renowned Hooters restaurants are here to stay,\" Sal Melilli, chief executive of Hooters of America, said in a statement, external. \"Today's announcement marks an important milestone in our efforts to reinforce Hooters' financial foundation.\" The firm said it plans to sell all of its corporate-owned restaurants to a group of two existing Hooters franchisees, who operate 14 of Hooters' most popular outlets, around the Tampa, Florida, and Chicago, Illinois, areas. The group includes some of the chain's founders, who have promised to take the firm \"back to its roots\" and make it more family-friendly. Hooters did not reveal the value of the planned deal, which still needs to be approved by a US bankruptcy judge. It said the rescue plan is expected to be completed within the next four months. Hooters was founded in 1983 and is known for its serving staff, who are mainly young women - known as \"Hooters Girls\" - as well as its chicken wings. The form-fitting outfits worn by its waiting staff have become central to the chain's public image.

        "title": "UK has best chance to overturn tariffs, says Reynolds",
        "content": "The UK will take a calm approach to US trade tariffs, rather than \"a knee-jerk reaction,\" Sir Keir Starmer has said. The prime minister suggested the UK would be affected by President Donald Trump's expected announcement on Wednesday of sweeping taxes on goods imported to the US. The UK has so far failed to negotiate an exemption, but Sir Keir said talks on a deal that could eventually see them overturned were at an \"advanced stage\". Sir Keir told his cabinet he was \"keeping all options on the table\" to respond to the tariffs, which economists have warned could damage the UK economy and increase the cost of living.  UK expects to be hit by Trump tariffs, No 10 says What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? In the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said global tariffs would \"have an impact on the UK as an open trading economy\". But she insisted \"securing a deal could mitigate some of those effects\". Trump has previously raised the possibility that countries could receive \"breaks\" from tariffs - taxes that will make it more expensive to import goods into the US. But over the weekend, Trump suggested the tariffs would hit all countries, not just those with the biggest trade imbalances with the US. Trump told reporters tariffs would \"start with all countries\" on Wednesday, an event the US president has dubbed \"Liberation Day\". On Monday, the prime minister's official spokesman said talks on an economic deal between the two countries to avoid tariffs had been \"constructive\", but he did not rule out retaliating if they were imposed on the UK. Earlier, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was in the \"best possible position of any country\" to reverse the tariffs. He said: \"I do believe not only can we get to a place where we are avoiding tariffs on each other, but we're also strengthening that relationship.\" He said negotiations that often take years had been done in days. \"And I believe that the framework of an agreement is certainly in place,\" he added, although he did not give a timescale on when an exemption might be agreed. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said a \"tit-for-tat\" approach of raising tariffs on US goods would only increase bills for British consumers.  Instead, she said the government needed to focus on getting a trade deal with the US \"as soon as possible\".  Government sources believe talks with the US administration on an economic deal have made good progress, but that at any point they risk being derailed by the president's public comments. At different times, statements by Trump about his tariffs are said to have differed from what his negotiating team had previously understood his position to be. The deal would be broader than just reducing tariffs, focusing on technology but also covering elements of trade in goods and services as well as agriculture - a controversial area in previous unsuccessful US-UK trade talks. One senior source said: \"We are pretty much there on an agreement, what we have no clarity on is when the president might sign it off or what he will do next.\" The chancellor has suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to avoid US tariffs. The digital services tax, introduced in 2020, imposes a 2% levy on tech firms, including big US firms such as Amazon, bringing in about Â£800m in tax per year. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned tariffs could wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate Reeves's buffer against her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing. The forecaster has warned that a trade war could cut the size of the British economy by 1% in the worst-case scenario. Trump has already announced a series of tariffs on steel, aluminium and vehicles coming into the US - and unlike other countries, the UK has decided not to set out plans to retaliate with tariffs of its own. But ahead of the latest round of expected tariffs, ministers are facing calls to hit back and protect UK business from the impact of Trump's taxes. The UK pharmaceuticals industry â which exported Â£6.6bn of medicine and related products to the US in 2024 - admitted it is \"worried\" about US tariffs. Steve Bates, chief executive of the BioIndustry Association trade body, told the BBC: \"Half of the world's market in pharmaceuticals is in the US and for the UK, exports of pharmaceuticals are about the same size of the car industry, give-or-take.\" The Scotch whisky industry is also bracing for tariffs, after being targeted by Trump during his first term. The US is the biggest market for Scotch exports, which totalled Â£971m last year. Annabelle Thomas, chief executive of Nc'nean Distillery on the west coast of Scotland, said large tariffs could put the company off investing in the US. She told the BBC: \"If they are lower than some were expecting, potentially we can absorb them in the short-term. \"But if they are higher, we as a small challenger brand, just don't have those resources available to us to absorb them, so we'd either need to think about raising our prices in the US or reducing our investment in the market.\" Are you concerned about the impact of tariffs on your business or personal finances?

        "title": "Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan to star in Sam Mendes' Beatles films",
        "content": "Left-right: Joseph Quinn, Barry Keoghan, Harris Dickinson and Paul Mescal are the new Fab Four Paul Mescal and Barry Keoghan have been confirmed as part of the all-star line-up who will play members of the Beatles in four major new films about the band. Normal People and Gladiator II actor Mescal will portray Sir Paul McCartney, while Saltburn star Keoghan will step into Sir Ringo Starr's shoes. The acting supergroup will also feature Harris Dickinson, who was most recently seen opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl, as John Lennon. And Joseph Quinn will go from Marvel's Fantastic Four to the Fab Four, playing George Harrison in the big-screen quadrilogy, which will be directed by Sir Sam Mendes. Sir Sam Mendes (left) introduced his band on stage at CinemaCon The Oscar-winning director was joined by the four actors for the announcement at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas on Monday. Each film will focus on a different member of the legendary group. \"Each one is told from the particular perspective of just one of the guys,\" Sir Sam told the event. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not. \"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply. But together, all four films will tell the story of the greatest band in history.\" The films will be released \"in proximity\" to each other in April 2028. The director explained: \"I just felt the story of the band was too huge to fit into a single movie, and that turning it into a TV mini-series just somehow didn't feel right.\" Paul Mescal, 29, shot to fame in the BBC's Normal People in 2020. He went on to star in acclaimed films Aftersun, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and All of Us Strangers,  and he played the lead in the Gladiator sequel. As well as portraying Sir Paul McCartney, the Irish star is about to be seen as another British creative genius, William Shakespeare, in the film adaptation of award-winning novel Hamnet. Harris Dickinson has become a star thanks to Maleficent, The King's Man, Triangle of Sadness and Where the Crawdads Sing, before playing Kidman's love interest in Babygirl. The 28-year-old Brit also received a Bafta TV Award nomination for A Murder at the End of the World, and is among the bookmakers' favourites to be the next James Bond. Barry Keoghan bears perhaps the closest resemblance to his Beatle - drummer Sir Ringo. The Irish actor is the oldest of the acting quartet at 32, and is one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, having been nominated for an Oscar for The Banshees of Inisherin before leading the cast of cult hit Saltburn. Joseph Quinn played Eddie Munson in the fourth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, was in A Quiet Place: Day One, and appeared alongside Mescal in Gladiator II. Before appearing as guitarist Harrison, the 31-year-old Londoner will be seen as Johnny Storm/Human Torch in The Fantastic Four: First Steps and two Avengers films. The Beatles are the biggest-selling group of all time Although several previous movies like Backbeat, Nowhere Boy and I Wanna Hold Your Hand have depicted The Beatles, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film. Sir Sam called the films the \"first bingeable theatrical experience\", adding: \"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house.\" On stage, Dickinson, Mescal, Keoghan and Quinn recited from the band's song Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: \"It's wonderful to be here, it's certainly a thrill, you're such a lovely audience, we'd like to take you home with us.\" They then gave a Beatles-style synchronised bow. Formed in 1960, the original band transformed youth culture and changed the course of musical history. Restlessly imaginative and experimental, they had an uncanny ability to communicate sophisticated musical ideas to a mass audience, on albums including Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and The White Album.  Despite splitting in 1970, the quartet remain the biggest-selling band of all time. Only two members survive. John Lennon was murdered in 1980, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001. In 2023, the surviving members released what was described as the Beatles' \"final\" song, Now And Then. Based on one of Lennon's old demo tapes, and featuring an archive recording of Harrison's guitar work, it went to number one and was nominated for awards at the Brits and the Grammys. This is by no means the first film project to explore the lives of The Beatles - Iain Softley's Backbeat, released in 1994, dramatised their early career in Hamburg's clubs, where they cut their musical teeth. Sam Taylor-Johnson's Nowhere Boy in 2009 starred her future husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lennon and Thomas Brodie-Sangster as McCartney. It delved into Lennon's early years and family relationships, and documented him meeting McCartney and Harrison and the band's origins. Martin Scorsese made a factual film in 2011 called George Harrison: Living in the Material World, which included contributions from the surviving band members plus archive material. In 2021, Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson restored more than 50 hours of outtakes from 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be for Get Back, a three-part film. The epic Disney+ movie, which was nearly seven hours long, shed new light on the relationship between McCartney and Lennon before the band split in 1970.

        "content": "A Cornell University graduate student who had his US visa revoked due to protest activities against Israel has chosen to leave the US rather than be deported. Momodou Taal, who is a joint citizen of the UK and The Gambia, had his student visa revoked due to his on-campus protest activities last year as the Israel-Gaza war raged. Mr Taal previously sued to block his deportation, but on Monday posted on X that he had chosen to leave the country \"free and with my head held high\". It comes after a judge had denied his request to delay his deportation. The Trump administration is cracking down on international students who have been active in protests against Israel on university campuses.  Mr Taal is at least the second international student to opt to leave the US after being targeted for removal by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Trump administration identifies these cases as \"self-deportations\". \"Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favourable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs,\" Mr Taal posted on X on Monday. \"I have lost faith I could walk the streets without being abducted. Weighing up these options. I took the decision to leave on my own terms.\" A DHS official later confirmed that Mr Taal had departed the US, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Mr Taal was suspended twice by Cornell, an Ivy League school in upstate New York, due to protest activities. On the day of the Hamas attack against Israel in 2023, he posted: \"Glory to the Resistance.\" \"We are in solidarity with the armed resistance in Palestine from the river to the sea,\" he later told a crowd of protesters, according to The Cornell Daily Sun, external newspaper.  At least 300 university students had their student visas revoked due to involvement in pro-Palestinian protests, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week.  Trump officials said the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the State Department to deport non-citizens who are \"adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests\" of the US. The arrests are a part of Trump's pledge to combat what the administration has classified as antisemitism, which was written into an executive order in January. Critics have decried the deportations as a violation of free speech. Another student who chose to flee the US, Indian scholar Ranjani Srinivasan, told CNN that she wants to clear her name. \"I'm not a terrorist sympathiser,\" she told CNN, adding: \"I'm literally just a random student.\" She added that she hopes to re-enrol at Columbia University, which was the epicentre of student protests last year, and finish her PhD programme.

        "title": "NHS billions wasted as bipolar patients left ‘forgotten and failed’",
        "content": "When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose Failing to properly diagnose and treat people with bipolar disorder, external is wasting billions of pounds a year in the UK, according to new data shared exclusively with the BBC. Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are \"ghosts in the system\", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs. Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis. When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a \"deep low\". \"I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on,\" she says. \"They said my symptoms weren't that serious.\"  When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic. A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose. It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly. \"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%,\" she says. It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder. Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are \"undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them\". The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which may make their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists. Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated Â£9.6bn a year. That equates to more than Â£300 per taxpayer. This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care.  But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis. \"This nearly Â£10bn figure is actually quite conservative,\" says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number. \"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial.\" The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work, with some claiming benefits in the UK. For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts. Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: \"If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money.\" According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition. Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCPsych and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is \"completely treatable\" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors. \"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK.\" She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut \"the cost to society\" as well as reducing \"the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes\". It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis. Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: \"Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised. \"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly.\" Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s. \"I was utterly delusional,\" she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found. Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown. She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her. Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time. \"I was failed,\" she says. \"I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs â energetic, grandiose language, erratic â but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned.\" The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point. Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs. They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis. Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes. \"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health.\" However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all. Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with \"less florid manic episodes\" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis. \"There's a high threshold of referral,\" Prof Chew Graham says. \"People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services\". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected. \"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck\". Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care. \"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities. \"It's a tragedy.\" An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions.  \"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care. \"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand â this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines.\" The Department of Health and Social Care says it has already announced Â£26 million to open new mental health crisis centres and it will recruit 8,500 mental health workers to cut waiting times and provide faster treatment.

        "content": "Mourners gathered at a funeral on Monday after the bodies of 15 people, including paramedics and a UN worker, were found in a mass grave, according to the UN The US has said it expects \"all parties on the ground\" in Gaza to comply with international humanitarian law but declined to confirm whether it was carrying out its own assessment into the killing by the Israeli military of 15 people - paramedics, civil defence workers and a UN official. Asked about the killings, state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said: \"Every single thing that happens in Gaza is happening because of Hamas.\" The UN's humanitarian agency has said five ambulances, a fire truck and a UN vehicle were struck \"one by one\" on 23 March and that 15 bodies, including paramedics still in their uniforms, had been gathered and buried in a mass grave. Red Cross outraged over killing of medics by Israeli forces in Gaza Israel orders evacuation of southern Gaza city of Rafah Why has Israel bombed Gaza and what next for ceasefire deal?  The Israeli military said its troops had fired on vehicles \"advancing suspiciously\" without headlights or emergency signals and that a Hamas operative and other militants were among those killed, but it did not offer any comment on the accounts of bodies being gathered up and buried in the sand.  International humanitarian law prohibits the targeting of civilians and calls for specific protections for medical personnel. The US, Israel's biggest arms supplier, is also bound by its own laws prohibiting its weapons being used by foreign militaries in breach of humanitarian law. Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN's humanitarian agency in Gaza, said the mass grave had been \"marked\" with an emergency light from one of the ambulances hit in the strike. \"It's an absolute horror what has happened here,\" he said in a video on X, adding that \"healthcare workers should never be a target\". Israel renewed its air and ground campaign in Gaza on 18 March after negotiations over a ceasefire deal with Hamas stalled. More than 1,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 50,350 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the health ministry.

        "title": "Israel orders evacuation of southern Gaza city of Rafah",
        "content": "Displaced Palestinians started fleeing Rafah on foot and in vehicles after the evacuation order was issued The Israeli military has issued a sweeping new evacuation order for the southern Gaza Strip - the biggest since its offensive in the Palestinian territory resumed earlier this month. The military instructed residents of the city of Rafah and parts of neighbouring Khan Younis to leave immediately for the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, warning that its forces were \"returning to intense operations to dismantle the capabilities of the terrorist organisations\" in the areas. Palestinians who had returned to their homes in Rafah during the recent two-month-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas are now starting to flee. About a fifth of Gaza is now covered by evacuation orders. The UN human rights office warned last week that the evacuations failed to comply with the requirements of international law, accusing Israel of not taking any measures to provide accommodation for those affected or ensuring satisfactory hygiene, health, safety and nutrition conditions. Israel's government said it was evacuating civilians to protect them from Hamas fighters, who it accused of using them as human shields in violation of international law. The Israeli military has also previously insisted it is doing everything it can to limit civilian casualties. Israel renewed its air and ground campaign against Hamas on 18 March, blaming the Palestinian armed group for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the ceasefire and free the 59 hostages still held captive in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of violating the original deal they had agreed in January. More than 1,000 people across Gaza have been killed since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The UN says food and medical supplies are also running out for the 2.1 million population because Israel has also blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid to the territory since 2 March. Israel launched its first major operation in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, last May, leaving large parts of it in ruins. However, tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during the ceasefire. During their previous operation in Rafah, Israeli forces seized a strategic buffer zone along the border with Egypt and did not withdraw from it as called for in the ceasefire agreement. Israel said it needed to maintain a presence there to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza, and Hamas rearming. Displaced Rafah resident Haifa Duhair said she was forced to flee on foot with her baby daughter and three other young children on Monday because no transport was available. \"We went home two months ago... even though the house is destroyed, with shrapnel in it and the windows broken,\" she told Reuters news agency. \"[My] girl was born in the tent, and today they ordered the displacement for all of Rafah,\" she added. \"Half of our children walked in front of us and the other half stayed with us. May God help us.\" Meanwhile, further deadly air strikes were reported across Gaza as the Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas. Eight people, including three children and two women, were killed when a house was hit in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, in the north, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. Footage from a hospital in Khan Younis also showed a young boy among several people killed. The Israeli military said troops carrying out operations to expand the \"security perimeter\" in northern and central Gaza had dismantled a 1km-long underground tunnel belonging to Hamas and eliminated more than 50 \"terrorists\". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 50,350 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's health ministry.

        "title": "Single parents hit hardest by 'awful April' bill rises",
        "content": "A series of essential household bills are rising at the start of April, with warnings that single parents are among the hardest hit. Water bills, energy prices and council tax are all going up on Tuesday , although the minimum wage is also increasing. The charity Citizens Advice said the finances of millions of people on the lowest incomes were \"already stretched to breaking point\". Many single parents in particular would struggle because a greater proportion of their money was taken up by essential spending, it said. Laura Roan, a single mother of two daughters from Cardiff, said: \"Without my own mum helping, there would be some days when I would not have any electric.\" The 41-year-old, who works part-time in Asda, is using emergency credit on her energy meter and regularly dips into her overdraft. Read more on the April bill rises Three ways to cushion the blow of bill rises Will I have have to pay more for water? How much is council tax going up? Why are gas and electricity bills rising and can I fix?  Car tax to broadband - seven bills going up in April How much is the minimum wage increasing by? Laura says her family brings her joy but finances are stretched \"I got paid last Friday and it has all gone. I just live day to day.\" She said her five-year-old daughter Prudence brought her joy and often took her mind off the financial challenges they faced. Those challenges are increasing as a host of price rises kick in. The costs of a TV licence, car tax, and broadband and phone bills are among those going up in cost. Among the changes:  Water bills for households are going up in England and Wales by Â£10 more per month on average, although it varies considerably by supplier, and by almost 10% in Scotland The annual energy bill for a household in England, Wales and Scotland on a variable tariff and using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by Â£111 a year to Â£1,849 Council tax bills in England are generally going up by 4.99%, with bills in Wales rising by about 4.5% to 9.5%, and in Scotland by at least 8% \"After years of cost-of-living pressures, households across the country are about to feel the extra shock of rising essential bills,\" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. The charity said households in the lowest 10% for income were already spending around two fifths (41%) of their earnings - after housing - on water, energy, broadband and car insurance bills. That was a considerably bigger proportion than those on higher incomes. The seven bills going up this week Three ways to cushion the blow of bill rises How much is council tax going up in April? Single-adult households, and particularly those with children, were more likely than others to be spending 20% or more of their post-housing income on these bills, leaving them more exposed to price shocks, it said. John Paine is a single dad with three autistic children aged between five and eight. He said he had Â£100 left over at the end of the month when all the bills were paid. \"It goes quickly,\" he said, with a school trip, a picnic or a day out usually taking up a big chunk of that spending money. \"It means we do not go out very much,\" he said. Official figures, external show that a fifth of families do not have any savings, leaving them at risk. Dozens of people have got in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News to tell us of their experiences. Among them is Bradley Bayton-Harvey, who lives with his partner Ange in Dudley. They have three girls, including three-year-old Darcie-Mai. Both have full-time jobs with the NHS. Bradley Bayton-Harvey says family time can be affected \"We both work nearly 200 hours a month, and it is still a stretch. We're rejiggling finances again and again,\" he said. \"If we can try to get any additional shifts in our rest days to get that extra income, it's frustrating because those rest days should be family time.  \"You shouldn't have to turn around to your kids and say that you can't afford to go on holiday.\" Benefits and the state pension are going up in a week's time. Wages have also been rising at a faster pace than the rate of inflation, and the start of April also brings an increase in the minimum wage. It means: The minimum wage for over-21s, known officially as the National Living Wage, has now risen by 6.7%, from Â£11.44 to Â£12.21 an hour. For someone working full time, or a 37.5-hour week, that equates to Â£23,873.60 a year, up from Â£22,368.06 For 18 to 20-year-olds, the minimum wage has gone up from Â£8.60 to Â£10 an hour. This means someone on a 37.5-hour week would earn Â£19,552 a year, up from Â£16,815. However only a minority of people in this age group do work full time Apprentices are now being paid Â£7.55 an hour, up from Â£6.40. That means their annual wage is going up to Â£14,762 from Â£12,513 In addition, experts say there are ways to cut costs to keep household bills as low as possible. \"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to Â£235,\" said Emily Seymour, from the consumer group Which?.  \"It's also worth checking if you're eligible for any council tax reductions or exemptions and could save money by installing a water meter.\" Some of the UK's biggest banks have also said they would pro-actively contact customers they believed were struggling financially to offer assistance. The government said the rise in wages, as well as a freeze on fuel duty and other policies, were giving workers more money in their pockets.  However, the Conservatives said that benefit will be \"wiped out\" by the increase to employers' national insurance contributions, while the Liberal Democrats said they were \"very disappointed\" with Labour's approach on the economy so far. Reform UK has previously said it would impose taxes on the renewable energy sector, blaming net-zero for higher energy bills. The Green Party said it would introduce a wealth tax.

        "title": "Trump tariffs: Ireland expected to be among hardest hit countries",
        "content": "Trump said his tariff policy is aimed at protecting businesses and boosting manufacturing in the US Ireland is expected to be one of the most affected countries when President Trump announces a new round of tariffs later this week. EU goods are expected to face a tariff of about 20% when entering the United States. Among EU countries, Ireland is the most reliant on the US as an export market. In 2024, Irish goods exports to the US were worth â¬73bn (Â£61bn), almost a third of the country's total exports. Tariffs are effectively taxes applied to goods imported from other countries. Governments impose tariffs in the hope of protecting local manufacturers from international competition. The Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said on Monday that increased US tariffs were \"a very grave and serious threat\". Analysis co-authored by Ireland's Department of Finance and the ESRI think tank suggested the tariffs could cost Ireland more than â¬18bn (Â£15bn) in lost trade. It also warned that a prolonged trade war between the EU and US would pose a risk to Ireland's public finances. The level of concern in Ireland as the tariff's announcement draws closer can be gauged by the level of public interest in the issue. Many Irish towns and cities have enjoyed the benefits of a US business presence for decades, while the workers who are employed in these big businesses travel to the plants from all over Ireland, meaning that the impact of any tariffs could reach into countless communities all over the country. Martin McVicar, of Combilift, visited Chicago in March to brief his US customers Monaghan-based manufacturer Combilift makes about a quarter of its sales in the US market where it also employs 50 people. The company's co-founder and managing director Martin McVicar visited Chicago in March to brief his US customers. He told them he will freeze the dollar price of all Combilift products this year to give them some certainty about import costs. \"We've given our customers certainty on what their costs will be in US dollars for products delivered to the port in the US. \"At least they can try to plan their business around that at this stage.\" Combilift's forklifts can operate in tight spaces, small enough to help companies store more in warehouses Mr McVicar remains bullish about the US market as he sees their products as helping customers run their businesses more efficiently. Combilift makes forklifts which can operate in very tight spaces which allow companies to store more in their warehouses. \"We're enabling customers to expand without having to relocate and we're adamant that should outweigh the impact of a tariff,\" he said. Ireland's biggest export sector is pharmaceuticals: the country is a major manufacturing hub for US companies like Pfizer and Eli Lilly. In 2024 overall exports of medical and pharmaceutical products rose by â¬22.4bn (Â£18.8bn) or 29% to just under â¬100bn (Â£83.7bn). These products accounted for 45% of all Irish goods exports. Trump has repeatedly expressed his unhappiness at the scale of US pharma manufacturing in Ireland. Last month he said:  \"All of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies, this beautiful island of five million people has got the entire US pharmaceutical industry in its grasp.\" Trump has also talked about imposing specific tariffs on pharma, as he has done for imports of cars. However that is not expected to form part of this immediate round of tariffs. Analysis: John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor Ireland has been one of the winners of globalisation - that long process which has made it easier for people, goods and money to flow around the world. Reforms to global tax rules over the last decade have been particularly beneficial. That has led to major international pharmaceutical and technology companies paying a large chunk of their taxes in Ireland. So much money has flowed in that the government has been able to set up a national wealth fund. Donald Trump's deglobalising instincts are a clear threat to that prosperity. Dan O'Brien said parallels could be drawn with the 2008 economic crash Dan O'Brien, chief economist of the Institute of International and European Affairs, believes the Irish economy could be exposed because of the success of the pharmaceutical sector there. \"The republic is the single biggest exporter of pharmaceuticals to the United States. With a population of just over five million that makes it a bigger exporter than even the likes of traditional powerhouses like Germany and Switzerland,\" he said. Mr O'Brien added the potential impact of the tariffs on Ireland could have parallels with the country's economic crash in 2008. \"Then there was a financial crisis, it was immediate, it was like the wind blew the roof off the house,\" he said.  \"In this case it's more like a more gradual erosion of the foundations, which obviously is very important for any structure.\" Irish finance minister delivers warning over US tariffs Irish goods exports to US surge by 34% Trump targets Irish pharmaceutical industry for US tariffs If the people of the country were not quite sure what the implication of the changes might be, the Irish government has left them in no doubt in recent weeks. In a sobering analysis, the Minister for Finance, Pascal Donohoe, who is renowned for his cautious style of commentary around economic matters, outlined the possible outcome for Ireland in the worst-case scenario. The minister, who is also president of the Eurogroup of Finance Ministers, said: \"It is very possible that between 50,000 and 80,000 jobs that would have been created or kept within the economy won't be.\" This sobering analysis has been accompanied by transatlantic and EU diplomatic discussions involving the Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, and the TÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Harris. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? US tariffs 'potentially devastating' for Irish whiskey Threat of US tariffs spells uncertainty for NI businesses The scale of Ireland's dependency on foreign direction investment involving the US has been explained by Ireland's Industrial Development Authority (IDA). An IDA spokesperson told BBC News NI: \"IDA Ireland partners with more than 1,800 FDI client companies, 766 of which are US companies that directly employ over 210,000 people and indirectly support an additional 166,000 jobs. \"Conversely, Ireland is the sixth largest source of foreign direct investment into the US, with investment by Irish companies in 2023 worth $351bn (Â£272bn).  \"More than 200,000 people are employed by 770 Irish companies across all 50 States.\" Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "content": "Ms Giuffre, who has been living in Australia, said she had collided with a school bus Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers, has said she is in hospital following a serious accident. Ms Giuffre posted on Instagram that she had suffered kidney failure after her car collided with a school bus, stating doctors had given her \"four days to live\" and were transferring her to a specialist hospital. In a statement shared with the BBC, her spokesperson Dini von Mueffling said: \"Virginia has been in a serious accident and is receiving medical care in the hospital. She greatly appreciates the support and well wishes people are sending.\" Ms Giuffre said this year had \"been the worst\", alongside a photograph from a hospital bed showing visible bruising. The 41-year-old described the accident in an Instagram post, external, writing that the crash was so severe that her car \"might as well be a tin can\". \"I'm ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time,\" she added, seemingly referring to her three children. Ms Giuffre had recently been living with her children and husband Robert in the suburb of North Perth, Australia, though recent reports suggest the couple have split after 22 years of marriage. It remains unclear where and when the crash occurred. Both the Western Australia police and ambulance services told the BBC they had no records of such an accident happening in recent weeks. The police later specified that they had located records of a \"minor crash\" between a bus and a car on 24 March, but that no injuries had been reported as a result. Ms Giuffre is best known for her allegations that Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell trafficked her to the Duke of York when she was 17.  Prince Andrew has denied all claims but reached an out-of-court settlement with her in 2022.  The settlement included a statement in which he expressed regret for his association with Epstein but contained no admission of liability or apology.

        "title": "Zimbabwe protest: Harare shuts down as Blessed Geza calls for Emmerson Mnangagwa to resign",
        "content": "The authorities had warned that any protests would not be tolerated A national protest meant to pressure Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa to resign turned into a shutdown as citizens opted to stay away rather than take to the streets amid a heavy security presence. Only a handful of protesters took part in the planned march, spearheaded by a group of disgruntled war veterans who have accused Mnangagwa of corruption and wanting to cling on to power, and they were dispersed by the police. Following the reports of a low turnout, protest leader Blessed Geza urged Zimbabweans \"not to be cowards\" in a post on X. Mnangagwa became president in 2017 following a coup against long-time leader Robert Mugabe and is currently serving his second and final term. A man called Bombshell fires up Zimbabwe's succession battle The Zimbabwean agitator unfazed by serial arrests  Geza, who wants Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga to replace Mnangagwa, had previously called for Zimbabweans to \"fill the streets\" in a final push to force the president to step down.  Numerous videos were shared on social media throughout the day. In one, police can be seen using tear gas to disperse a crowd gathered at President Robert Mugabe Square in Harare. In another, a woman details the police's efforts to clamp down on what was regarded as a \"peaceful protest\" as she vowed \"we're not going anywhere, we're going to stay here\". \"I am 63 and life is tough... I am taking care of my grandchildren because my children cannot afford to,\" a protester on crutches also told local media house Citizens Voice Network. \"We want General [Constantine] Chiwenga to take over,\" she added. Zimbabweans have largely stayed away from a protest aimed at toppling President Emmerson Mnangagwa The vice-president has not commented publicly about the calls for him to replace  Mnangagwa and government officials deny there is a rift between the two men. Reacting to Monday's low turnout, Farai Murapira from the governing Zanu-PF party, said social media was not a reflection of reality. But political scientist Ibbo Mandaza said those disparaging the turnout were wrong. \"The shutdown was a massive political statement,\" he said. Across various cities and towns, the majority of businesses were shuttered and streets were empty of the usual bustle of street vendors and choking traffic. Schools closed and public transport was scarce as fearful residents opted to steer clear of the potential chaos.  The police tightened security, mounting roadblocks into Harare and carrying out patrols on foot and trucks in the city centre throughout the day. They were also seen removing the stones, and cement blocks thrown by protesters. The country's clergy has since called for cool heads, as it warned that unrest could destabilise an already fragile country. A petrol station attendant told the BBC in a hushed voice that ordinary people did not want the country to slide into civil war.  At the heart of the recent protest is a reported plan by the president to extend his final term by two years to 2030. Mnangagwa's second term expires in 2028. The slogan \"2030 he will still be the leader\" has been shared by his supporters even though Zimbabwe's constitution limits presidential terms to two five-year terms. Despite a recent assurance from the president that he did intend to step down in three years, many remain unconvinced. This has angered Geza, a veteran of the 1970s war of liberation and former senior Zanu-PF member, who has led a verbal attack on Mnangagwa. In a series of often expletive-laden press conferences, gritty-voiced and with a furrowed forehead, he repeatedly called on the 82-year-old president to go or face being removed.

        "title": "Has the government really 'returned' 24,000 people?",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer has highlighted his government efforts to tackle illegal immigration, saying: \"We've returned more than 24,000 people who have no right to be here.\"  He was speaking at an international summit in London aimed at tackling people-smuggling gangs.  The Home Office has also posted a video on X, showing people being escorted onto planes by immigration enforcement officials, with the words: \"we have removed more than 24,000 people\". But the claim is misleading. The government's latest figures show that only 6,339 of these were \"enforced returns\"., external The majority were \"voluntary returns\" - and a significant number of these happen without the government's direct involvement or even knowledge. The Home Office says all returns outcomes are the result of collective efforts by the department - we asked it for a full breakdown of its latest figures which it has not provided. Allow X content?

You may want to read Xâs cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose âaccept and continueâ. The Home Office records \"returns\" of people who have no legal right to be in the UK. This could be because they have entered illegally - on a small boat for example - or have overstayed their visa or are subject to deportation action because of a criminal conviction. Returns are classified as \"enforced\" or \"voluntary\". An enforced return might require an immigration officer to escort an individual on to a flight to ensure that they have left the UK. Some voluntary returns involve government assistance, for example individuals can have their flight paid for and get up to Â£3,000 towards resettlement costs. But in other voluntary returns, people leave the UK independently without the government's knowledge at the time. These departures may only come to light later, through checks against visa or flight records, for example. These are called \"other verified\" - or independent - returns. We asked the Home Office for a full breakdown of the 24,000 figure used by the prime minister to see how many of these returns fall into this last category.  It was not able to provide this.  However, we can look back at the last full set of published returns figures which cover the period between July (when Labour came to power) and December 2024. Over this period there were 17,300 returns. Out of this overall figure, 6,150 returns (35%) were categorised as \"other verified\" - in order words, individuals who left the UK without notifying the government. This was the largest single returns category. As the above chart shows, after 'independent'  the next largest category was 'enforced' at 26%. The remaining categories are 'assisted' (25%) - where a person leaves as part of a Home Office scheme and 'controlled' (14%) - where a person either leaves at their own expense and tells officials before they go, or where the Home Office oversees their departure A recent report by the Migration Observatory, University of Oxford said: \"It is unclear to what extent, if at all, government activity and policy affects the number of people returning independently (as opposed to other factors like economic conditions).\" \"There are many evidence and data gaps that make it difficult to get a full picture of deportations and returns\", it added.  Fragmented policing on small boats was exploited, says PM How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Government considering sending failed asylum seekers to Balkans However, ministers and Labour MPs have repeatedly implied that the government is actively involved in all returns of immigration offenders. Claims using an overall returns figure and either the words \"removed\" or \"returned\" have been made in interviews, in Parliament and on social media at least 20 times in recent months. And Border Security minister Dame Angela Eagle said on 31 March: \"We have already deported â sent home â 19,000 people with no right to be here.\" We asked the Home Office how the government can claim credit for individuals who leave of their own accord and without it being aware of their departure at the time.  It said it has both a direct and an indirect role in returns and pointed to wider measures that discourage and prevent immigration offending. On its social media posts showing people being escorted onto planes, it says these are illustrative and the public will understand that ways of offenders leaving the country will vary considerably. The returns figures also reveal that 1,053 people who arrived in the UK on small boats were returned over the July to December period. The number includes both enforced and voluntary returns. In the same period, 23,242 people arrived on small boats. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?

        "title": "Bodies of three missing US soldiers found in Lithuania",
        "content": "It reportedly took about two hours and several heavy military and construction vehicles to pull the M88A2 Hercules vehicle from the peat bog The bodies of three US soldiers, missing for six days, have been found in a muddy swamp near the Lithuanian city of PabradÄ, where they were taking part in military drills, the US Army has confirmed. Rescue teams are still searching for a fourth soldier.  \"The soldiers we have lost in this tragedy were not just soldiers - they were a part of our family... But the search isn't finished until everyone is home\", said Maj Gen Christopher Norrie in a statement issued by US Army Europe and Africa. The complex search and rescue mission has included the US Army and Navy, plus Lithuanian and Polish Armed Forces in an effort that has required \"tremendous resources\", the statement said. The four soldiers went missing on the morning of 25 March while carrying out an exercise in their M88A2 Hercules - a large armoured vehicle that is designed to recover damaged tanks and other vehicles from battlefields. They were \"conducting a mission to repair and tow an immobilised tactical vehicle\" when they went missing, the statement said. The soldiers' vehicle was found submerged in a bog near the border with Belarus early on 26 March. Pulling it out of the mud was a difficult mission. US Navy divers were brought in to hook cables onto the sunken vehicle, and had to manoeuvre \"through thick layers of mud, clay, and sediment with zero visibility\", the statement said. Those cables were then connected to another two M88A2 Hercules, which also started to slide into the bog, leading to several bulldozers being called on. Other heavy construction equipment including excavators and sluice and slurry pumps were brought in, as well as technical experts and \"several hundred tons of gravel and earth\", the US Army said. On Sunday, soldiers, military commanders and Lithuania's defence minister attended a mass that was held in the capital city, Vilnius. \"Lithuania mourns together with the American nation,\" the country's President Gitanas NausÄda wrote on X.  \"Please accept my heartfelt condolences, as well as those of the Lithuanian people, to you, the loved ones of those who lost their lives, and all the people of the United States of America,\" he said, addressing US President Donald Trump. The M88A2 Hercules recovery vehicle, like this one pictured in Denmark, is used to hoist, winch and tow heavy military combat vehicles, like tanks, that need repair in hostile environments such as war zones Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, is the base for more than 1,000 American troops stationed on rotation. The identities of the four soldiers, who were assigned to the 1st Armoured Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, have been withheld until their next of kin are informed. They had been deployed to Lithuania as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Their home base is Fort Stewart, in the US state of Georgia.

        "title": "Can Trump serve a third term as US president?",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said he is \"not joking\" about wanting to serve a third term as US president.  The US Constitution says that \"no person... shall be elected more than twice\", but some Trump supporters have suggested there could be ways around that. Trump was asked in an interview with NBC about the possibility of seeking a third term and said \"there are methods which you could do it\".  \"I'm not joking... a lot of people want me to do it,\" he added. \"But, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\" Trump, who would be 82 at the end of his second term, was asked whether he would want to keep serving in \"the toughest job in the country\". \"Well, I like working,\" he replied. These were not his first comments on the topic. In January, he told supporters that it would be \"the greatest honour of my life to serve not once, but twice or three times or four times\". However, he then said this was a joke for the \"fake news media\". On the face of it, the US Constitution seems to rule out anyone having a third term. The 22nd Amendment states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice, and no person who has held the office of president, or acted as president, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once.\" Changing the constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country's state-level governments.  Trump's Republican Party controls both chambers of Congress but does not have the majorities needed. Additionally, the Democratic Party controls 18 of the 50 state legislatures. This video can not be played Watch: Trump says he would 'love' to run a third term against Barack Obama Trump supporters say there is a loophole in the constitution, untested in court.  They argue that the 22nd Amendment only explicitly bans someone being \"elected\" to more than two presidential terms - and says nothing of \"succession\". Under this theory, Trump could be the vice-presidential running-mate to another candidate - perhaps his own vice-president, JD Vance - in the 2028 election. If they win, the candidate could be sworn into the White House and then immediately resign - letting Trump take over by succession. Steve Bannon, the podcaster and prominent former Trump adviser,  said he believed Trump would \"run and win again\", adding there were \"a couple of alternatives\" in determining how. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican in the House of Representatives, introduced a resolution in January calling for a constitutional amendment to allow a president to serve up to three terms - as long as they were not consecutive.  This would mean that only Trump of all living presidents would be eligible - Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W Bush all served consecutive terms, whereas Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020, and won again in 2024. However, the high bar for constitutional amendments makes Ogles' proposal a pipe dream - although it got people talking. A quick guide to Donald Trump Chosen ones â nine people trusted to deliver for Trump What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Trump blew up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling Democrats have deep objections. \"This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy,\" said Daniel Goldman, a New York Representative who served as lead counsel for Trump's first impeachment.  \"If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump's ambitions for a third term.\"  Some within Trump's party also think it's a bad idea. The Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin, of Oklahoma, said in February he would not back an attempt to put Trump back in the White House. \"I'm not changing the constitution, first of all, unless the American people chose to do that,\" Mullin told NBC. Derek Muller, an election law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said the Constitution's 12th Amendment says \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States\". That means serving two terms in office disqualifies anyone from running as a vice-presidential candidate, in his view. \"I don't think there's any 'one weird trick' to getting around presidential term limits,\" he said. Jeremy Paul, a constitutional law professor at Boston's Northeastern University, told CBS New there were \"no credible legal arguments\" for a third term. Roosevelt is the only US president to serve more than two terms Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected four times. He died three months into his fourth term, in April 1945. The Great Depression and the Second World War coloured Roosevelt's time in office - and are often cited for his extended presidency.  At that time, the two-term limit on US presidents had not been written into law - it was instead a custom followed since George Washington refused a third term in 1796. Roosevelt's extended stewardship led to the tradition being codified into law in the 22nd Amendment in 1951.

        "title": "Birmingham City Council declares major incident over bin strike",
        "content": "Rubbish has been piling up on Birmingham streets for almost a month A major incident has been declared by Birmingham City Council over the ongoing bin strike, which has left 17,000 tonnes of waste on the streets.  Leader John Cotton said it was in response to concerns for public health as the authority struggles to clear the rubbish, which has led to the issue being raised in Parliament. Its declaration means the council can increase its street cleaning operation and fly-tipping removal, by bringing in an extra 35 vehicles and crews.  Unite union members have been on all-out strike since 11 March in a row over pay, and over this latest move bosses accused the council of being \"hellbent on imposing\" its plan for salary cuts and demotions. Residents in many areas of the city say they have had enough of seeing mountains of rubbish piling up, and are asking questions as to why some areas are apparently seeing bins being emptied while others are not. As the strike was being raised in the House of Commons, the government said it was \"monitoring the situation closely\". Mr Cotton said a lot of the difficulty in clearing the waste in the streets had been caused by staff on picket lines who, he said, were preventing vehicles from getting out of depot. Birmingham City Council said 17,000 tonnes of waste had gone uncollected due to the strike It was \"regrettable\" the council had to take this step, Mr Cotton said. \"[But] we cannot tolerate a situation that is causing harm and distress to communities across Birmingham,\" he said. \"I respect the right to strike and protest, however actions on the picket line must be lawful and sadly the behaviour of some now means we are seeing a significant impact on residents and the city's environment. \"Unless we declare a major incident and deploy the waste service's contingency plan, then we would be unable to clear the backlog of waste on the streets.\" Talks between the council and Unite broke down at the end of last week, after no agreement was reached in the all-out strike, which began on 11 March Declaring the major incident also allows the Labour-run council to \"work with partners to better manage the risks the city is facing\", which could include increased sharing of data. Further support from neighbouring councils and the government could also be explored, the authority said. Why are Birmingham bin workers on strike? Tories call for government action over bin strike Union hopes over bin strike redundancy plans Speaking in the House of Commons, local government minister Jim McMahon said \"well-established arrangements\" were in place in the city. \"If local leaders on the ground in Birmingham feel that tackling these issues goes beyond the resources available to them and they request national support, then of course we stand ready to respond,\" he said. \"This government will always back local leaders and give them the support that they need.\" However, Kevin Hollinrake, shadow local government secretary, accused the Labour government of being in \"total denial\" and said declaring a major incident was not enough. The move came after the Conservatives wrote to ministers to hold urgent talks and send in \"strike-busting private rubbish collectors to help clean up the rat-infested rubbish covered streets\". Unite said it was \"determined\" to find a resolution to the ongoing strike action Negotiations between the council and Unite were held on Thursday but broke down, with the authority saying all offers on the table had been rejected. In response, the council said it had launched a period of collective consultation regarding compulsory redundancies. Unite claims planned restructuring of the refuse service will see some 50 workers lose Â£8,000 a year, and about 20 lose Â£2,000 per annum. Sharon Graham, its general secretary, said that instead of declaring a major incident, the authority could easily resolve the dispute but instead was \"hellbent on imposing its plan of demotions and pay cuts at all costs\". \"We can only conclude that this massive pay cut for hundreds of refuse workers is only the start and this is really about stamping out any future opposition to its plans to unleash austerity 2.0 on Birmingham,\" Ms Graham said. \"I urge Birmingham council to rethink this disastrous strategy and to find a way forward that doesn't involve workers and communities having to pay for politicians' mistakes.\" Residents of the Small Heath area of the city told BBC Midlands Today they were fed up with the worsening conditions. Ian Cook, who lives on Henshaw Road, said he has had to keep his windows closed because of the smell. Pointing to the pile of rubbish on his street, he said: \"We didn't have any rats until this lot appeared. Now we've got them having parties on the grass.\" Basmin Khan, of the Small Heath Forum, said the mounting rubbish piles were becoming a \"health hazard\" Basmin Khan, from Small Heath Forum, said: \"There have been rats going under the cars, going into the bins, going into the front gardens â it's a health hazard.\" She said there were parts of Birmingham where rubbish was being collected and that questions needed to be asked over why Small Heath was being ignored. Naeem Yusuf, another Small Heath Forum member, said people were \"getting depressed\" around the area. \"We've had a lot of people complaining that we don't want to open the front doors now because of the stench that these bags are bringing out,\" he said.

        "content": "Tai Woffinden, 34, suffered multiple injuries at a race meeting in Poland on Sunday A three-time speedway world champion is in a medically induced coma after a crash in Poland, according to team officials. Tai Woffinden, from Scunthorpe, had been racing for his club Rzeszow on Sunday when he was involved in a collision with a teammate. In a statement, club officials said Woffinden was taken by helicopter to hospital where he underwent surgery after suffering multiple fractures and an injury to his chest. The 34-year-old has been placed into a medically-induced coma on a ventilator and is in a stable condition in intensive care, the club confirmed. Woffinden had only recently made a comeback to the sport after he suffered a broken elbow in June which ended his 2024 season. In addition to racing in Poland, he was due back in the UK to ride for the Sheffield Tigers in the British Speedway Premiership against Birmingham on Thursday. The South Yorkshire club has asked fans not to share rumours about the crash \"out of respect for Tai and his family\". Woffinden is one of Britain's most decorated speedway riders after winning three Grand Prix world titles Woffinden is one of the country's most decorated racers after winning three Grand Prix world titles in 2013, 2015 and 2018. He also finished runner-up in 2016 and 2020. Rob Godfrey, the promoter of the Scunthorpe Scorpions where Woffinden started his career in 2006, said the \"speedway world will be hoping for a speedy recovery\". He said: \"I spoke to him last week and he was so focussed on his racing. \"This was going to be a rebuilding year to get back to the world championships in 2026 so it's bitterly disappointing. \"Every time these riders get on a bike they put themselves on the line. Hopefully he will recover from it and be ok again.\" Woffinden previously rode for Wolverhampton Wolves. In a social media post the club said: \"Wishing our Wolf World Champion, Tai Woffinden, a full and speedy recovery. \"Your strength, determination, and spirit continue to inspire us all  - we're right behind you every step of the way. \"Stay strong, Tai.\" Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

The boy's body was discovered inside a Marks & Spencer bag outside All Saints' Church, off Talbot Road, in Notting Hill last Tuesday. The woman, believed to be the baby's mother, was detained on Saturday on suspicion of concealing a birth, neglect and infanticide, the Metropolitan Police said.

        "content": "Loch Ness expert Adrian Shine said it was remarkable that the camera had survived 55 years in the loch An underwater camera set up 55 years ago to try and photograph the Loch Ness Monster has been found by accident by a robot submarine. The ocean-going yellow sub - called Boaty McBoatface - was being put through trials when its propeller snagged the mooring for the 1970s camera system. It is believed it was lowered 180m (591ft) below the loch's surface by the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, a group set up in the 1960s to uncover the existence of Nessie in the waters. No footage of Nessie has been found on the camera, but one of the submarine's engineers was able to develop a few images of the loch's murky waters. The camera was protected inside a glass container. The camera was put into the loch in the 1970s Boaty McBoatface has been used in trials in Loch Ness Adrian Shine, of The Loch Ness Project - which has been researching the loch since the 1970s, helped to identify the camera. He said it was likely to be one of six deployed. Three were lost in the loch during a gale. Mr Shine said: \"It was an ingenious camera trap consisting of a clockwork Instamatic camera with an inbuilt flash cube, enabling four pictures to be taken when a bait line was taken. \"It is remarkable that the housing has kept the camera dry for the past 55 years, lying more than 130m (426ft) deep in Loch Ness.\" No sign of Nessie was found on the camera's film The film and camera have been handed over to an exhibition centre The UK's National Oceanography Centre (NOC) has been carrying out trials of marine autonomous underwater vehicles for almost 10 years. NOC's Matt Kingsland said: \"At 230m (754ft) deep, Loch Ness is an ideal location to testing our robotics, their sensors and systems, before they're deployed in the deep ocean to help answer the big questions we have. \"While this wasn't a find we expected to make, but we're happy that this piece of Nessie hunting history can be shared and perhaps at least the mystery of who left it in the loch can be solved.\" The film, camera and its housing have been handed to The Loch Ness Centre, in Drumnadrochit, near to where it was found.  A member of the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau works on a film camera in the hills above the loch in 1966 Robot Boaty McBoatface got its name following an online initiative in 2016 in which the public was asked to suggest a name for a new polar ship.

        "title": "Adolescence makers meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Downing Street",
        "content": "Writer Jack Thorne (right) was among those who spoke to Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street The prime minister has told the makers of hit Netflix drama Adolescence that it was \"really hard to watch\" with his teenage children, as he hosted a Downing Street meeting to discuss the influence of toxic material online. Sir Keir Starmer said the show, about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, served as \"a torch that shines intensely brightly on a combination of issues that many people don't know how to respond to\". But he warned there was not a \"silver bullet response\" or \"some policy lever that can be pulled\". Sir Keir also welcomed a move by Netflix to make the series available to screen for free in secondary schools. Adolescence is the first streaming show to top the UK weekly TV ratings The programme has sparked a national conversation about the impact of social media and \"manosphere\" influencers. Jack Thorne, who wrote the show with actor Stephen Graham, recently said the prime minister should \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media. Thorne and producer Jo Johnson gave their views to Sir Keir at Monday's meeting, along with charities including the NSPCC and Children's Society, and young people. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was also there. The prime minister told them the show was \"at times harrowing\" but had \"lit a touch paper\" under the debate about the issues. \"We've been watching with our children - my boy is 16, my girl is 14 - and I have to say, I found it really hard,\" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason. It was so arresting, he said, because \"in a sense, what happens in the drama could really happen anywhere, and almost happen to any child\". It shone a light \"on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn in to this world\", he said. But unlike some things the government deals with, \"there isn't an obvious policy response which will answer all of these questions\", he added. \"It's much broader than that. It's a cultural issue, and therefore we're going to have to look more broadly, work as a society on this, and discuss it, which is why I'm really pleased that Adolescence is now going to be shown in schools free because I do think young people should be watching it.\" Netflix announced that the drama would be available to all UK secondary schools through the Into Film+ schools streaming service. Asked about banning phones in schools, which has also been proposed by the Conservative opposition, he said 97% of schools were already doing that - so it was \"not, to my mind, the central issue\". \"If we're going to get to grips with this, I personally would much rather we focus on what I think is the real issue, which is, whether you're at school or elsewhere, what are you actually accessing? Because that, for me, is the critical issue,\" he said. \"And whether it's at school or elsewhere, there's material that clearly shouldn't be accessed.\" Jack Thorne has called for \"radical\" action by the government The government has pointed to measures including the Online Safety Act, which says social media companies will have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts. Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content. Sir Keir said it was \"an important piece of legislation\", but that \"we should go back and revisit whether there's further work that we need to do to protect young people\". The PM also denied a suggestion that showing the programme in schools would demonise boys who spend a lot of time online but haven't ended up like Jamie in Adolescence. \"I think it's probably wrong to think that there's just a group of boys that are drawn to this [material],\" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. \"Certainly, there's a group that are drawn to the extreme edges of this, and we see that in the drama, of course, but I think many boys would be somewhere, possibly, on a continuum here.\" The government is also updating its guidance on how schools should teach children about relationships, sex and health education (RSHE). The Times recently reported, external that it would include \"lessons to counter misogyny and the growing appeal of influencers such as Andrew Tate\", in the wake of the discussions about Adolescence. Speaking afterwards, Thorne said it was a \"brilliant\" meeting. \"The brilliant thing was that it wasn't about us,\" he said. \"It was about facilitating conversations with charities and youth groups who really understand what's going on, and I hope a solution can be found to this problem.\" The success of Adolescence has helped those charities and groups get \"the opportunity to have conversations that they haven't had before and that they should have had, and that might lead to a policy change and things being made better for our young people\", he added. By Pria Rai and Riyah Collins, BBC Newsbeat For 22-year-old Harry Foster, being radicalised as a teenager was \"very easy\". \"When you're a child, it's very easy when there's a lack of any sort of direction or positive role models to get swept along with something,\" he said. He said extremist groups exploited his vulnerability with addiction issues as a teenager, manipulating him into sharing racist and misogynistic views. \"I thought I was finding some sense of belonging,\" he told Newsbeat. \"What I was actually being given was a very harmful and very radical set of political views, which is almost like the trade-off for belonging to these people.\" He got help through The Warren youth group in Hull and now works with them to help other boys and young men in similar situations. Harry welcomed Sir Keir's plans to work with Netflix to show Adolescence in secondary schools, but said more work must be done. \"I don't think there's ever been a time where young people as a whole feel more disconnected from politicians,\" he said. \"It's one thing to make young men aware of the problems around these kind of ideologies, but it's equally important we're offering an alternative to young boys and men who are so desperately looking for something to identify with. \"I don't think it's as simple as showing a TV show.

        "title": "Donald Trump labels alleged Turnberry vandals 'terrorists'",
        "content": "The Trump Turnberry resort was targeted earlier this month Donald Trump has labelled people accused of vandalising the Trump Turnberry golf resort as \"terrorists\". Grafitti was sprayed on the clubhouse in red paint and the course was dug up and daubed with the words \"Gaza is not for sale\" The US president said those who caused damage at the Ayrshire resort should be \"treated harshly\" by authorities. Kieran Robson, 33, appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court on Monday on a single charge of malicious mischief in connection with the incident. He made no plea and was released on bail.   The case was committed for further examination, with Mr Robson, of Galashiels, set to appear again at a later date. Another man, aged 75, and a 66-year-old woman were previously arrested and released pending further inquiries. In an earlier post on his Truth Social platform, after a conversation with Sir Keir Starmer, Trump incorrectly claimed that \"three people were in prison\" over the incident. He wrote: \"I was just informed by Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom, that they caught the terrorists who attacked the beautiful Turnberry, in Scotland. \"They did serious damage, and will hopefully be treated harshly. \"You cannot let things like this attack happen, and I greatly appreciate the work of Prime Minister Starmer, and UK law enforcement.\" Police were called to the resort, on Maidens Road in the South Ayrshire village, at about 04:40 on 8 March. The incident came after Trump sparked international concern by suggesting he wanted to turn Gaza into a resort, displacing Palestinians in the process. He suggested the US could \"take over\" Gaza following talks with the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump bought Turnberry from a Dubai-based group in 2014. Police Scotland said inquiries into the vandalism were ongoing.

        "title": "French far-right leader Marine Le Pen barred from running for public office for five years",
        "content": "Marine Le Pen has attacked her ban from running for public office for five years as a \"political decision\" by the judge She also accused the court of trying to block her candidacy for the 2027 French presidential election, calling the ban worth of \"authoritarian regimes\" Le Pen was found guilty of embezzling European funds to finance her French far-right National Rally (RN) party Le Pen expected the guilty sentence - but not this ban, writes our correspondent Hugh Schofield in Paris She has also been given a four-year prison sentence - two years will be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody, while the other two are suspended Reacting to the conviction, her lawyer says \"it's a blow to democracy\" and she intends to appeal This video can not be played Watch: Le Pen leaves court before sentencing ends Edited by Rorey Bosotti and Adam Durbin, with Hugh Schofield reporting from Paris Earlier today, Marine Le Pen was found guilty of embezzling European funds to finance her French far-right National Rally (RN) party. In a television interview this evening, she said she would appeal against the move, describing it as  \"political\", and arguing that she was \"innocent\". Le Pen also accused the court of attempting to block her from running for president in the 2027 election and said she would not let herself be \"eliminated\" like this. Le Pen was given a five-year ban on running for office with immediate effect, meaning she's barred from running in the next presidential race, unless her appeal is successful before then. MORE: Le Pen attacks ban from running for public office as 'political decision' She was also handed a â¬100,000 (Â£82,635) fine and a four-year prison sentence - two years of which will be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody, while the other two are suspended. Members of RN have pushed back against the verdict, with some describing it as \"against all principles of law\" and \"an infringement on democracy\". And party president Jordan Bardella called for a \"popular, peaceful mobilisation\" in support of Le Pen. Following these reactions, France's High Council of the Judiciary - a constitutional body formed to ensure judicial independence - called for calm in response to today's ruling and moderation in the comments made about the proceedings.  We'll be ending our live coverage shortly, but for further reading you can take a look at BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield's analysis following the events of the day.  Thanks for joining us. On the streets of Paris, there was mixed reactions to Marine Le Pen's sentencing. Caroline, a graphic designer, told the Reuters news agency that the far-right National Rally (RN) party will continue to exist with or without Le Pen. âIf she doesn't run, someone else will run in her place. For example, in the party, there's what's-his-name, (Jordan) Bardella, there are other people who could run and in my opinion, her party will continue to exist,â she said. Project manager David said the sanctions on Le Pen are OK, but barring her from running is a restriction on voters. âI think we're going too far in the sense that - I think it's OK to sanction, but going as far as ineligibility deprives citizens of the possibility of casting their vote, or votes, to a potential candidate for the next presidential elections - it restricts citizens' ability to express themselves,\" he added. Shortly after Le Pen's interview, France's minister of justice weighed in to condemn threats against the judiciary following her sentencing. \"Threats made against the judges of Parisâs Judicial Court are unacceptable in a democracy and worrying for the independence of the judicial authority,\" GÃ©rald Darmanin writes on X. Le Pen described today's verdict as a \"political decision\" and proclaimed her innocence, arguing the judge in charge of the case had yet to provide an explanation for the ruling. Hugh SchofieldParis correspondent At the end of a momentous day in French politics, Marine Le Pen came out fighting. No, she said, she had no intention of withdrawing from the scene â despite the ineligibility imposed on her by the court. She had spent 30 years fighting injustice and she would keep doing so to the end, Le Pen said. Millions of voters had their hopes vested in her. The leader of the National Rally was found guilty of misusing EU money to pay for party workers, and part of her punishment was to be barred from standing for office with immediate effect. But she said this was a denial of natural justice. She was appealing, and in law an appeal was a new trial â so how could she be punished already? What would happen, she asked, if she was eventually acquitted on appeal after an election in which she was prevented from taking part? What effect would that have on the legitimacy of whoever became the next president? We have now heard Marine Le Pen's reaction to today's unexpected ruling, and from a slew of politicians.  On the streets of HÃ©nin-Beaumont, a far-right stronghold and Le Pen's constituency, voters told the AFP news agency how they see the verdict: In her interview earlier this evening, Marine Le Pen defended herself against today's court decision and insisted she was \"innocent\". Let's recap what else we heard from her: A lawyer for Marine Le Pen says he will formally request that an appeal for his client takes place before 2027, when France's next presidential election will be held. Rodolphe Bosselut also tells broadcaster BFMTV that Le Pen was shocked by the court's decision to ban her from running for office for five years over embezzling EU funds. We're seeing more reaction to Le Pen's sentencing coming in, with the national secretary of the green political party Les Ãcologistes, Marine Tondelier, saying she must serve her sentence \"like any other French citizen\". \"When you lecture others on exemplary behaviour, you must first apply it to yourself. That is what ultimately ensures integrity and the proper functioning of public institutions,\" she says. \"It is therefore normal that someone aspiring to the presidency respects these fundamental principles of integrity. She did not respect them, and the best way to avoid being convicted is not to seek immunity for oneself but to follow the law, to not commit crimes or offences.\" Meanwhile, the Socialist Party also reacted to the verdict earlier today, calling on everyone to \"respect the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law\". \"The Socialist Party remains mobilised to defend republican values ââand transparency in public life, essential to the trust of citizens,\" the party said in a statement. Le Pen says that in a democracy it's \"the voters who decide\". \"Iâm telling you tonight, Iâm not demoralised. Like you, Iâm scandalised, indignant, but this indignation, this feeling of injustice, is an additional push to the fight that I fight for them [the voters],\" she says. And with that the interview has ended. Le Pen is next asked by the interviewer about the prospect of Jordan Bardella - the 29-year-old president of National Rally - running for the 2027 presidential election in her place. Responding, she describes Bardella as a \"wonderful asset for the party\", but says she will not let herself be \"eliminated\" like this. \"There are millions of French people who believe in me. I've been fighting for you for 30 years.\" Le Pen says the judge handed her a five-year ban but has currently not provided any explanation for the decision. She says she will appeal against the verdict \"as soon as possible\" and proclaims that she is \"innocent\". \"This evening, there are millions of French people who are outraged seeing that in France, the country of human rights, judges have implemented measures that are reserved to authoritarian regimes,\" she says. Marine Le Pen is now giving her interview to French broadcaster TF1. She accuses the Paris judge that delivered the guilty verdict against her earlier today of handing down \"a political decision\" - and the court of attempting to block her from running in the 2027 presidential election. Le Pen claims the rule of law was totally violated. Marine Le Pen will make her first public remarks since her conviction and sentencing in a few minutes time.  An interview with her is due to air shortly. We'll be bringing you all the key lines from her interview with French TV outlet TF1 here. Le Pen leaving the RN's headquarters earlier following an emergency party meeting Marine Le Pen is a lawyer and politician who ran\nfor the French presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022. She is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was the\nfounder of France's far-right National Front (FN). She took over the party in 2011 - and in 2015 expelled her father\nover a series of inflammatory remarks and a feud with his daughter. This was in\npart to do with his view that the Holocaust was a \"detail of\nhistory\". In 2018, the party was rebranded as the National Rally (RN). A political player in France for years, Le Pen's message -\nanti-immigration and anti-EU - has been consistent and unchanged. In the lead up to the 2017 election she softened her tone,\nfor example by saying she did not regard Islam as âincompatibleâ with French\ndemocracy. Her party also tried to build bridges with the Jewish community. Le Pen later stepped down as head of RN and in 2022 Jordan\nBardella became its leader. She was aiming for the presidency in the upcoming 2027\nelection, but after today her chances are looking increasingly slim. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old president of the Marine Le Pen's National Rally party (RN), has described  her the ban on her running as a presidential candidate in 2027 as a \"democratic scandal\". Writing on X, Bardella also calls for a \"popular, peaceful mobilisation\", posting a link to an online petition which read: \"It is not just Marine Le Pen who is being unjustly sentenced: it is French democracy that is being executed. It is no longer a government of judges, but a dictatorship of judges, which wishes to prevent French people from expressing themselves.\"  \"Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!\" France's High Council of the Judiciary, a constitutional body formed to ensure judicial independence, has released a statement expressing concern at the reactions to today's verdict. Members expressed concern about \"the virulent reactions\" to the ruling, saying they are likely to seriously call into question the independence of the judiciary. Legal proceedings must take place in a \"calm atmosphere\" and threats personally targeting the judge in charge of the case cannot be accepted in a democratic society, the statement continues. It concludes by calling for moderation in the comments made about today's proceedings. John RigbyBBC Newshour Former RN MEP Bruno Gollnisch pictured in court in September A leading member of National Rally tells the BBC that todayâs verdict is âabsolutely incredibleâ and âagainst all principles of lawâ. Bruno Gollnisch is a former Member of the European Parliament for the party and a current member of the national council of Le Pen's National Rally. He's also one of more than 20 members or former members of RN convicted today for misusing EU funds for party affairs. âI think itâs absolutely incredible. I think this judgement is against all principles of law and the separation of power at the basis of our constitutions,\" he tells BBC Newshour. Gollnisch describes the conviction as \"an\ninfringement on democracy\" and warns that there would be \"increasing\nanger in the people\".  He adds that the party \"would survive\nanyway\" but that \"it will ask for revenge\", and that the use of money was âperfectly natural and the common practice in the European Parliament\". Billionaire Elon Musk has weighed in on Le Pen's sentencing on social media, calling it a political abuse of the legal system. \"This will backfire, like the legal attacks against President Trump,\" he says in another post, referencing the US president's conviction for falsifying business records relating to a payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels.  Musk had publicly campaigned for Le Pen and the RN party on his social media platform X. Similarly, former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro has also described the ruling as \"left-wing judicial activism\" in comments reported by the Reuters news agency. In 2023, Bolsonaro was barred from public office until 2030 for abuse of power ahead of the 2022 elections, when he summoned ambassadors to attack the legitimacy of Brazil's voting system. Hugh SchofieldParis Correspondent Maybe Marine Le Pen was naive in not predicting this outcome.  It certainly appears as if her National Rally party was singularly unprepared for it. So as they meet in emergency session after the verdict, party leaders are in a dilemma. Do they continue as if there is a still a chance Le Pen will run in 2027? In theory there is still a small possibility.   She has already launched an appeal. The appeal could be accelerated and take place at the end of this year or early 2026. A verdict would follow in the spring. A different decision at the appeal hearing could lessen the period of ineligibility, or remove it altogether â in which case she could still run.   But the chances must be regarded as slim. Or, should they proceed with plan B â that is to say, with naming party president Jordan Bardella as de facto the man who will run in Le Penâs place? That might be a more realistic assessment of what lies ahead.   But to turn to Bardella too quickly would be unseemly. And anyway, not everyone in the party is a fan. Jordan Bardella, the president of the National Rally party, is calling for a \"peaceful\" mobilisation after the Le Pen verdict. In a statement, he describes the sentence as a \"democratic scandal\" and says \"French democracy is being executed\". \"By banning Marine Le Pen from running in the 2027 presidential election, they are attempting to prevent her accession to the ÃlysÃ©e Palace by any means necessary,\" he says. \"Through our popular and peaceful mobilisation, let us show them that the will of the people is stronger,\" he says, prompting his followers on X to sign a petition of support. \"Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!\" Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Thames Water picks US private equity firm KKR as preferred buyer",
        "content": "Thames Water has picked US private equity giant KKR as its \"preferred partner\" to buy the troubled water utility firm. The planned investment by KKR would help it deal with its mountain of debt, and Thames is aiming for the transaction to be completed in the second half of this year. Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, started to look for new investment last year after fears emerged that it could collapse or face nationalisation. The firm has been heavily criticised for sewage spills, and is also struggling to fix leaks and modernise outdated infrastructure. Thames Water serves about a quarter of the UK's population, mostly across London and parts of southern England, and employs 8,000 people. The government has previously said it is ready to take over Thames Water in the event that it cannot continue to operate, but earlier this year the company secured a Â£3bn rescue loan to avert this possibility. Regardless of who owns the company, its water services will continue as normal. Thames said recently that it had received approaches from six firms about taking a stake in the business. It will now enter the next stage of the investment process with KKR, one of the world's largest private equity firms with $160bn of investments globally. KKR is already a shareholder in another UK water provider, Northumbrian Water. Thames did not say how much KKR planned to invest, but said the proposal would lead to a \"material impairment\" for some creditors, meaning a write-off of some of the debt and interest Thames Water owes. Thames added there was no certainty that a binding proposal would emerge, and it would require regulatory approval. \"The company remains focused on putting Thames Water on a more stable financial foundation, implementing its turnaround plan and delivering a market-led solution that is in the best interests of customers, UK taxpayers and the wider economy,\" it said. When Thames was privatised in 1989, it had no debt. But over the years it borrowed heavily and now has debts of about Â£19bn. Its debt pile increased sharply when it was owned by Macquarie, an Australian infrastructure bank. Macquarie has said that it invested billions of pounds in upgrading Thames's water and sewerage infrastructure while it owned the company. But critics argue that it took billions of pounds out of the company in loans and dividends. Along with many UK water firms, Thames Water has been in the spotlight for pumping sewage into rivers. Between 2020 and the end of last year, it discharged at least 72 billion litres of sewage into the Thames. Thames Water's Â£3bn rescue deal cleared by court Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?

        "title": "Marine Le Pen found guilty in EU funding embezzlement case",
        "content": "Marine Le Pen has criticised a court ruling that bans her from running for public office as a \"political decision\" and says she will appeal.  The French far-right politician was found guilty on Monday of embezzling EU funds and she was barred from standing in an election for five years, with immediate effect. The decision means that, unless she can get her sentence overturned before the 2027 presidential election, Le Pen will likely not be able to stand.  \"I'm not going to let myself be eliminated like this,\" Le Pen told French TV station TF1. She said she would appeal against the verdict \"as soon as possible\" using \"whatever legal avenues I can\". Shock verdict rocks French far right Le Pen has been given a four-year prison sentence, of which two will be suspended. The other two can be spent with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She has also been handed a â¬100,000 (Â£82,635) fine. \"Millions of French people are outraged,\" she said, claiming that judges have \"implemented measures that are reserved for authoritarian regimes\". Le Pen added that she was \"scandalised, indignant, but this indignation, this feeling of injustice, is an additional push to the fight that I fight for them [the voters]\". But the appeal process may take a long time.  The appeals trial would probably not happen for another year, and a verdict would come several months after that. Preparing a presidential campaign under these circumstances could prove complicated.   The 2027 election would have been her fourth attempt, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old president of the National Rally (RN), said on Monday that Le Pen's sentencing was a \"democratic scandal\".  Bardella also called for a \"popular, peaceful mobilisation\".  He then posted a link to an online petition which says a \"dictatorship of judges... wished to prevent French people from expressing themselves\". \"Let's show those who want to circumvent democracy that the will of the people is stronger!\" the petition reads. At the start of the reading of the verdict, the judge, BÃ©nÃ©dicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" which saw the embezzlement of â¬2.9m worth of European funds. Two dozen RN figures were also found guilty and the party was ordered to pay a â¬2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Le Pen was accused, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, of hiring assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them. During the trial last year, Le Pen denied she had committed \"the slightest irregularity\".  Before the sentence was issued on Monday, she stormed out of the court, alongside other defendants and headed to the RN's Paris headquarters, where the party held a \"crisis meeting\".  At the weekend, Le Pen had told media that while she was \"not nervous\", the judges had \"the power of life or death over the [political] movement\". Shortly before her sentencing, Le Pen received messages of support from the Kremlin, as well as European allies such as Hungary's Viktor Orban and Italy's Matteo Salvini.  But some of Le Pen's opponents have also stated they disapprove of the judge's decision.  Media reported that centrist Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Bayrou was \"troubled\" by the ruling against Marine Le Pen, although he did not intend to make a public statement on the matter. \"The choice to dismiss an elected official should only belong to the people,\" said Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon of the far-left France Unbowed (LFI). And Laurent Wauquiez, of the right-wing Republicans, said that the decision would \"weigh very heavily on the functioning of our democracy\".  \"It's undoubtedly not the route that should have been taken.\" The reading of the verdict, which started shortly after 10:00 (09:00 BST), took nearly three hours. Prosecutors probe Marine Le Pen campaign funding The far right came close to power in France. What about the rest of Europe?

        "title": "New NHS doctors only being told job location with weeks to spare",
        "content": "Jayne Evans is one of hundreds of \"placeholder\" resident doctors who do not know where they will be based Jayne Evans has completed four years at medical school in London - but says she is still being left in the dark about where her first permanent NHS position will be. \"I was told that I don't have a job set aside for me,\" she said. \"They've guaranteed we will only be offered jobs other people decline and there's just no sort of timeline that they can give us.\" Ms Evans has been given a rough idea of where she will be working - the Trent area, which spans almost all of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire - but no further clues. \"They've even admitted it could be three weeks before I start work that I find out what city I'm living in,\" she told the BBC. Ms Evans says working as an epidemiologist during the Covid pandemic inspired her to become a doctor She is one of hundreds of newly qualified medical students who have not been found a specific job by the NHS yet. Instead they have a so-called \"placeholder job\", meaning they have only been told the rough part of the country they will be in. Without knowing where they will be living, they say they are not able to start preparations for moving. It is the second year a new system has been used to allocate foundation jobs for doctors. Previously, students were ranked and jobs were allocated based on merit, but this was changed for fear it was stressful for students and particularly unfair on those from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minorities.  They tended to perform less well, and therefore were more likely to be posted to regions they did not favour, according to the UK Foundation Programme. Instead, jobs are assigned randomly, which means a higher proportion of students are not getting what they asked for. There has also been an increase in the number of medical students applying for jobs after the government opened several new medical schools. Ms Evans said it had overshadowed her achievement in qualifying. \"I was expecting around this time to feel excited or even nervous, but now mostly I just feel angry and disrespected,\" she said. \"I went into medicine and was told we needed doctors and the NHS needs help but I've been told there is no job for me. \"No-one's offered me any sort of clarity or even an apology.\" Dr Hassan Nassar was one of more than 1,000 medical students in the same position last year. The British Medical Association (BMA) estimates that number has dropped to about 700 this year. \"My graduation was one of uncertainty, not excitement,\" recalled the 24-year-old. \"I was assigned to the East Midlands - somewhere in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland - but didn't know which hospital I'd be in for months, so couldn't plan my life or find a place to live. \"I spent the first four weeks of my job as a doctor in temporary accommodation.\" He said he was lucky he ended up allocated to Leicester, even if it was last minute. \"I had no links to the East Midlands and was so nervous about coming,\" he said. \"But Leicester has welcomed me with open arms. It is such a friendly and brilliant city, I'm lucky that I've been able to make friends and make it work.\" Dr Hassan Nassar says not knowing where he was working until the last minute meant he could not plan his life The BMA, the union that represents doctors and medical students in the UK, has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors - formerly known as junior doctors - after increasing the number of medical school places. \"The government has increased the number of medical school places - but not the number of foundation jobs,\" Callum Williams, the union's deputy chair of education, said. \"The government needs to increase that funding - and these jobs should go to UK-trained doctors first.\" Mr Williams said there was a danger students would move abroad. \"It's your first job with the NHS, it is supposed to be exciting and instead it leaves a sour taste in your mouth,\" he said. \"It's essential that we keep doctors in the NHS - and when this is students' first experience with NHS employment, it increases the risk that they'll join so many of their colleagues in moving abroad.\" The BMA worries resident doctors will leave to work abroad if they have poor experiences with the NHS Research carried out by the BMA found almost a third of current medical students say they intend on working abroad, and close to half of those say they do not plan to return. Ms Evans was born in the US but has lived in the UK since she was 12. She said: \"People hear my accent and say, 'are you American? Are you going back to America?' \"I've been really confident the whole time I've been studying saying I don't want to go back to America. I love it here. \"I want to work for the NHS, I really am passionate about healthcare that is free at the point of access. That really matters to me.\" Now she isn't so sure. She said: \"When I told my family this was happening, I was in the US and they sat down with me and said 'what are you doing? Just come back, because you won't be treated like that here'.\" The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment and referred the BBC to NHS England. An NHS England spokesperson said: \"While record numbers of applicants have received their first choice this year, we appreciate the uncertainty and anxiety that many applicants who have been allocated placeholder posts experience while we finalise their training programme. \"We have reassured those affected that they will receive a place on a training programme with support available from their foundation schools during the wait - we will continue to work closely with foundation schools to get applicants more information about their programmes as soon as possible.\" Are you a new doctor who doesn't know what your job will be?

        "title": "UK to relax electric car sale rules as Donald Trump's tariffs hit",
        "content": "The government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US. A ban selling new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, but manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast its changes were not a \"silver bullet\" but part of the solution to responding to US tariffs. UK opposition parties said Labour's measures would not be enough to boost the car industry. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, which is a major export market for the UK motor industry.  It came into force last week and is separate to a 10% tax on nearly all UK products announced by Trump on Wednesday.    A consultation on the government's EV target changes ended in mid-February, but Alexander told the BBC that the government had sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs.  The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously \"strengthen its commitment to the phase out\" while introducing \"practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition\". Currently, 28% of new cars sold in the UK this year must be electric, a target that will rise each year until 2030. But manufacturers will now be given more freedom in how they meet their yearly targets - meaning if they don't sell enough EVs in one year, they can make up for it by selling more the next year, for example. In addition, the fine of Â£15,000 per vehicle sold that does not meet the latest emissions standards will be cut to Â£12,000. Meanwhile, a ban on the sale of hybrid vehicles - which combines a petrol or diesel-powered engine with an electric motor - has been confirmed as from 2035. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline As part of the changes, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Times on Monday that the government is \"putting Â£2.3bn towards tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure\".  The Treasury later told the BBC this means the government will invest Â£2.3bn in the car industry - all of which was announced in last October's Budget. Live updates as Trump's tariff turmoil deepens Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be? 'Sometimes you have to take medicine': Trump defends plan The ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars was extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government, but Labour promised to restore the 2030 deadline in its manifesto for the 2024 election. Car industry leaders have previously warned that drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and a lack of charging point infrastructure. Sir Keir said the measures would \"boost growth that puts money in working people's pockets\" and ensure \"home-grown firms\" can export UK-made cars worldwide. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the changes are \"very much needed\". However, Robert Forrester, chief executive of car dealership chain Vertu Motors, told the BBC said there were \"lots and lots of words in the announcement but it doesn't really address the major issues\". He said manufacturers will still be paying billions in fines, despite the cut to Â£12,000 per car. \"Nothing has really changed here - this is just tinkering,\" he said, adding: \"The government has gone for hope over reality.\" Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith described the measures as \"half baked\" and repeated Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's claim that \"net zero by 2050 is impossible\". Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson called for \"better incentives\" for consumers to buy electric vehicles, and said the changes \"won't be enough to protect the sector from the impact of Trump's damaging tariffs\". The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union. Coventry-based car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover announced on Saturday that it will \"pause\" all shipments in April to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\". A separate 10% tariff on UK imports came into effect on Saturday, with higher rates in place for some other major economies.

        "content": "Critics says Zimbabwe's president is trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced he will suspend tariffs on goods imported from the US in an attempt to build a \"positive relationship\" with President Donald Trump's administration. The move comes days after Trump imposed 18% tariffs on Zimbabwean exports to the US. \"This measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States,\" Mnangagwa said on X.  Zimbabwe has had strained diplomatic relations with the US since it adopted a controversial land policy about 25 years ago, and because of its poor human rights record.  Trade between the two countries amounted to only $111.6m (Â£86.6m) in 2024, US government data shows, external.  Follow live: Global leaders try to soften tariffs impact   The US exported goods worth $43.8m to Zimbabwe in 2024, up 10.6% from the previous year, while imports were down 41% to  $67.8m. Zimbabwean political analyst Tendai Mbanje told AFP news agency that the decision would not result in substantial economic benefits for Zimbabwe and would would only benefit the US.  Prominent Zimbabwean journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin'ono said  the president appeared to be trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration.  Mnangawa possibly hoped that the administration would lift sanctions imposed on him, but it was a \"long shot\", he added on X.     Trump's tariffs could be death knell for  US-Africa trade pact How jeans and diamonds pushed Lesotho to the top of Trump's tariffs list Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy The US first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's government during the rule of Robert Mugabe after he introduced a land reform programme in 2000 that led to the seizure of white-owned farms, and because of repressive measures taken against the opposition. The Biden administration in the US scrapped the sanctions in 2024, replacing them with targeted sanctions on 11 individuals - including Mnangagwa - for \"democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption\".  Mnangagwa has previously denied the allegations, describing the sanctions as \"illegal and unjustified\".  Announcing his decision to waive tariffs on US imports, he said Zimbabwe's focus was on \"fostering amicable relations with all nations, and cultivating adversarial relationships with none\". \"This action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation,\" he added.  Chin'ono said that Mnangagwa was currently the chairman of the regional bloc Sadc, and should be trying to forge a common response to the US rather than acting unilaterally.  \"When countries face global economic shifts, co-ordinated responses offer better leverage and stability,\" he added.  Lesotho - another southern African state - was hit with 50% tariffs, the highest in the list released by Trump on Wednesday.

        "title": "US cancels visas for South Sudanese over deportation dispute",
        "content": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the US is immediately revoking visas issued to all South Sudanese passport holders due to the African nation refusing to accept its citizens who have been removed from the US.  Rubio, in a statement on Saturday, added that the US would also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry. He blamed \"the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner\". A cornerstone of President Donald Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants from the US, with the promise of \"mass deportations\". \"It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States,\" said Rubio.  \"Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them,\" he added. It comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war. On 8 March, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as regional fighting broke out, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018. South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to remain in the US for a set period of time.  TPS for South Sudanese in the US had been due to expire by 3 May. South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. But just two years later, following a rift between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar, the tensions erupted into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army. Sporadic violence between ethnic and local groups has continued in parts of the country. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has clashed with international governments over deportations of their nationals from the US.   In January, Colombian President Gustavo Petro barred two US military flights carrying deported migrants from landing in his South American country.  Petro relented after Trump promised to place crippling tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. One of the most famous South Sudanese citizens currently in the US is Duke University star basketball player 18-year-old Khaman Maluach. A spokesman for the university said on Sunday the school was \"aware of the announcement... regarding visa holders from South Sudan\". \"We are looking into the situation and working expeditiously to understand any implications for Duke students.\" Maluach, who played for the South Sudanese Olympic basketball team last summer, spent much of his life in Uganda after fleeing his violence in his homeland as a child. The first-year student - whose Duke team was eliminated from the national championship tournament Saturday night after losing in the semi-finals to the University of Houston - is widely expected to join the ranks of the NBA after graduation.

        "content": "Esme Baker, 10, and her 48-year-old father Lee Baker are believed to have died in the fire Two people who died following a fire at a caravan park have been named by police. Lee Baker, 48, and his 10-year-old daughter Esme Baker, died at Golden Beach Holiday Park, in Ingoldmells, Skegness on Saturday. They were from the Nottingham area and had been \"excited to be spending the first weekend of the holidays together\", their family said in a tribute. \"We are all utterly devastated at what's happened. This loss is incomprehensible at the moment,\" they added. Drone footage of the park showed the remains of the caravan after the fire on Saturday Lincolnshire Police said it was still awaiting formal identification, which could take some time.   The police and fire service were called to the holiday park at about 03:50 BST on Saturday and said they were working together on the investigation to establish the cause of the blaze.  Senior investigating officer Det Insp Lee Nixon said the intensity of the fire had made the investigation \"incredibly challenging\". \"We are working hard to validate the facts available to us to be able to provide answers for the family and loved ones of those who were very tragically taken by this fire,\" he said.  Dan Moss, area manager for prevention and protection at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said: \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the family at this time.  \"Once investigations are complete, local fire crews and our community fire safety team will be on hand to talk to people in the area and address any fire safety concerns they may have, at what will be an upsetting time.\" Tributes were left at the Golden Beach Holiday Park on Sunday morning In a statement, the owners of the park said: \"On behalf of everyone at Golden Beach Holiday Park we would like to send our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends affected by [Saturday's] tragic events.\" They thanked emergency services for their help and support and asked for \"patience and privacy\" while investigations continued. People laid tributes at the park on Sunday morning. Jack Price, who works as a bingo caller at the Sandancer pub in Ingoldmells, said he knew Mr Baker and Esme well.  \"It's like they were family members, they weren't just customers to us. Everyone behind the bar knew them. It's just unbelievable,\" he said. An online fundraiser set up by the pub for the victims' family described them as \"two peas in a pod\" who were \"both happy-go-lucky people who loved life\". Ruth Dorrin, who donated to the appeal, said: \"It's just so sad and when you've got little ones, it's just heartbreaking. \"You're meant to come on holiday to enjoy yourself, aren't you? It's justâ¦ you can't put into words.\" Another fundraising page set up to support the family said: \"Lee was a hard working plasterer who loved his football and adored his darling daughter. \"Esme was the brightest, funniest, most intelligent, happy little girl who loved to read, colour, dance her little heart out.\"  Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

        "content": "A car struck the bridge over the line on Donbank Terrace Train services around Aberdeen have been disrupted after a car crashed into a stone wall above railway tracks. Network Rail said the line between Aberdeen and Dyce had to be closed at about 21:00 on Saturday, while police sealed off the area at Donbank Terrace. Specialist engineers have assessed the damage and repairs need to be carried out to the bridge parapet. Debris also needs to be removed from the area. The line will remain closed on Sunday as it is unsafe to run trains under the bridge, with Network Rail describing the damage as \"significant\". Alterations have been made to the ScotRail timetable and passengers have been urged to check their journeys before travelling. Network Rail said the damage was significant Police Scotland said the driver had left the scene of the crash before officers arrived at about 19:40. A spokesperson for the force said inquiries were ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

        "title": "DIY: Are Britons losing their ability to do it themselves?",
        "content": "Handyman Simon King says people are losing the ability to carry out even the most basic of tasks Are Britons losing their ability to mend, preferring instead to call in a professional at the first sight of a blown fuse? BBC News takes a dive into the issue. Handyman Simon King makes an interesting point, as he holds his well-thumbed copy of Collins Complete DIY Manual, acquired when he bought his first house 30 years ago: \"You don't see comedies on the TV poking fun at DIY mishaps these days, do you?\" If sitcoms loosely mirror life, it is perhaps no wonder that the likes of hapless DIYer Frank Spencer, played by Michael Crawford, no longer draw in prime time audiences. After all, there is not much comedy gold in a professional fixing a kitchen tap without causing a biblical flood, or putting up a shelf - and it staying attached to the wall. \"People just aren't doing as much DIY,\" reports Mr King, offering a view from the coalface. Michael Crawford's character Frank Spencer entertained viewers with his tales of DIY woe Matt Walton, senior analyst at Globaldata, a company that provides insights on various industries, including retail, agrees. He believes the boom period of DIY, seen during the Covid pandemic, has \"been and gone\". \"When people were furloughed they had time on their hands to do jobs around the house,\" he says. \"But we've moved on.\" Mr Walton cites difficulties in getting on the housing ladder as another reason for the DIY malaise. He says: \"We have a lot of people in Britain in rental accommodation. In many cases, they are not permitted to carry out work on properties themselves. \"I also think these skills are just not being passed down to younger generations, as they once were.\" Fewer people are attempting DIY jobs around the house, it is claimed Mr King, 55, who operates out of Lincoln, thinks Britain has lost its \"make do and mend\" culture.  \"My dad was from that era... and I think most people from his generation would at least have had a go at stuff, which is where a lot of the comedy stuff came from when it went wrong.\"  Mr King recalls taking TVs apart \"just to see how they worked\", before screwing them back together.  \"These days, though, they're not designed to be taken apart and there's not really much you can do to repair them without the right diagnostic equipment.\" Many of his customers are homeowners without the skills, confidence, time, or frankly, the inclination, to attempt even the most basic of DIY tasks, he reports. \"Lots of people call me just to put a picture up on the wall. My son said to me once, 'Dad, I can't believe people actually pay you just to do that'.\"  Mr King still refers to his trusty manual. \"I got it when I bought my first house,\" he says. \"I didn't have the money to spend on hiring someone to do the work so I had to learn to do it myself.\" He believes people changing lifestyles has led to a general malaise for DIY home improvements.  \"If you're working that hard, you don't want to spend your weekend doing DIY jobs,\" says Mr King. \"So people will ring up a local handyman instead.\" But while Mr King is happy with the status quo - it is keeping him in work - in East Yorkshire, Alan Dalgairns and his Hull Repair Cafe are working on a fix. Here, people can bring in items, which would ordinarily be thrown out, to be fixed - for free - by experienced DIYers. A charge is only applied for parts needed to carry out repairs. Alan Dalgairns fears younger Britons are not learning basic DIY skills    \"People will sit with our repairers while the work is carried out, in the hope that next time they might feel confident to have a go themselves,\" says Mr Dalgairns, 51.  He also thinks skills are not being passed down family lines. Alongside the cafe, Mr Dalgairns runs Hull Library of Stuff, which loans - for a nominal fee - items ranging from extension ladders to angle grinders and chisel sets. \"A lot of younger ones who come in to borrow equipment don't have a clue how it works,\" he says. \"I'll then spend time showing them how to use the item properly and safely.\" \"I think we are losing those basic skills, and I think it's because younger generations are not seeing their parents carrying out these type of jobs.  \"I am a dad to a 10-year-old who watches me repair stuff but we're probably in a minority. \"I'm very much of the mindset what if something is broken, what is the worst that can happen?\" He recalls watching his parents \"mend and make things\". \"I remember coming home from school one day and finding a new chair. My mum had made it from an old bed. My dad would do all the repairs around the house.\" Mr Dalgairns believes many young people today \"don't have a clue what's inside products\". He says: \"They think stuff works using black magic. But what they don't seem to get is that a lot of time something stops working because of something really simple. That's especially true when it comes to sound systems, for example.\" Mr Dalgairns says some young people are turning to social platforms like YouTube for instructional videos \"usually recorded by older people who know what they're doing\". But he believes nothing beats learning practical skills, hands on, from someone experienced. \"That's why we have set up a kids' club, encouraging children to get under the hood and take things apart,\" he says. Mr Dalgairns explains the organisation has teamed up with Dove House, a local hospice, which runs a re-use shop at a council-run household recycling centre. He says they get electrical items that no longer work and encourage children to take them apart and \"examine the various components\". The club is on a hiatus at the moment, says Mr Dalgairns. \"We're confident it'll return next year.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

        "content": "The statue was first erected at Euston station in 1871 A Grade II listed statue of railway pioneer Robert Stephenson is to go on show at a museum.  The bronze 8ft 10in (2.7m) statue of the Northumberland-born engineer will be unveiled at the Locomotion museum in Shildon, County Durham, on Tuesday. It was first erected at Euston station in London in 1871 and was on display until 2020 when it was moved into storage due to HS2 works.  Museum head Sarah Price said she hoped the statue would help \"inspire\" the next generation of engineers from the north-east of England. Robert Stephenson and his father George set up the first company in the world to build commercial steam trains. The firm produced Locomotion No 1 in 1825, the first engine to pull a passenger train on a public railway. Stephenson also developed the London and Birmingham railway which opened in 1838 - the first intercity railway into the capital. The statue has been leased to the museum on a 10-year-deal The statue of Stephenson was designed by Italian sculptor Carlo Marochetti in the 19th Century.  It was on display at Euston for 149 years until it was put into storage. Ms Price said the statue had been leased to the museum for 10 years and had been restored ahead of its unveiling to the public again.  \"It will look pretty much brand new,\" she said.  With all the trains on display at the Locomotion museum, Ms Price said it was \"easy to forget\" the \"human endeavour\" behind the feats of engineering.  \"Having a statue of somebody who was so intimately involved in that kind of early story - it's just easier for people to relate to,\" she said.

        "title": "Mental health: Large rise in NI universities' spending since Covid-19",
        "content": "The amount of money Northern Ireland universities are spending on mental health and wellbeing services for students has increased significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic. Figures received via Freedom of Information requests have revealed the amount of money allocated has increased by an average of more than 40% since 2020. That includes the annual amount for salaries, wellbeing services and counselling. Northern Ireland's mental health champion welcomed the increased spending but called for a joined-up approach with statutory services. Professor Siobhan O'Neill said starting university very often coincided with the age at which most common mental disorders first present themselves. She put an increase in the recorded rates of poor mental health in students down to \"increased financial and social pressure\" as well as a \"reduced stigma and a willingness to ask for help\". \"International students, and those from marginalised communities such as students from black and ethnic minority groups, disabled students and LGBT+ students are at higher risk,\" she added. New mental health champion to 'challenge Stormont' Will a mental health champion make a difference? Ms O'Neill said the increased spending on mental health services \"reflects a recognition of the importance of providing timely access to mental health support to students who are struggling, so that students can fully benefit from higher education, and reduce the risk of dropout\". However, the mental health champion said this support needed to be accompanied by improvements in statutory mental health services. \"For example, a project linking university and statutory services in the Belfast Trust has been very effective, but it needs to be available in other areas of Northern Ireland.\" St Mary's University College, Belfast has seen the biggest increase with an 85.5% rise in spending from Â£124,927 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£231,691 in 2023/24. It said it had also received double its additional funding from the Department for the Economy's Step-Up Project with Â£50,000 in 2023/24 rising to Â£100,000 in 2024/25. This funding, a university spokesperson added, had been used to support the wellbeing of students using one-to-one mentor support and counselling services. Student mental health risk linked to area of study NI students' mental health 'left in the shadows' Stranmillis University College saw a 62% rise over the five years from Â£55,043 in 2020 to Â£89,208 in 2024. It said it operated a free and confidential, permanently-staffed student counselling service and had a qualified occupational health nurse on site. \"College staff operate an 'open door' policy where students are encouraged to make contact and to discuss issues of concern to them,\" the university added. The amount of spending on mental health services at Queen's University Belfast saw a 52% jump from Â£931,615 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£1,417,539 in 2023/24. The university added that there was a wide range of embedded mental health events and initiatives across the academic year for students. Ulster University's spending on mental health services increased 32% from Â£1,916,528 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£2,535,553 in 2023/24. It said the university promoted positive mental health and wellbeing initiatives to all pupils via its student wellbeing team, and offered them access to an external counselling provider. Dara Doyle thinks young men can be reluctant to admit they are struggling with their mental health Dara Doyle, 21, a third year psychology student at Queen's University Belfast, said he first reached out for help in 2023. \"I wasn't able to cope with the pressure of the work that was on me,\" he said. \"I was working part time and quite long hours away from the university and I was having a lot of social isolation. I wasn't feeling myself and knew I needed to talk to someone to make a plan to get back to being myself.\" Dara said he accessed a drop-in service and was then offered six sessions of counselling as well as semi-regular check-ups with his wellbeing support officer. He felt there was still a reluctance among young men to speak about their mental health. \"They are trying to seem strong and hold everything together.

        "title": "Why men are so unhealthy - and what can be done",
        "content": "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health â and what can be done about it? Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms. \"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\" The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health â a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.  In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75, external with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents. Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously. He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\" He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\" He says there are biological reasons â the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services. Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally â many go years without seeing a health professional. \"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\" This video can not be played Dr Xand van Tulleken on why more men should go to the doctor's - subtitled version here Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy. \"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\" But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest â a larger gap than is seen for women â and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75. \"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\" NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer. \"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\" NHS health checks are offered to the over 40s every five years and include blood pressure checks Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates. But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work. He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men. Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs. \"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them â they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White. Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes. But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\" He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players. Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities. \"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\" Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes. The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects. Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations â something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 â that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government. But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.  \"Look at your waist size â if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people. \"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\" UK will have men's health strategy, government says Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Video, 00:02:51Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Are we ready for the new male contraceptives?

        "title": "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might",
        "content": "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out. The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades. And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy. Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.  Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax. On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.  There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations. Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely. The basic lesson the White House has taken from history is that high tariffs made America \"great\" the first time Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.  But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board. It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.  The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports. In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisersâ¦ The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\" This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance. The long-term aim is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit down to zero This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.  The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data. While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing. There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.  The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (Â£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech. Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations. There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\". That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world. For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\". In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy. Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down. President Trump's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US doesn't reflect the overall picture, says Faisal Islam Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia. Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south. The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent. Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House. So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this. But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics. The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere. The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices. Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich. The world's consumers have choices. It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem. Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers. Globalisation has failed, according to the current Trump administration Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff. These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US. The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario. In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist. This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US. Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs. For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

        "content": "Abtisam Mohamed (left) and Yuan Yang have now left the country Two Labour MPs say they are \"astounded\" to have been denied entry to Israel while on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank.  Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang said it was \"vital\" parliamentarians were able to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory first-hand. They were refused entry because they intended to \"spread hate speech\" against Israel, the nation's population and immigration authority said. Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised Israeli authorities, describing the move as \"unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning\". But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Israel had a right to \"control its borders\", adding it was \"significant\" there were Labour MPs other countries did not want to let in. Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, and Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, flew to Israel from London Luton Airport with two aides on Saturday afternoon. The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to \"document the security forces\". The Israeli embassy in London said in a statement on Saturday that the country \"will not allow the entry of individuals or entities that act against the state and its citizens\".  It said Mohamed and Yang had \"accused Israel of false claims\" and were \"actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers\".  It also said they had supported campaigns aimed at boycotting the country \"at a time when Israel is at war and under attack on seven fronts\".  The UK Foreign Office said the group was part of a parliamentary delegation. However, Israel's immigration authority said the delegation had not been acknowledged by an Israeli official. The Israeli embassy said the MPs \"were offered hotel accommodation, which they declined\" and the cost of their return flight to the UK was covered.  Israel's Interior Ministry said the MPs left the country early on Sunday.  Mohamed and Yang said their trip had been organised with UK charities that had \"over a decade of experience in taking parliamentary delegations\". \"We are two, out of scores of MPs, who have spoken out in Parliament in recent months on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of complying with international humanitarian law,\" the MPs said in a joint statement.  \"Parliamentarians should feel free to speak truthful in the House of Commons, without fear of being targeted.\" Lammy said the Foreign Office had been in touch with both MPs to offer support, adding: \"I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians.\"  The Council for Arab-British Understanding and Medical Aid for Palestinians - the latter of which is a registered UK charity - said in a joint statement that they had organised the trip. \"This visit was part of that long-standing programme,\" they said. \"When questioned, the group was clear, open and transparent about the aims and objectives of the visit, which included visiting a range of projects run by humanitarian and development organisations operating in the West Bank. \"The group had informed the UK consul general in Jerusalem of their visit and was planning to meet with them as part of the itinerary.\" This video can not be played Watch: \"Countries should be able to control their borders\" - Badenoch on MPs denied entry to Israel Both Yang and Mohamed - who were first elected in 2024 - have made several interventions on the Israel-Hamas conflict in Parliament. In February, Mohamed initiated a cross-party letter, signed by 61 MPs and lords, calling for a ban on goods from Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, citing an opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). She has also criticised Israel for withholding humanitarian aid from Gaza, telling the House of Commons in October that international law \"prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\", and has mentioned humanitarian organisations' claims of \"ethnic cleansing\" in Gaza. In January, Yang spoke in favour of bringing sanctions against Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, after they suggested building Israeli settlements in northern Gaza to encourage Palestinians to leave. She has also highlighted the dangerous conditions journalists and medical professionals face while in the Palestinian territory. When asked about Israel's decision, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that countries \"should be able to control their borders\".  \"What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour [who] other countries won't allow through,\" Badenoch said. \"I think that's very significant.\"  This video can not be played Watch: Israel decision to deny MPs entry an \"insult to Britain\" - Thornberry Her comments were rebuffed by Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who described Yang and Mohamed as \"highly respected parliamentarians\" and \"potential leaders\". \"Israel is badly advised to try and alienate them, to humiliate them and to treat them in this way,\" she told the programme.  \"I think that it's an insult to Britain and I think it's an insult to Parliament.\" Sir Ed Davey accused Badenoch of \"yet another complete shocker\". The Liberal Democrat leader said she \"has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel\". Lammy called Badenoch's comments \"disgraceful\", asking her: \"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?\" During the war in Gaza, there have been protests, violent incidents and raids by Israeli forces in the West Bank. Hundreds of deaths have been reported there. Israeli troops have been engaged in an extended operation in the occupied Palestinian territory, where two Palestinians were killed on Friday. The current war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 50,000 people have been killed. It said 1,309 people have died since a ceasefire ended on 18 March.

        "title": "Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: The Palestinian Red Crescent said this video was found on the phone of a paramedic who was killed Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on 23 March. The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah. Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The mobile video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn. The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. An IDF official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members. When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy \"advancing suspiciously\". When the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire, the official said, despite no evidence any of the emergency team was armed. Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.  The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform. The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road.  They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident. The Israeli military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested. Earlier this week, a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights on and denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group. The IDF promised a \"thorough examination\" of the incident, saying it would \"understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\". The Red Crescent and many other international organisations are calling for an independent investigation. Israel renewed its aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of a ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase stalled. More than 1,200 people have since been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 50,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

        "title": "'Hands Off': Anti-Trump protests gather in cities across the US",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Thousands rally across the US in anti-Trump protests Crowds of protesters gathered in cities across the US on Saturday to denounce President Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.  The \"Hands Off\" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities.  Protesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.  Coming days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin. A protester in London held a toilet scrub brush that bears Trump's likeness Protesters in Paris joined in, holding up signs in English.  In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings.  Law student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month. \"You can stand up today or you can be taken later,\" she said, adding: \"I'm not usually a protest girlie.\" In London, protesters held signs reading, \"WTAF America?\", \"Stop hurting people\" and \"He's an idiot\". They chanted \"hands off Canada\", \"hands off Greenland\" and \"hands off Ukraine\", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the \"billionaire takeover of our government\". \"When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,\" he shouted. The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points.  In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration's policies and Elon Musk's influence.  A protest was held in West Palm Beach, Florida, nearby to where Trump was golfing Some polls show approval ratings for President Trump to be slipping slightly. One Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week found that his approval rating had dropped to 43%, its lowest point since Trump began his second term in January. When he was inaugurated on 20 January, his approval rating was 47%. The same poll found that 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 30% approve of his strategy to address the cost of living in the US. Another recent poll, from Harvard Caps/Harris, found that 49% of registered voters approve of Trump's performance in office, down from 52% last month. The same poll, however, found that 54% of voters believe he is doing a better job than Joe Biden did as president. One protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because \"we're losing our democratic rights\". \"I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,\" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits.  Asked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: \"Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.\" Trump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday. In Washington, protesters lampooned Trump's move to tariff a penguin-inhabited Australian island Protesters also gathered in Houston, Texas. The White House released a statement defending Trump's positions, saying he would continue to protect programs such as Medicare and pointing to Democrats as the threat. \"President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.\" One of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time.  \"They can protest a vacant house all they want,\" Homan said, adding that their presence \"tied up\" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks. \"Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,\" Homan continued. \"So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights. It's not going to change the facts of the case.\" In St. Paul, Minnesota, protesters railed against Trump and flew an upside down American flag, a distress message that has become a symbol of protest.

        "content": "MP Dan Norris has been arrested on suspicion of rape, child sex offences, child abduction and misconduct in a public office.  The Labour Party says it \"immediately suspended\" the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham after being made aware of his arrest.  Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that a man in his 60s was arrested on Friday and released on conditional bail. BBC News has contacted Norris for comment. Norris, 65, was elected as the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham in 2024, defeating the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. He had previously been in Parliament from 1997 to 2010 representing the seat of Wansdyke.  The MP was a junior minister under Gordon Brown and was an assistant whip under Tony Blair. Norris has also served as the Mayor of the West of England since 2021 but is due to step down ahead of May's local elections. According to the West of England Combined Authority website, Norris previously worked as an NSPCC-trained child protection officer. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said: \"In December 2024, we received a referral from another police force relating to alleged non-recent child sex offences having been committed against a girl. \"Most of the offences are alleged to have occurred in the 2000s but we're also investigating an alleged offence of rape from the 2020s. \"An investigation, led by officers within Operation Bluestone, our dedicated rape and serious sexual assault investigation team, remains ongoing and at an early stage. \"The victim is being supported and given access to any specialist help or support she needs. \"A man, aged in his 60s, was arrested on Friday (April 4) on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl (under the Sexual Offences Act 1956), rape (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003), child abduction and misconduct in a public office.  \"He's been released on conditional bail for enquiries to continue.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said on Saturday: \"Dan Norris MP was immediately suspended by the Labour Party upon being informed of his arrest. \"We cannot comment further while the police investigation is ongoing.\" The suspension means Mr Norris, the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham, is also understood to have had the party whip suspended, meaning he is not able to sit as a Labour MP in the Commons.

        "title": "UK cosmetic surgery trends: body contouring and anti-wrinkles",
        "content": "Treatments to remove wrinkles and tone arms, thighs and stomachs are driving a rise in cosmetic surgery, the latest figures, external from UK private clinics suggest. There were 27,462 procedures performed in 2024 - a 5% rise on 2023 - of which more than nine in ten were on women. Boob jobs remained the most popular treatment, followed by breast reduction surgery in second place. But much of the rise was driven by increases in facial rejuvenation surgery, such as face and brow lifts and body contouring procedures like liposuction and tummy tucks, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). The association's president said surgery has become cheaper and easier to access, while some patients say there is less stigma around cosmetic procedures. The most popular cosmetic surgeries, with their change from 2023 to 2024, are: Boob job (up 6%) Breast reduction (up 1%) Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery (up 13%) Abdominoplasty, or tummy tucks (up 6%) Liposuction, or fat removal (up 8%) Rhinoplasty, or nose jobs (down 1%) Face/neck lift (up 8%) Fat transfer (up 5%) Breast implant removal (down 5%) Otoplasty, or ear correction (up 2%) There was also a 24% rise in thigh lifts, and a 13% increase in brachioplasty, or \"bingo wing\" removal. Non-surgical procedures like botox and fillers were also popular: nearly 10,000 were performed by BAAPS members in 2024. But \"designer vagina\" labiaplasty surgery, which changes the shape or size of the labia, appeared less popular, with the number carried out down by 7%. Nugent said that cosmetic surgery had become \"more accessible\", and while she acknowledged that treatments still were expensive, she said that they had become a bit more affordable. This has coincided with a \"shift in attitude\" towards cosmetic procedures over the past decade because of a movement in society \"towards wellness and looking after oneself\", she said. Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added. Some of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said. And the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face. \"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said. The BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications. People have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons. Kirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve. She said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said. \"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said.  \"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\" Kirsten White says there's less stigma about people getting cosmetic procedures Men underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset. Nose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023. Face and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated. Beauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol.  The pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens. Dr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures. \"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said. BAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age. He said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\" The BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox. The data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits.  Cosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\".  It advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure. \"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.

        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\" after tariffs were imposed earlier this week. A 25% levy on car imports came into force on Thursday, one of several measures announced by US President Donald Trump which have sent shockwaves through global supply chains. The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union. In a statement, a Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said the company was \"taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans\". The Coventry-based car manufacturer - which also has sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton - said the US is an \"important market for JLR's luxury brands\". More cars are exported to the US from the UK than any other goods. In a 12-month period up to the end of the third quarter of 2024, the trade was worth Â£8.3bn, according to the UK trade department, external. An initial wave of tariffs on cars came into effect from 3 April, with import taxes on auto parts due to follow next month. Starmer vows to protect UK businesses from tariff 'storm' Globalisation era has ended, says Treasury minister Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy Car maker Nissan is thinking about moving some of its production of US-bound vehicles from Japan to the US as early as this summer, financial newspaper Nikkei has reported. Earlier this week Nissan said it would keep two production shifts at its plant in Tennessee, after announcing plans to scale back operations there in January. Meanwhile, carmaker Stellantis has said it will temporarily shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, a Canadian city on the US border, next week due to the new tariffs. The United Auto Workers union - which represents those working in car manufacturing in the United States and southern Ontario, Canada - has applauded the introduction of tariffs, saying the move \"signals a return to policies that prioritise the workers who build this country, rather than the greed of ruthless corporations\" A separate 10% tariff will be imposed on all other UK imports, with higher rates in place for some other major economies. Global stock markets have incurred heavy losses in recent days as firms grapple with how to adapt to the new trading environment. The FTSE 100 - which measures the performance of the 100 leading firms listed on the London Stock Exchange - plummeted by 4.9% on Friday, its steepest fall since the start of the pandemic.  Exchanges in Germany and France also saw similar declines. Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will take a calm approach to the trade tariffs and has ruled out \"jumping into a trade war\". He warned \"the world as we knew it has gone\" but said he was prepared to use industrial policy to \"shelter British business from the storm\". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, external, Sir Keir said he will continue to seek a trade deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, but mooted state intervention to protect the national interest. Sir Keir is holding talks with other European leaders to discuss how to respond to the White House's trade moves. The prime minister spoke to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, the first of several discussions planned between Sir Keir and European leaders over the weekend. Downing Street said Sir Keir and Macron had agreed \"a trade war was in nobody's interest\" but \"nothing should be off the table\".

I can't see my boys playing rugby and soccer,\" the 78-year-old superstar told The Times, external. \"It has been a very stressful time because I'm used to soaking it all up. It's distressing,\" he added. In September, the singer wrote on Instagram that a \"severe\" infection had left him with \"only limited vision\" in one eye, adding that his recovery would \"take time\". Elton John left with 'limited vision' in one eye Elton John on red carpet after vision issues Elton John album on hold because he 'can't see' Sir Elton and his filmmaker husband David Furnish have two sons, Zachary and Elijah. The songwriter said he \"can't see the telly\", adding: \"I haven't been able to see anything since last July.\" He admitted he does get \"emotional\" about his sight loss. \"But you have to get used to it, because I'm lucky to have the life I have. I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see something out of here,\" he said, pointing at his left eye. \"So you say to yourself, just get on with it.\" Sir Elton John pictured during his headline set at Glastonbury in 2023 Sir Elton previously said he'd been unable to finish his new album due to his eyesight issues.

The pair worked with producer Andrew Watt and his long-term songwriting partner Bernie Taupin on the album. Sir Elton said that they \"didn't all agree\", adding that he became \"frustrated\" when they stood up to him. He said: \"If I want to make a great album aged 76 or 77 I've got to be told and they put up with my little foibles, which were really about anxiety, self-doubt and not feeling very well at the time.  \"I was tired so I thought, I'm going to abandon this. \"The problem was three other people were involved and I knew that if I walked away from it I would hate myself for the rest of my life.\" He added that it is not the first time he has had doubts about his music. \"You wouldn't be human if you didn't have fear and doubt.

        "title": "Video footage appears to contradict Israeli account of Gaza medic killings",
        "content": "This video can not be played  Mobile phone footage has emerged that appears to contradict Israel's account of why soldiers opened fire on a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck on March 23, killing 15 rescue workers.  The video, published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), shows the vehicles moving in darkness with headlights and emergency flashing lights switched on - before coming under fire. The PRCS said the video was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially denied the vehicles had their headlights or emergency signals on.  But in response to the new video, the IDF told the BBC: \"All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\". A surviving paramedic previously told the BBC that the ambulances were clearly marked and had their internal and external lights on.  The latest video, which the PRCS said had been shown to the UN Security Council, shows the marked vehicles drawing to a halt on the edge of the road, lights still flashing, and at least two emergency workers stepping out wearing reflective clothing. The windscreen of the vehicle being filmed from is cracked and shooting can then be heard lasting for several minutes as the person filming says prayers. He is understood to be one of the dead paramedics. The footage was found on his phone after his body was recovered from a shallow grave one week after the incident. The bodies of the eight paramedics, six Gaza Civil Defence workers and one UN employee were found buried in sand, along with their wrecked vehicles. It took international organisations days to negotiate safe access to the site. Israel claimed a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been killed in the incident, but it has not provided any evidence or further explained the threat to its troops. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar earlier this week echoed the army account, saying \"the IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance\". The IDF promised to investigate the circumstances after a surviving paramedic questioned its account.  In an interview with the BBC, paramedic Munther Abed said: \"During day and at night, it's the same thing. External and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it's an ambulance vehicle that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All lights were on until the vehicle came under direct fire.\" He also denied he or his team had any militant connections. \"All crews are civilian. We don't belong to any militant group. Our main duty is to offer ambulance services and save people's lives. No more, no less,\" he said. Speaking at the United Nations yesterday the President of the PRCS, Dr Younis Al-Khatib, referred to the video recording, saying: \"I heard the voice of one of those team members who was killed. His last words before being shotâ¦'forgive me mum, I just wanted to help people. I wanted to save lives'. It's heartbreaking\". He called for \"accountability\" and \"an \"independent and thorough investigation\" of what he called an \"atrocious crime\". One paramedic is still unaccounted for following the 23 March incident.

        "title": "'I miss out on gigs at Nottingham venues due to wheelchair'",
        "content": "Jason Bell has used a wheelchair for two and a half years and says it's hard to get into some music venues in Nottingham \"It's frustrating knowing there's gigs on that I know people are going to but I can't,\" says Jason Bell, who's been in a wheelchair for the last two and a half years. He says wheelchair users have to miss out on gigs in Nottingham, because some venues, including Rock City and The Bodega, are not accessible.  The 55-year-old, who lives in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, injured his spinal cord three years ago while lifting boxes when \"something just snapped in my back\". A spokesperson for DHP Family, which runs Rock City and The Bodega, said they were committed to making their venues as accessible as possible and added everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy live music. Jason says The Bodega in Nottingham could be hard to make accessible because of its small size \"It's taken me a while to go back and see live music,\" Jason said. \"I missed the Sex Pistols last year, there's a gig on nearly every night at The Bodega that friends are going to and I've got no way of getting in.\" Jason said after researching the issue, as far as he can see, Rock City is \"the largest [music] venue in the UK without full disabled access\". \"There's a few wheelchairs that can get in, light, manual ones, but anything a little bit bigger, or battery [powered] wheelchairs can't get in,\" he added. \"Even if you did go in, there's no disabled loos or anything like that.\" Jason says he's missing out on gigs at Rock City Jason said he first contacted Rock City six months ago raising concerns about a lack of accessibility in the building, and was told there could be a solution.  \"This has been going on years and years. They've promised things and it's never come up,\" he said. \"I just cannot get into Rock City. I've spoken to other people in the same position. \"Everywhere else, even down to Rough Trade, I can get into. I'm able to get into Rescue Rooms and the staff are brilliant. \"Rock City is the big one, it has the bigger bands.\" Jason says music is his \"biggest passion\" and is the main way he makes friends and socialises. \"It's pretty hard work in a wheelchair, and music makes me forget about anything,\" he said. \"I grew up going to shows. Seeing the curtain rise, or the band strike up is ingrained in my DNA.\" Jason says there are several key things that music venues need to be fully accessible.  \"Flat access that can be used on your own, ramps small enough to wheel yourself up, reliable lifts that will get you up and down every floor,\" he said. \"We also need a viewing area you can use where you don't have to look behind people and access to bars and toilets. \"There's a lot more planning than just buying a ticket. \"I just want equality and to be able to get into venues like everyone else.\" Jason recently saw The Hoosiers at Rescue Rooms in Nottingham The DHP Family spokesperson said plans had been drawn up to provide disabled lift access to Rock City. They added: \"As a company, we are working with Attitude is Everything to do all we can to improve access for all audiences, and always welcome insight and feedback from our customers on what we can do better.\" The spokesperson says wheelchair users can access the Main Hall using the stair climber purchased in 2020. At The Bodega, they say wheelchair users can access the ground floor bar and garden bar, where there is also a disabled toilet.

        "title": "Margot Robbie seen filming Wuthering Heights in Yorkshire Dales",
        "content": "Margot Robbie has taken the lead role in a new adaptation of Wuthering Heights Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment.  The latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff. Emily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors. The locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members. She was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton. Fashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set. Margot Robbie even signed some autographs at the hotel where she stayed  The hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously attacked a Top Gear producer in 2015.  A staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby.  The employee told the BBC: \"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\"  The film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth.  The letting company's owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village.  One local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century. He said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\" Another Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route. The film's base camp was located in rural Arkengarthdale  Crew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\".  The film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026.  There are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work. The director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about.  \"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\"  Haworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928.  This video can not be played Listen: Margot Robbie spotted filming in Yorkshire Dales It has the largest collection of BrontÃ« items in the world.  Director Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the BrontÃ« Parsonage Museum.\"  There have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel.  One of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Rebel Wilson said she was 'loving it' in Yorkshire Other high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton.  Meanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.  Tinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough. Wilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent.  In 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway.  The owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.

        "title": "Tariffs welcomed in Ohio's industrial Trump country",
        "content": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners. And at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\" This is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans. Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue. For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates. \"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\" Miller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods. Mary Miller looks out from behind the counter at her sweet shop in downtown Delta As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since. Miller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring. \"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said. \"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\" Follow live: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality These sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks. The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts. But on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism. One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal. The North Star Bluescope on the edge of Delta runs around the clock and has recently undergone expansion North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning. The workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday. It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend. Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes. \"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry. Although he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement. \"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said. Gene Burkholder regularly stops by the Barn Restaurant for breakfast - no matter what the stock market is doing A couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president. But Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\" \"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party. The Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie. And as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks. \"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s.  \"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said. Delta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\". And while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.

        "title": "Excel Parking ordered to pay £10,240 in five-minute parking rule row",
        "content": "Hannah Robinson was asked to pay Â£11,390 despite her paying for parking A car park operator that demanded Â£11,390 in parking charges from a driver has lost a court case and been ordered to pay thousands in costs. Excel Parking, which has been criticised for charging drivers Â£100 if they took more than five minutes to pay at a car park in Derby, has been doing the same in Darlington. Hannah Robinson, 21, was among those to be caught out and received hundreds of letters demanding money, as well as repeated phone calls. Excel Parking eventually took her to court for some of the parking charge notices (PCNs), but a judge has now dismissed the claim and told the firm to pay Â£10,240.10 in costs to charity.  \"Following the court hearing I feel relieved and a massive weight has lifted from my shoulders,\" said Miss Robinson. \"It has been extremely stressful and frustrating; I constantly worried what letters I was receiving or who was going to knock at the door after the threats.\" Miss Robinson had free legal representation at the hearing on 26 March but the judge made a pro bono costs order, meaning Excel Parking will have to pay thousands in costs to a charity called the Access to Justice Foundation. This was the amount her legal team from Keidan Harrison spent defending the case. \"I feel happy that they [Excel Parking] are getting a taste of what it felt like for me,\" said Miss Robinson. Excel Parking Services Ltd told the BBC it did not want to comment as it was appealing. Miss Robinson was asked to pay Â£11,390 for 67 parking charge notices Miss Robinson said the problems began for her in June 2021, when she started parking at the Feethams Leisure car park in Darlington, as she worked in a restaurant above it. She said she paid each time but it sometimes took longer than five minutes due to poor phone signal and problems with the payment app. \"I started getting a couple of fines, and I was young and had just started driving, so I would pay them because I was scared,\" said Miss Robinson, from Stockton-on-Tees. She continued using the car park, despite the problems, because it was the safest one to use as a young woman on her own at night. \"There was actually a lift from that car park up to my workplace,\" she said. \"I worked unsociable hours, I finished late, sometimes midnight or one in the morning, it was just the safest option for me to go down there.\" These are just some of the parking charge notices and letters that Miss Robinson received She decided to start appealing against the charges towards the end of 2022, but Excel still wanted her to pay. \"I'd been begging to speak to them, constant emails,\" she said. \"I've got threads and threads of nobody wanting to communicate with me, and I was asking for so much help to try and sort this out.\" She eventually received a letter, in February 2024, asking her to pay 67 unpaid charges. Each one was Â£100, plus a Â£70 debt collection fee, so the total was Â£11,390. She then broke down and told her family what had been happening. \"I couldn't believe it,\" said her nan, Adrienne Atkin. \"I couldn't believe the amount, and I couldn't believe a company could do that, so I was shocked.\" Mrs Atkin then started trying to help her granddaughter. \"It's almost been a full-time job trying to keep on top of everything, and it's very easy for people to give up,\" said Mrs Atkin. \"It had an effect on a young girl that shouldn't have happened, when she should be out working, having fun. \"At some point Hannah just stayed in her bedroom. When her phone rang she was on edge because she didn't know if it was going to be them.\" Miss Robinson said she struggled to pay within five minutes due to poor signal in the car park Miss Robinson eventually received a court claim asking her to pay two of the Â£100 PCNs, plus a Â£70 debt collection for each, and various other costs. Excel Parking later applied to amend this claim so they could pursue 11 different PCNs. But at the hearing, District Judge Janine Richards dismissed this application, and also dismissed the original claim. She found Excel's \"conduct in relation to this litigation was both unreasonable and out of the norm\", and therefore ordered the firm to pay the winning party's legal costs of Â£10,240.10. Miss Robinson said she was grateful to her solicitors, Luke Harrison and Anya Prasad. \"I am overwhelmed with the support I have received,\" said Miss Robinson. \"The hearing was very tense but I'm glad the judge saw through them. \"I am upset with the way they have treated me and I hope this stops them going after innocent people.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Derby Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.

        "title": "Swapped at birth: How a home DNA test finally revealed the truth",
        "content": "Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit. Now a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual. \"I did notice there was a lot of Irish heritage, which as far as I knew was wrong,\" she says. \"But I just pushed it aside and didn't think any more of it. I stopped paying for my subscription and that was that.\" Except it very much wasn't. It took another six years for Susan - not her real name - to realise everything she knew about her family history was wrong. She later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward. Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites. A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England. Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time. After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives â close or distant. Six years later she received a message out of the blue. The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling. \"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says. Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother. He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant. Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family. Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born. The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website. It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago. In the 1950s and 60s babies were often cared for by midwives in large nurseries in NHS hospitals. Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries. The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay. In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives. \"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan. \"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\" From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS. Susan grew up believing her mother and father were her biological parents and only realised the truth after taking a home DNA test This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades. She grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role. Other than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\". \"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\" If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\". \"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says. On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through. \"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says. \"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\" She remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\". As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult. She has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked. \"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes. She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons. But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy. \"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says. \"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\" Susan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother. \"I'd still like to know a bit more about her â what she was like and all that â but I never will, so there you go,\" she says. \"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\" Susan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this. She needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology. Last year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas. Susan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago. \"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks. \"But I know this will be with me for the rest of my life. I just wanted a conclusion.\" Swapped at birth: How two women discovered they werenât who they thought they were Canadians switched at birth get an apology 70 years on The switched-at-birth babies who refused to swap back Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Trump extends deadline to keep TikTok running in US",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark',\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\" The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance. Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday. The social media platform, which says it has more than 170 million users in the US, must close in the US under a law passed by Congress - unless a buyer is found. In a statement on Friday, ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but \"an agreement has not been executed\". \"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" a spokesperson said.  Former US President Joe Biden's administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Congress passed a bipartisan law last year that gave ByteDance six months to sell its controlling stake in TikTok or see the app blocked in the US. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. The new extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership, and keep the popular app running in the US.  \"The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday. Who might buy TikTok as ban deadline looms? Amazon joins bidders A TikTok deal was reportedly nearly finalised on Wednesday, but fell apart after Trump on the same day announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China. ByteDance representatives contacted the White House to inform them China would no longer approve the deal unless negotiations on the tariffs could take place, a source familiar with the deal told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The unnamed source said the plan had been for Trump to sign an order initiating a 120-day period for closing the deal, allowing time to finish paperwork and secure financing.  The agreement had won approval from existing investors, new investors, ByteDance, and the US government, but China backed out once Trump imposed the global import taxes, CBS reports. The Chinese embassy in Washington DC said in a statement that it \"opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy\". This video can not be played Watch: Can young Americans live without TikTok? China faces a 54% aggregate tariff on goods imported into the US, and has retaliated with 34% in counter tariffs. Reports suggest several potential buyers for TikTok have cropped up in recent days. Amazon has put in a last-minute offer to the White House to acquire the platform, according to the BBC's US partner CBS, though the firm has declined comment. Several other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary. Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, has said he has joined Mr McCourt's bid. Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. TrumpÂ hasÂ saidÂ hisÂ administrationÂ wasÂ inÂ touchÂ withÂ four separate groups interested in a potentialÂ TikTokÂ deal, though he has not named them.  Vice-President JD Vance is spearheading the administration's effort to find a buyer. The president has also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports. \"We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that the trade levies are \"the most powerful economic tool, and every important to our national security\".

        "title": "Falklands surprised to be on Trump's 'worst offenders' tariff list",
        "content": "Fish is the main good exported by the Falkland Islands The Falkland Islands was surprised to be hit by one of the most punishing tariff rates on US President Donald Trump's \"worst offenders\" list, a member of the Falklands parliament has told the BBC. The British overseas territory is facing a 42% tax on the goods it exports to the US under Trump's shake-up of international trade. Teslyn Barkman, who oversees trade in the parliament, said the taxes would impact the economy, which is heavily dependent on the sale of fish to the EU and the US. But Barkman said the Falklands government would not respond with retaliatory tariffs and wanted a \"warm\" relationship with the US. Only eight other countries or territories dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances were given higher rates on Trump's list of tariffs, which are due to come into effect on Wednesday. \"It was a surprise,\" Barkman told the BBC. \"The fact a global superpower such as the US was paying attention to us at all caught us off guard.\" With a population of about 3,600 people, the Falkland Islands is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean. The territory has a government and sets its own trade policy, while the UK takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs. In 2023, the Falklands government reported a national income of Â£280m, with fishing accounting for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP). \"We're a village running a country,\" said Barkman, who holds responsibility for trade and economic development in the Legislative Assembly. \"So the sum of our trade exports is massive in terms of GDP.\" In 2023, the Falklands exported $27.4m (Â£21.2m) of goods to the US, mostly non-fillet frozen fish, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), external. In contrast, the OEC said the US exported $329,000 (Â£255,000) of goods to the Falklands. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to urgently meet Falklands Governor Alison Blake to discuss the impact of the tariffs. Sir Ed said the UK must include the interests of the Falkland Islands in its trade negotiations with the US. \"Trump's trade war could be the biggest threat facing Falklanders since Argentina's invasion,\" Sir Ed said. \"The UK government has a responsibility to step up and defend British citizens everywhere â including in the Falklands. \"President Trump has arbitrarily decided to hit Falklanders with some of his highest tariffs in an outrageous act of aggression that cannot be allowed to stand.\" Teslyn Barkman is the trade representative in the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands Barkman said the Falklands was still trying to figure out why Trump decided to levy a 42% tariff on its goods. The US imposed a 10% tariff on UK products. As analysis by BBC Verify showed, the tariffs are based on a calculation that factors in the difference in goods traded between the US and other countries. \"We're certainly not looking at any anything retaliatory at all,\" Barkman said.  \"We need to understand how that figure was arrived at because certainly the Falkland Islands approach has been that we're here to support the UK and her Western allies. She added: \"We want a warm relationship with the US as well.\" She said tourism was also a big contributor to the territory's economy, with large numbers of Amercians coming to see the renowned penguins living on the Falklands. \"Maybe that's an opportunity for us to build a closer relationship,\" Barkman said. She said the Falklands was working with the UK government to understand how the US tariff could be reduced or removed. EU tariffs on fish from the Falklands are a similarly pressing issue, given that is where the vast majority of those exports go. \"We're very aware that the EU and the UK are approaching reset talks and there might be an opportunity there to support our economy as well and the removal of EU tariffs against Falkland Islands products,\" Barkman said. The BBC understands Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty spoke with a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly on Thursday and will be engaging with affected overseas territories over the coming weeks.

        "title": "Ronin the rat sets new landmine-sniffing record",
        "content": "Five-year-old Ronin has helped Cambodians reclaim land that was once avoided for fear of landmines A landmine-detecting rat in Cambodia has set a new world record to become the first rodent to uncover more than 100 mines and other deadly war remnants. Ronin, an African giant pouched rat, has uncovered 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance since 2021, charity Apopo, which trains the animals, said in a statement. Cambodia remains littered with millions of unexploded munitions following about 20 years of civil war that ended in 1998. The Guinness Book of World Records said that Ronin's \"crucial work\" is making a real difference to people who have had to live with the \"fear that one misstep while going about their day-to-day lives could be their last.\" Apopo, which is based in Tanzania, currently has 104 rodent recruits, or HeroRATS, as the non-profit likes to call them. The rats are trained to sniff out  chemicals that are found in landmines and other weapons abandoned on battlefields. Because of their small size, the rats are not heavy enough to detonate the mines. The rats can check an area the size of a tennis court in about 30 minutes, the charity says, whereas a human with a metal detector might take four days to clear the same land. They can also detect tuberculosis, an infectious disease that commonly affects the lungs, far quicker than it would be found in a lab, external using conventional microscopy, Apopo says. It takes about one year to train each rat to detect unexploded landmines Ronin's impressive work in Cambodia's northern Preah Vihear province has surpassed the previous record held Magawa, a rat who sniffed out 71 mines and was presented with a gold medal for his heroism in 2020. Since Apopo's work began 25 years ago, the organisation has cleared 169,713 landmines and other explosives worldwide - more than 52,000 have been in Cambodia. The charity also works in other countries affected by war, including Ukraine, South Sudan and Azerbaijan. There are still an estimated four to six million landmines and other exploded munitions buried in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor.

        "title": "Kryvyi Rih: Children among 14 dead in Russian attack on Zelensky's home city",
        "content": "The attack on Kryvyi Rih is one of the deadliest Russian strikes on Ukraine this year A Russian missile attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has killed at least 18 people and left dozens wounded, Ukrainian officials have said. Nine of the dead were children, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih. Local officials said a ballistic missile had hit a residential area.  Images showed at least one victim lying in a playground, while a video showed a large section of a 10-storey block of flats destroyed and victims lying on the road. Russia's defence ministry later claimed a \"high-precision missile strike\" had targeted a meeting of \"unit commanders and Western instructors\" in a restaurant, and that up to 85 were killed. It provided no evidence. Ukraine's military responded by saying that Russia was spreading false information to try to \"cover up its cynical crime\". It said Moscow had fired an Iskander-M ballistic missile with a cluster warhead to maximise casualties. The attack, early on Friday evening, was among the deadliest on Kryvyi Rih since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, and comes as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. Zelensky wrote on social media that at least five buildings had been damaged in Friday's strike: \"There is only one reason why this continues: Russia doesn't want a ceasefire, and we see it.\" The head of Kryvyi Rih's defence, Oleksandr Vilkul, said a residential area was hit. \"The missile exploded in the air... to injure more people,\" he said. \"Children were killed on or near a playground.\" Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located, said more than 40 people were treated for wounds, and the youngest was only three months old. Later on Friday, Vilkul reported more explosions, saying the city was under a \"mass\" drone attack that triggered fires in at least four locations. He said one elderly woman burned to death in a private house hit by a drone. Another five people were injured elsewhere. Military chiefs from both the UK and France met Zelensky in Kyiv earlier in the day to discuss plans for foreign peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire deal. But there has been little sign of a let-up in the violence. Kryvyi Rih also came under attack earlier this week when a building in the centre was struck, leaving four people dead.  On Thursday, Russian drone strikes on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv claimed another five lives, local officials said. US says Putin will make decision on ceasefire in 'weeks, not months' Rosenberg: Trump takes US-Russia relations on rollercoaster ride France and the UK have accused Russia of dragging its feet on the Ukraine peace deal. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy told reporters at a Nato summit in Brussels that the Russian leader \"could accept a ceasefire now, [but] he continues to bombard Ukraine, its civilian population\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Russians knew the American position, \"and we will know from their answers very soon whether they are serious about proceeding with real peace or whether it is a delay tactic\". Kryvyi Rih is about 40 miles (70km) from the front line in eastern Ukraine and with a population of 600,000 it is reputed to be the longest city in Europe.

        "title": "ChatGPT AI action dolls: Concerns around the Barbie-like viral social trend",
        "content": "Left: BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman. Right: Her AI-generated action figure When scrolling through social media, you may have recently seen friends and family appearing in miniature. It's part of a new trend where people use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to re-package themselves - literally - as pocket-sized dolls and action figures. It has taken off online, with brands and influencers dabbling in creating their mini-me. But some are urging people to steer clear of the seemingly innocent trend, saying fear of missing out shouldn't override concerns about AI's energy and data use. It may sound complicated, but the process is simple. People upload a picture of themselves to a tool like ChatGPT, along with written prompts that explain how they want the final picture to look.  These instructions are really important. They tell the AI tool everything it is meant to generate, from the items a person wants to appear with to the kind of packaging they should be in - which includes mimicking the box and font of popular toys like Barbie.

Many online will then personalise it further with their name, job and clothing choices. Though it does not always work, and many have also shared some of the amusing mistakes the tools made, where the action dolls look nothing like them. Like other generative AI tools, image generators are also prone to making things up, and may make assumptions about how someone should look. And it's not just regular people using it - the trend has been seized upon by a wealth of brands online including beauty company Mario Badescu and even Royal Mail. Allow X content?

You may want to read Xâs cookie policy, external and privacy policy, external before accepting. To view this content choose âaccept and continueâ. Trends come and go - but by their very nature can make people feel compelled to take part to avoid missing out. \"Generative AI makes it easier and quicker for people to create and jump on trends,\" says Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at eMarketer. She says the technology has made it quicker and easier to make online content, which may have the unexpected effect of quickening the pace at which other social media users get annoyed by it. But she believes AI-driven trends will become a more regular appearance on our feeds \"as the tech becomes a more regular part of our digital lives\". While its light-hearted nature may have drawn people to it, the trend has drawn criticism from some concerned about its environmental impact. Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London tells the BBC that ChatGPT is \"burning through energy\", and the data centres used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries. \"We have a joke in my house that every time we create one of these AI memes, it kills a tree,\" says Lance Ulanoff, US editor of TechRadar, in an article about the trend, external. \"That's hyperbole, of course, but it's safe to say that AI content generation is not without costs, and perhaps we should be thinking about it and using it differently.\" What is AI and how does it impact the environment? People have also highlighted concerns that copyrighted data may have been used to create the technology which generates images without paying for it. \"ChatGPT Barbie represents a triple threat to our privacy, our culture and our planet,\" says Ms Neff. \"While the personalisation might feel nice, these systems are putting brands and characters into a blender with no responsibility for the slop that emerges.\" And Jo Bromilow, director of social and influencer at PR and creative agency MSL UK, asks: \"Is a cute, funny result really worth it?\" \"If we're going to really use AI properly, we have to set guardrails around how we use it conscientiously,\" she says. By Zoe Kleinman, BBC technology editor I started by finding a suggested prompt online - a list of instructions to enter into the AI tool in order for it to generate the image. You have to upload your own selfie with your prompt and you also have to be very specific about what you want, including a list of which accessories you'd like included and what colour you want the box to be. I found it took some time to perfect a pocket-sized and plastic-packaged version of myself When it came to providing my job title, my first attempt was declined because I included BBC News and was told this violated content policy - I think because currently the BBC does not allow ChatGPT to use its output. Once you do get an image you're likely to want to tweak it further; my first attempt was too cartoon-like.  The following, more realistic version made me look considerably older than I am, then too child-like, and I gave up in the end trying to get it to use my actual eye-colour, which kept defaulting back to blue (mine are a blend of hazel and green). It took a couple of minutes to generate each version and overall the process was slower than I would have liked, potentially because of its popularity.  It did start to feel like a lot of work for a passing trend, and it isn't perfect - my doll  is expanding out far beneath the supposed packaging. But more importantly, somewhere in a data centre some hot computer servers were toiling away to make Action Figure Zoe. They almost certainly could have been put to work on worthier causes.

        "title": "Judge allows Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil's deportation",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Moment Mahmoud Khalil is arrested by US immigration officers in New York A US judge has ruled the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained last month over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. Mr Khalil, a permanent legal US resident, has not been charged with a crime. In a letter written from the facility, he has said his \"arrest was a direct consequence\" of speaking out for Palestinian rights. The government has cited a Cold War-era immigration law, declaring that his presence in the US was adverse to American foreign policy interests. The immigration court's ruling does not mean Mr Khalil would be immediately removed from the country. The judge gave his lawyers until 23 April to appeal against the order. The activist has been held at a Louisiana detention centre since 8 March, when  immigration officers told him he was being deported for taking part in protests against the war in Gaza. Who is Mahmoud Khalil, Palestinian student activist facing US deportation? The 30-year-old was a prominent voice at Columbia University's protests against the war in Gaza last year. The Trump administration has cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for American foreign policy. The judge said the Trump administration was allowed to move forward with its effort to deport Mr Khalil because the argument that he poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the US is \"facially reasonable\". Mr Khalil, who was otherwise silent, addressed the court after the ruling. \"I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness,\" Mr Khalil said in court.  \"Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,\" he said. \"This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family.\"  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) described the decision as \"pre-written\".  The rights group said the ruling came less than 48 hours after the US government \"handed over the 'evidence' they have on Mr. Khalil - which included nothing more than a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that made clear Mr Khalil had not committed a crime and was being targeted solely based on his speech\". The government, particularly Rubio, has said its efforts to deport Mr Khalil were also to \"protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States\" even if his activities were \"otherwise lawful\". Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem praised the judge's ruling on Friday. \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America,\" she wrote on social media. \"When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews,  that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. Good riddance.\" This video can not be played Watch: Khalil case âfar from overâ after deportation ruling, say attorneys Mr Khalil's legal team has repeatedly said evidence of antisemitism has not been presented.  His lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, condemned the decision and said his team was going to fight for Mr Khalil's \"right to speak out against what's happening in the US\".  The legal team also said they expected further hearings in the case. \"I actually had a long conversation with him after the hearing,\" Johnny Sinodis, another member of Mr Khalil's legal team, told the BBC later on Friday. \"He's feeling confident. He's feeling supported.\" \"Mahmoud is not against the United States, he is not antisemitic,\" he said. \"He has done nothing wrong.\" Mr Khalil has also filed a federal court lawsuit in New Jersey challenging his arrest as unconstitutional. His lawyers have said the outcome of that case could block his deportation if they win. The Trump administration has separately alleged that the student committed immigration fraud by failing to disclose certain information on his green card application. This includes working for the British embassy in Beirut and the United Nations agency for Palestinian migrants and refugees. But the government has not submitted any new evidence related to this. In a statement, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers said the Trump administration is \"committed to the enforcement of our immigration laws and will take swift action to remove aliens who pose serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\".

        "title": "RFK Jr pledges to find the cause of autism 'by September'",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: RFK Jr says team will 'eliminate' exposures causing autism US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has pledged \"a massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism in five months. Experts cautioned that finding the causes of autism spectrum disorder â a complex syndrome that has been studied for decades â will not be straightforward, and called the effort misguided and unrealistic. Kennedy, who has promoted debunked theories suggesting autism is linked to vaccines, said during a cabinet meeting on Thursday that a US research effort will \"involve hundreds of scientists from around the world.\" \"By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures,\" Kennedy said. Autism diagnoses have increased sharply since 2000, according to government figures, and by 2020 the rate among 8-year-olds reached 2.77%, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Scientists attribute at least part of the rise to increased awareness of autism and an expanding definition of the disorder. Researchers have also been investigating environmental factors. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH), a government agency, spends more than $300m (Â£230m) per year researching autism.  The NIH lists some possible risk factors including prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, premature birth or low birth weight, maternal health problems and parents conceiving at older ages. Kennedy did not give details on the research project or how much funding will be devoted to autism research.  Since being sworn in two months ago, the former environmental lawyer has slashed the budget for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the NIH, CDC and other government health organisations that oversee food and drug safety and conduct disease research. Fact-checking RFK Jr's views on health policy \"We're going to look at vaccines, but we're going to look at everything,\" Kennedy later said during an interview with Fox News about the scope of the undertaking. \"Everything is on the table, our food system, our water, our air, different ways of parenting, all the kind of changes that may have triggered this epidemic.\" In a statement the Autism Society of America called Kennedy's plan \"harmful, misleading, and unrealistic\". \"It is neither a chronic illness nor a contagion,\" the society said. Christopher Banks, the society's president, questioned whether the research efforts would be transparent and said claims that autism is solely caused by environmental factors were \"misleading theories (which) perpetuate harmful stigma, jeopardize public health, and distract from the critical needs of the autism community.\" Kennedy has also alarmed some over his hiring of David Geier, who has been described by some as a conspiracy theorist, to research vaccines and autism, and on Thursday Democrats in the US House of Representatives wrote to HHS  \"to express our urgent concern\" over the selection of \"a biased and discredited individual\".  Geier is a leading vaccine sceptic who was fined by the state of Maryland for practicing medicine without a medical degree or licence and prescribing dangerous treatments to autistic children. The discredited idea that childhood vaccines are linked to autism first gained mainstream attention after a paper published in 1998 in the medical journal The Lancet by British doctor Andrew Wakefield. Wakefield was later found to have financial conflicts of interest and the UK's General Medical Council found that he falsified his results. The research paper was retracted.

        "content": "Josh Sullivan moved to South Africa in 2018  An American pastor has been kidnapped by armed men after they stormed his church service in South Africa, local authorities say.  Josh Sullivan had been conducting a service at Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell, a township in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape, on Thursday evening when \"four armed and masked male suspects entered\", police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge told the BBC. The men stole two phones before fleeing the church in the 45-year-old pastor's silver Toyota Fortuner. Police later found the vehicle abandoned, but there was no trace of Mr Sullivan. A spokesperson from the US State Department told the BBC that they were aware of the kidnapping of a US citizen in South Africa. They said there was no \"greater priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad\". Capt Beetge told the BBC the case had been handed to South Africa's elite police unit, known as the Hawks, which investigates serious organised and commercial crimes and high-level corruption. \"The police is currently following all possible leads to locate the victim and apprehend the perpetrators,\" said Hawks spokesman Lt Col Avele Fumba. Jeremy Hall, the Sullivan family's spokesman, told local newspaper TimesLive, external that he was at the church with his wife and their children when the incident took place.  \"They knew his name,\" he said.  Mr Sullivan's mother, Tonya Morton Rinker, wrote on Facebook that she was heartbroken over the news. She added: \"Our congressman and American embassy are working on finding him.\" No ransom has been requested, according to the privately-owned News24, external.  Mr Sullivan describes himself as \"a church planting missionary\" on his personal website.  On it, he says he moved to South Africa with his wife and children in 2018 to establish a church for Xhosa-speaking people.

        "title": "Ukraine allies pledge €21bn in fresh military support to Kyiv",
        "content": "European defence ministers pledged air defences, missiles and other gear Ukraine's European allies have pledged â¬21bn ($24bn; Â£18bn) in a new tranche of military support for Kyiv in what they described as \"a critical year\" for the war. More than half of this - â¬11bn in aid over four years - is coming from Germany. British Defence Minister John Healey said the pledges would send a strong signal to Moscow. The announcement came as members of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group met at Nato's headquarters in Brussels to pledge air defences, missiles and other gear as Europe sought to fill the gap left by the changed priorities of the US under Donald Trump. Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war, despite Trump's promise of a ceasefire. Support announced on Friday also includes a Â£450m ($590m) package from the UK and Norway to fund radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs and hundreds of thousands of drones for Ukraine. The money is part of a British pledge of Â£4.5bn made earlier this year. Air defence was a priority in Brussels. Healey said Russian forces had dropped 10,000 glide bombs on Ukraine in the first three months of this year, as well as launching 100 one-way attack drones a day. \"In our calculations, 70% to 80% of battlefield casualties are now caused and inflicted by drones,\" the UK defence secretary said. The German aid package meanwhile has a significant focus on artillery. Boris Pistorius said Germany would send 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, 25 infantry fighting vehicles, 15 battle tanks, 100 ground surveillance radars and 120 Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. Berlin will also send four IRIS-T air defence systems with 300 missiles to Kyiv. \"Ukraine needs a strong military and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,\" the German defence minister told reporters in Brussels. Defence ministers from 50 nations gathered in Brussels for the 27th gathering of the UDCG. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth joined the meeting remotely, telling allies that America appreciated their work. Pistorius said Hegseth's decision was a matter of \"schedules\" rather than \"priorities\", and that the \"most important fact was that he took part\". Zelensky confirms Ukraine troops in Russia's Belgorod region UK announces further Â£450m military support to Ukraine Other leaders also joined remotely, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  Kyiv's defence minister Rustem Umerov, who was in Brussels, thanked Europe for \"taking over the lead on security assistance\" for his country. He also said Hegseth's attendance \"means that the US is continuing its security assistance and is beside us\". Healey, Pistorius and Umerov all accused Russia of dragging its feet over a ceasefire.  Healey said it had been more than a month since Russia rejected a US-backed peace settlement. Pistorius said Russia was still not interested in peace.  Talks in Europe took place as US special envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia, once more, to press the Kremlin to accept a truce. Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Friday as Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the Ukraine war, but one should not expect any \"breakthroughs\". On the ground in Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the village of Zhuravka, in Ukraine's northern border region of Sumy. Ukrainian officials are yet to confirm this. Earlier this week, President Zelensky said as many as 67,000 Russian soldiers were positioned north of the border of the Sumy region, in preparation for an attack on the city of Sumy.

        "title": "Parliament recalled to debate emergency law to save British Steel",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Starmer announces plans to take control of British Steel plant Parliament has been recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure. Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to \"take control\" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces. The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying \"all options\" remained on the table. Talks have been taking place this week to keep production going at the firm, after owners Jingye said its blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\". Why is British Steel in trouble and who owns it? British Steel talks still deadlocked, source says Government considers nationalising British Steel  MPs and peers are currently on their Easter break and were not due to return until 22 April, but both are now going back to Westminster for the hastily convened sitting. Parliament sat on both Saturday and Sunday on the outbreak of World War Two in 1939. And there have been only five occasions since then when it sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law. Speaking at Downing Street on Friday, Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company \"hangs in the balance\". He said steelmaking was \"essential for our future\" and that he would always \"act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers\". \"Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,\" the prime minister said. The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel - another bill would be needed to do that.  Industry Minister Sarah Jones told BBC Breakfast the preference was for private investment alongside government funding to secure British Steel's future, but there was not currently a company \"that is there willing to invest at this point\". Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020, says it has invested more than Â£1.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around Â£700,000 a day. The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks. It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant \"who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership\" can be reinstated if they are sacked.  The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques. The government has offered Â£500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company. Earlier this week, the government offered to buy the coking coal to keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations. Jones said the government believed Jingye had \"not been acting in good faith\" over talks to agree a deal.  \"Things have reached an existential point where the company is refusing to bring in the raw materials we need to keep the blast furnaces running,\" she added. The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are \"no longer trustworthy partners\". The Scunthorpe site employs 2,700 people A 'Save Scunthorpe Steel' campaign will take place in the town on Saturday, including a parade at half-time during Scunthorpe United FC's match against Spennymoor Town. The football club is nicknamed The Iron, a reference to the town's connection with the steel industry. The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a \"reprieve\" while a longer-term solution is worked out. \"Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under,\" added general secretary Sharon Graham. The GMB union said the government's move looked like the \"first step\" towards nationalisation, which it supported as the \"only way to save the UK steel industry\". Steelworkers' union Community said the government could not allow the UK to become the only country in the G7 group of advanced economies \"without primary steelmaking capacity\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having \"bungled\" the negotiations with British Steel. \"They must have seen this coming for a while,\" she added. \"Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament.\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\". He added that his party would try to amend the emergency legislation to nationalise British Steel immediately, calling public ownership \"the only option we have to save this vital strategic asset\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said \"nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security\" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as \"an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production\".  The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the \"only sure way to secure this strategically important sector\". Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls.  The most recent sitting Saturday was 10 September 2022, when the House of Lords reconvened to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The House of Commons has been recalled 34 times since 1948.

        "title": "Michael Gove gets peerage in Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list",
        "content": "Michael Gove stood down from the Commons last year Michael Gove is among several ex-Conservative ministers to be given a seat in the House of Lords in Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list. The former housing and education secretary served in the cabinets of four prime ministers but stood down as an MP before last July's general election. Meanwhile, former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly have been awarded knighthoods. Outside of politics, England fast bowler James Anderson and filmmaker Matthew Vaughn have also been given knighthoods. Now editor of the Spectator magazine, Gove was MP for Surrey Heath for nearly 20 years. A key ally of Sunak, Gove was appointed his secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities in October 2022, a role he also held under Boris Johnson. Other cabinet roles he has held include environment secretary, justice secretary and education secretary. A leading figure in the Brexit campaign alongside Johnson, the pair had a fraught relationship. In 2016 Gove derailed his friend's leadership hopes by running against him. Later, in the dying days of Johnson's premiership he was sacked after urging the PM to resign. Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list in full What is the House of Lords and how does it work? Sue Gray among 30 newly appointed Labour peers Sir Jeremy was brought in by Liz Truss as chancellor after she sacked Kwasi Kwarteng following her disastrous mini-Budget. His moves to scrap almost all the tax cuts his predecessor had promised helped to calm financial markets. He continued the role under Sunak but returned to the backbenches when Kemi Badenoch took over as Conservative leader. The MP for Godalming and Ash, who first joined the Commons in 2005, has also served as culture secretary in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, foreign secretary and health secretary. Cleverly held the role of foreign secretary under Truss and Sunak, before moving to home secretary. He ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet of Sunak's successor, after he was unexpectedly knocked out of the leadership contest before the final round. The other Conservative figures knighted are former Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and former Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride, who currently serves as Badenoch's shadow chancellor. Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, who was first elected in 1987, has been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Others to be honoured include former Northern Ireland Secretary and Brexit campaigner Theresa Villiers, who is made a dame. Jeremy Hunt has served in four different cabinet roles Former Chief Whip Simon Hart and former Scottish Secretary Sir Alister Jack, who stepped down as MPs ahead of last summer's general election, are among those to get peerages. Sir Alister served as Scottish secretary from 2019 until he stood down, later receiving a knighthood in Sunak's previous round of honours in July 2024. During the election campaign, he was the most senior politician to be caught up in the row over government insiders gambling on the date of the poll. The former MP for Dumfries and  Galloway admitted placing three bets but has previously said he did not breach any rules and has not been investigated by the Gambling Commission. Hart spent nearly two years as Sunak's chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring MPs vote with the government. The publication of his parliamentary diaries last month, which included stories of an MP being trapped in a brothel and politicians demanding knighthoods, caused a stir in Westminster and were criticised by some Tories for revealing the secrets of his time in government. Also joining the House of Lords are former Transport Secretary Mark Harper, former Attorney General Victoria Prentis, former Conservative Party chief executive Stephen Massey and Eleanor Shawcross, who ran Sunak's policy unit in Downing Street.  Meanwhile, it was confirmed former Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman has been given a peerage, after being nominated by Badenoch.  Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the honours were \"rewards for the failure of a dreadful Conservative government that was rightly kicked out of office\".  The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours â often key allies, donors and staff. Members of the House of Lords are unelected and scrutinise the work of government. They receive a daily tax-free allowance of Â£361 plus travel expenses. Most are nominated by party leaders and are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Legislation to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords is currently making its way through Parliament. When he was in opposition, Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with an elected chamber. However, this pledge was then watered down, with Labour's manifesto only promising to consult on proposals for an alternative second chamber. In December, Sir Keir awarded 30 new peerages, including a string of ex-MPs and his former chief of staff Sue Gray.

        "title": "Tell Your Papa: Nigeria government bans Eedris Abdulkareem's song criticising President Tinubu",
        "content": "Artist Eedris Abdulkareem has long been a critic of government policies The Nigerian authorities have banned broadcasters from playing the song Tell Your Papa, which criticises the country's leader. Artist Eedris Abdulkareem's lyrics slam President Bola Tinubu and urge his influential son, Seyi, to let his father know \"people are dying\" through hardship and insecurity and there is \"hunger\" in the country. In a letter to TV and radio stations, the National Broadcast Commission (NBC), which issues licenses and regulates the industry, ordered the track not to be played, saying it violates the country's broadcast code. The NBC said it considered Tell Your Papa's content to be \"inappropriate\" and \"objectionable\" adding that it falls short of public decency standards. Released earlier in the week, the song has gained a lot of attention on social media in Nigeria and has sparked debate regarding the economic and security situation in the country. On becoming president in May 2023, Tinubu introduced a number of economic reforms which increased the cost of living. He dropped the fuel subsidy, which had long kept petrol prices low, saying that the government could no longer afford it. Fuel prices then jumped sharply which had a knock-on effect on the rest of the economy. Annual inflation was above 30% for most of last year and the price of some basic food items increased by even more. This has led some Nigerians to cut back on the number of meals they eat a day and the amount of food they consume. There are also worries about the level of insecurity in the country with kidnapping-for-ransom still a major issue and fears that Islamist militant group Boko Haram could make a resurgence in the north-east. On the track, in a mix of English, Yoruba and Pidgin, Abdulkareem tells Tinubu's son that his father \"is not trying\" and that he has made \"too many empty promises\". When it comes to insecurity, the artist urges Seyi to travel by road, instead of private jet, to experience the dangers faced by ordinary Nigerians. Tinubu's government has in the past defended its economic policies saying that the president was aiming to put the country on a stable footing in the long term. In order to deal with the short-term pain, the authorities have an on-going cash transfer scheme to help 15 million poorer Nigerian households.

        "title": "US fires Greenland military base chief for 'undermining' JD Vance",
        "content": "Col Susannah Meyers (left) was fired after reportedly distancing herself from JD Vance's remarks The head of the US military base in Greenland has been fired after she reportedly sent an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark. The US military's Space Operations Command said Col Susannah Meyers had been removed from her role at Pituffik Space Base due to a \"loss of confidence in her ability to lead\". Last month, Vance said Denmark had \"not done a good job\" for Greenlanders and had not spent enough on security while visiting the Danish territory. The alleged email, released by a military news site, told staff Vance's comments were \"not reflective\" of the base. A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying \"undermining\" US leadership was not tolerated. This video can not be played Watch: JD and Usha Vanceâs trip to Greenlandâ¦in 80 seconds Following Vance's trip, on 31 March, Col Meyers is reported to have written: \"I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice-President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.\" Military.com - which published the email, external - said the contents had been confirmed as accurate to them by the US Space Force. Appearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\" The Space Force's statement announcing Col Meyers' removal on Thursday said that Col Shawn Lee was replacing her.  It added: \"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties.\"  Col Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year. Col Lee was previously a squadron commander at the Clear Space Force Station in Alaska. During his whirlwind trip, Vance had also reiterated Trump's desire to annex Greenland for security reasons.  Since the US delegation's visit, both Greenland and Denmark have shown a united front, opposing a US annexation of the autonomous Danish territory. Earlier this month, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's official visit saw her stand side-by-side with her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen and his predecessor, Mute Egede. Speaking to reporters, Frederiksen directly addressed Trump, telling him: \"You can't annex other countries.\" She added that Denmark was fortifying its military presence in the Arctic, and offered closer collaboration with the US in defending the region. The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland as a strategically important territory. It has had a military presence on the island since occupying it following the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany during World War Two. \"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, previously told the BBC. \"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\" Greenland, the world's largest island, has been under Danish control for around 300 years.  Polls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to gain independence from Denmark - but do not wish to become part of the US. Greenland has had the right to call an independence referendum since 2009, though in recent years some political parties have begun pushing harder for one to take place.

        "title": "Wildfire battles continue with 'extreme' warning in place",
        "content": "Fire crews remain at the scene of a large wildfire near Cumbernauld The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has urged the public to \"act responsibly\" as an extreme wildfire warning remains in place across the country. Firefighters worked through the night to tackle a number of blazes across Scotland, including one at Glen Rosa on the Isle of Arran. Meanwhile crews are expected to be working through the night to tackle a large grass fire in Cumbernauld which broke out on Thursday evening. Wildfire warnings have been issued at the highest level for Friday and Saturday following a long period of dry weather. This video can not be played Drone footage shows wildfire blazing in the hills above Cumbernauld In Cumbernauld, firefighters were called to reports of the blaze near Fannyside Loch at 20:40 on Thursday. By 22:00 on Friday four fire engines were still at the scene, though operations were being scaled back. Firefighters are expected to remain at the site through the night. A fire service spokesperson earlier urged members of the public to avoid the area and said those who live locally should close windows and doors. Firefighters also contained a wild blaze on an area of dunes and grass near a gas plant in Peterhead. Crews were called to the area near the St Fergus Gas Terminal at about 13:00 - including a specialist wildfire unit and five fire engines - and left at about 19:40. Some of the locations where wildfires have broken out across Scotland in the last week Some properties in Cumbernauld were evacuated overnight including a dog kennel and cattery. Eran Yehudai, the owner of Crowbank Kennels and Cattery told BBC Scotland News he had to evacuate 25 dogs and 10 cats from the premises. He said: \"I was putting the dogs to bed as we do every evening but when I got out of the kennels I could see a red sky. \"Within a few minutes the fire was getting closer, we started seeing flames and by about 22:30 we decided we have no choice but to evacuate all the animals.\" He called in help from staff and a neighbour who each packed their cars with crates to transport the animals away from the fire. Eran Yehudai had to evacuate his kennels near Cumbernauld \"When they were leaving there was already flames on the road, they were weaving between the flames - it was quite worrying and scary,\" he said. Mr Yehudai was escorted back to the property by a fire chief so that he could get the last five dogs to safety. They returned early the following morning but are concerned they could end up have to evacuate again. \"Throughout the day I have seen smoke coming from the ground again, I take it there is a concern that the fire might reignite and we might find ourselves in the situation all over again,\" he said. Flames from the Glen Rosa fire could be seen from Brodick on Arran Councillor Adam Smith said locals in the nearest residential area, Abronhill, were concerned. He told BBC Scotland News: \"The glow from the fire lit up the sky for miles around. \"People were really alarmed and asking if they had to evacuate.\" Smith, the SNP member for Cumbernauld East, also said residents in Airdrie and Coatbridge - up to 10 miles away - reported seeing the blaze. The councillor said there had been a number of wildfires in the area but this was the \"most significant\" he had seen. Fannyside Road is closed between Forest Road and Greengairs Road with the public urged to avoid the area. A large grassfire also took hold at Glen Rosa on the Isle of Arran at about 13:00 on Thursday. Three crews were sent to the scene, with one remaining on Friday morning. Police have told hillwalkers there will be no access to the popular Goatfell walk due to public safety. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Michael Humphreys urged people to act responsibly in rural areas. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"What we see is the majority of fires, it is human behaviour that starts the fire in the first place.\" \"Enjoy the countryside, it is a sunny day today, but act responsibly. \"If you normally use a barbecue maybe think about taking a picnic instead or using a designated area. \"Take all your litter home, glass can reflect and start a fire and if you do smoke just make sure your cigarette is absolutely fully out.\" Wildfires have been extinguished in Skye, Aberdeen, Thurso, Rothesay, Bonhill, the Galloway Forest Park and the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh in recent days. The extreme warning will remain in place until Saturday with temperatures set to cool over the weekend.

        "title": "Dog attacks up across England and Wales over past five years",
        "content": "The data does not take into account the breed of dog or the types of injury caused Police forces across the country have seen an increase in the number of dog attacks on people during the past five years. English and Welsh police forces said annual totals for the number of offences recorded of an out-of-control dog causing injury were on the up. It comes amid deaths from XL Bully attacks in Bristol and Cheshire in recent weeks. Cleveland Police saw the highest increase at 163% - with 363 incidents reported in 2024 compared with 138 in 2019 - four other forces also saw increases of more than 100%. One victim, who was attacked by a border terrier, said she \"noticed that blood was just pumping out of my leg, I was in agony\". There were 32,568 recorded offences nationwide in 2024 - a 4% increase on 2023's total of 31,398, according to Freedom of Information figures obtained by the BBC from every police force in England and Wales. In Gloucestershire the number of cases reported to police went up by 70% from 204 incidents in 2019, to 346 last year. In Wiltshire and Avon and Somerset cases rose by just over 50%.  All forces saw an upward trend in attacks - with South Yorkshire reporting the lowest increase at 22%. Cheshire and Northamptonshire were not able to offer data up to 2024 and Northumbria use a different method for counting dog attacks. City of London Police do not collect figures as such incidents are handled by the Metropolitan Police. The data takes into account all recorded dog attacks and does not offer information on breed or severity of injury. The actual attack figures are likely to be higher as the data only counts incidents that were reported to police. Judy Champion was walking home in West Somerset when an elderly man with three dogs parked alongside her. \"As I passed, the dog shot out [of the car] and grabbed onto my leg,\" she said. \"I shouted at the man 'your dog's bit me, your dog's bit me' and he just pulled the dog back, said sorry and walked off.\" Ms Champion had her wound bandaged up and was given a tetanus shot and a course of penicillin to resist against any infections. She said she was left with a deep wound, which left her in \"agony\" and is still healing more than two months after the incident. Judy Champion was bitten by a dog in February and her wounds are still healing Ms Champion is also a dog owner herself and said the experience had left her wary of other people's pets. \"I'm not scared of dogs,\" she said. \"But now I'm looking out for dogs all the time even though I have two of my own.\" The incident happened outside a primary school on a weekday morning. \"There are people coming in and out all the time, it could have happened to anybody,\" she added. Avon and Somerset Police, which covers the area where Ms Champion lives, saw a 56% increase in dog attacks between 2019 and 2024. The owner of the dog that bit Ms Champion could not be identified so no action was taken. Family of XL bully victim 'absolutely devastated' What are the rules for having an XL bully dog?

        "title": "Charity hits £30k goal to replace Attenborough Nature Reserve bridge",
        "content": "The bridge, known as the Works Bridge, had to close due to safety issues A wildlife trust forced to close a popular footbridge at a nature reserve has reached its Â£30,000 goal from a public appeal to replace it.  The Works Bridge at Attenborough Nature Reserve, near Beeston in Nottinghamshire, closed to the public in April 2023 after a safety inspection. In September 2024, Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust announced it would commit to replacing the bridge altogether, with the entire project expected to cost Â£375,000.  Head of communications Erin McDaid says hitting the latest fundraising milestone has been a \"really positive\" development.  The trust said bridge construction firm Beaver Bridges would be making the new structure \"It just shows the strength of feeling and support for the reserve, and people understand our challenge of actually having a lot of infrastructure to maintain on the reserve,\" he said. The trust said it had previously earmarked Â£85,000 of its existing funds towards  the project and has had a further Â£90,000 in pledges, but the remaining target will be generated by further fundraising. Mr McDaid said as well as its own funds and the public appeal, the money for the bridge had come from grant-making trusts, private donations and partner donations.  The Works Bridge - which forms part of an existing bridleway - was initially closed before the trust purchased the reserve. Mr McDaid said the trust had \"put on pressure\" for the bridge to be reopened before buying the site in 2020, but it was only reopened as a footpath, as it could not be repaired to a standard required for a bridleway.  Later in 2023, another safety inspection of the bridge identified it was no longer safe for anybody to use, and it was then fully closed.  Mr McDaid said: \"It has been quite contentious. It's unfortunately been closed for quite some considerable time. \"It had also been closed previously for a period before we took ownership of the site, so it has been a real source of frustration for visitors residents and of course ourselves.\" Now, preparation work has been complete with a design released for how the new bridge could look.  The bridges at the site were designed to accommodate the barge traffic that once travelled through the site when it was a gravel quarry.  The trust did not have a set date for the installation of the new bridge, but said its next steps would include submitting a planning application to the local authority.

        "title": "UK economy grew more than expected in February",
        "content": "The UK economy grew by more than predicted in February and exports to the US increased by Â£500m as businesses rushed to beat US tariffs. The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived. Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week. Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said. \"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). \"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said. Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production. The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards. Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\". She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\". \"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added. The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth. Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\". Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters. How fast is the UK's economy growing? What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth. Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%. This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years. However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark. But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\". \"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\" While there is an acknowledgement that the uncertainty from US tariffs poses threats to the economy, some experts believe it may also create opportunities for a the UK as a stable, growing trade-friendly economy. Mitchell Barnes is now planning on taking on fewer staff than he had hoped to Mitchell Barnes runs a 3D printing company in Warwickshire, designing and manufacturing parts for the automotive industry. Half of the parts made here are exported to the US.  But rather than Trump tariffs, he says it is domestic factors that are hitting his business. Mr Barnes says this month's changes to National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage mean he may need to rethink his plan to create new jobs at the site. He had hoped to increase his number of staff from 27 to 100 over the next 18 months, but has now lowered that to between 30 to 40. The business is now looking to accelerate plans to expand in the United States instead. \"Ultimately, for us, it's all about innovating in order to control our own destiny.\" Additional reporting by Adam Woods Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.

        "content": "Two American Airlines jet have had a minor collision on the ground at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport - just three months after a deadly crash near there.  The Federal Aviation Administration said the wingtip of one aircraft struck another on the taxiway on Thursday afternoon. Six members of Congress were aboard one of the jets. Nick LaLota, a New York Republican, said no-one was hurt when the wing of their stationary plane was \"bumped\" by another jet.   Sixty-seven people died on 29 January when an Army helicopter collided in midair with a jetliner as it landed at the same airport. LaLota posted on X: \"Serving in Congress has come with some once in a lifetime experiencesâ¦ like just now while stationary on the runway at DCA, another plane just bumped into our wing.\"  \"Heading back to the gate, but thankfully everyone is ok,\" LaLota added.  He said his colleague, Grace Meng, a New York Democrat, was handing out grapes to passengers on the plane.  She posted on X: \"I'm grateful no one was hurt today.\" In addition to Meng and LaLota, congressman Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat and congressman Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, confirmed they were on board the flight, too.  Two of those lawmakers said that New York congressmen  Adriano Espaillat and Ritchie Torres, both Democrats, were also aboard that craft. The Federal Aviation Administration said: \"The wingtip of American Airlines Flight 5490 struck American Airlines Flight 4522 on a taxiway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport around 12:45pm local time on Thursday, April 10. \"Flight 5490, a Bombardier CRJ 900, was headed to Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. Flight 4522, an Embraer E175, was headed to JFK International Airport in New York. The FAA will investigate.\" Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport said in a statement that there was no impact on flight operations, and both aircraft returned to gates with no injuries reported. American Airlines said 76 customers were aboard Flight 5490 and 67 customers were on the other plane, and no injuries were reported. \"Safety is our top priority,\" the airline said in an emailed statement, \"and we apologize to our customers for their experience.\" \"Both aircraft taxied to the terminal and have been taken out of service to be inspected by our maintenance teams,\" the statement continued. \"The damage was limited to a winglet on each aircraft.\" An investigation is still ongoing into January's deadly crash involving an American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, that was landing at Reagan National Airport when it collided with a Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter. The cause of that disaster remains unknown, but a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that some helicopter operations near the airport be banned.

        "title": "The pioneering child development study monitoring babies’ brains",
        "content": "Researchers are using specially designed games and brain-scanning 'hats' to work out how children develop key skills  Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal. It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making. It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn. Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain. The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities. But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s. The waiting room is full of toys and games, set up especially for young children A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents. For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says. \"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\" Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.  \"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\" During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains. The games help researchers measure how skills like working memory and impulse control develop in babies and toddlers Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too. \"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\" This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.  \"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\" Hundreds of babies and toddlers taking part in this new study are the children of people who have been studied since the 1990s, In another room, Jaxon, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory. A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jaxon can keep all the stickers he finds. \"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read. \"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\" The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information. This findings of this study could help scientists support children who might struggle academically or socially, before they start school The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health. The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers. One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact, external on their health and development. Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet. And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind, external. In this latest study â of the children of the children of the 90s â scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school. Emily (pictured here as a young child in her mother's arms) is a child of the 90s Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles. \"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\" Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set. \"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\" Henry and Jaxon finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats. \"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.  \"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\" City's 'world-beating' study awarded Â£5.2m grant First gathering in decade for 1990s children study Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "title": "Oldest Post Office victim says new compensation 'not good enough'",
        "content": "The oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal has rejected an increased offer of compensation, saying it is \"still not good enough\". Betty Brown, 92, was originally offered less than a third of what she had claimed for, but she has now received a new offer of 60%. However the former sub-postmistress told the BBC justice was still being denied. Post Office minister Gareth Thomas, who had previously promised to look at her case, said it was always the government's priority to pay as much redress as it could. Betty said she was forced out of her branch in Country Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent more than Â£50,000 of their savings to cover shortfalls that did not exist. It was the faulty software that made it look like money was missing from their branch. Her post office had been one of the most successful in the region but she was later forced to sell it at a loss. The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully accused of theft, with many being prosecuted and some even being sent to jail. The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK, and was the subject of ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\". \"It absolutely destroyed my whole life,\" she told the BBC. She thanked Mr Thomas for helping her but said there was \"still a long way to go to get the justice that we were promised\". Betty has been waiting 26 years for things to be put right. \"We're just getting fobbed off. The evidence is all there,\" she said. More than Â£892m has now been paid to over 6,200 claimants across four different compensation schemes, according to the latest government figures. But a group of MPs in January said compensation is not being paid quickly enough, and called for changes to the way redress was being delivered. Mrs Brown was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Alan Bates against the post office. And she is seeking her compensation via the GLO scheme, established just over three years ago. Betty's story has become a high-profile case. Mr Thomas was pressed about it on BBC's Newsnight in January, where he promised to look into her case. He met Betty and several other victims the following day. Although Betty's offer has now increased from 29% to 60% of her claim it is still far less than what she says experts told her she could expect. News of her revised offer will not be encouraging for other victims also embroiled in disputes over what is full and fair redress. Post Office Minister Mr Thomas said he can \"understand the frustration when lawyers are not able to reach an agreement on a claim\". \"It is always our priority to pay as much redress as we can, and in some cases, we have been able to offer more than has been claimed,\" he said, adding that the government would take \"further steps to quickly and fairly resolve\" challenges in disputes such as Betty's.\" Betty is determined fight on to get what she still believes she is owed. Chairman of the Business ad Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, said he was concerned about some victims facing a \"significant\" write-down of their claims when their initial offer is tabled. He has written to Mr Thomas with a series of questions on fairness of offers, delays and transparency. Have you been personally affected by the Post Office scandal?

        "title": "Hudson river: What we know about the fatal helicopter crash",
        "content": "Four people were pronounced dead at the scene with two others being pronounced dead after being taken to local hospitals The New York Police Department (NYPD) has said a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River and killed all six people onboard including a family of five from Spain. It is very much an active investigation, but here is what we know so far about the fatal crash: New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch has given some details about the fatal helicopter ride. She said the helicopter was operated by New York Helicopters and took off from the  Downtown Skyport on the lower side of Manhattan at 14:59 local time (19:59 BST). According to the popular real-time flight-tracking website Flightradar24, the helicopter was in the air for about 15 minutes. It started its route heading towards the Statue of Liberty and pivoted north towards the George Washington Bridge. Then, the helicopter circled back down the Hudson along the New Jersey side and plunged into the River Hudson near a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey, at 15:15 local time (20:15 BST). The helicopter was upside-down when it hit the water, Tisch added. Hudson River helicopter crash kills family of five Police boats assisted in the rescue efforts and Bruce Wall, who was nearby when the crash happened, described what he saw. \"It started falling apart in mid-air and then the tail came off and then just flipped over in mid-air and started falling to the ground,\" he said. In total there were six people onboard the helicopter when it went down - including one American pilot. According to reports, the Spanish family of two adults and three children were taking the helicopter ride to see sights of New York. While authorities have yet to release their identities, the family has widely been named as AgustÃ­n Escobar and his wife MercÃ¨ CamprubÃ­ Montal, who were both executives at Siemens, and their children, aged four, five and 11. Dive teams worked to recover the bodies and despite CPR efforts, all six people were pronounced dead. Four victims were pronounced dead on scene, the other two victims were pronounced dead at an area hospital, officials have said. This video can not be played Watch: New York mayor confirms six deaths from helicopter crash The cause of the crash is currently under investigation and early details are vague. But, NYPD Commissioner Tisch has said the \"aircraft lost control\" and hit the water \"just a few feet off the coast of a pier\". The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said the helicopter was a Bell 206.  Both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will investigate - with the NTSB leading the investigation. Thursday's incident was the deadliest helicopter crash in New York City since at least 2018, according to the New York Times. In that incident, all five passengers drowned and only the pilot survived when a sightseeing helicopter that was flying with its doors off fell into the East River and flipped over.

        "title": "Defence secretary pledges £450m military 'surge' to Ukraine",
        "content": "A Ukrainian soldier during training in February 2025 The government has announced a further Â£450m of military support to Kyiv, as the UK and Germany hosted a meeting of 50 nations in Brussels.  Defence officials met to \"pile pressure\" on Russian President Vladimir Putin and force him to end his invasion of Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary John Healey said. \"We must step up to deter Russian aggression by continuing to bolster Ukraine's defences,\" he added.  The package includes funding for hundreds of thousands of drones, anti-tanks mines and and repairs to military vehicles.  War in Ukraine live updates Starmer accuses Putin of 'playing games' over Ukraine peace deal About Â£350m will be provided by the UK, with extra funding from Norway via the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine. The package includes Â£160m to provide repairs and maintenance to vehicles and equipment the UK has already provided to Ukraine. A \"close fight\" military aid package, with funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones, worth more than Â£250m is also part of the package, the government said. In January, the UK pledged Â£4.5bn in military aid to Ukraine - which Healey described as the highest contribution of aid to Ukraine this year. The Â£450m announced on Friday is part of that Â£4.5bn.  Ukraine's long-range drones using Western tech to hit Russia How drones and the battle for Ukraine are changing the future of warfare Speaking after a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group (UDCG), Healey said Ukraine's allies in total pledged â¬21bn (Â£18.2bn) in new military aid to the embattled nation - which he called a record boost in funding. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, who co-chaired the meeting alongside Healey, said \"major progress\" was made. He said Germany committed to providing an additional â¬11bn worth of aid to Ukraine until 2029. \"Peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future,\" Pistorius said at a news conference. \"Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting,\" he said, adding that Ukraine \"can count on us\" for support. Who has supplied the most military aid to Ukraine? Last month, Sir Keir Starmer announced a Â£1.6bn missile deal for Ukraine, on top of a Â£2.2bn loan to provide more military aid backed by profits from frozen Russian assets. The Lib Dems said the support package announced on Friday was \"small change\" and called for the government to seize Russian assets in Britain to give Ukraine more funding.  The UDCG had traditionally been hosted by the US defence secretary until Donald Trump became president in January. Since then, in a sign of the US stepping back from European security matters, Healey has taken over as chair.  Healey said US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth did, however, attend Friday's meeting virtually, as did Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Asked by the BBC whether the US had the right priorities given Hegseth had not attended the meeting in person, Pistorius said it was \"not a matter of priorities, it's a matter of schedules\".  He added that as far as he was aware, Hegseth had just returned from a trip abroad and other ministers had also not been able to attend for similar reasons. \"The most important part was that he took part,\" he said. \"In the weeks to come, we will see what will happen with US participation and US support,\" Pistorius added, but said Europe should \"take on more responsibility\". Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said the US remains his country's \"prime partner\" and it was still participating and \"providing security assistance\". On Thursday, defence ministers from 30 countries in the \"coalition of the willing\" -  a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine - met in Brussels to discuss installing a force in Ukraine to ensure enduring peace. During that meeting, Healey said he did not envisage a peacekeeping force that would \"separate the currently warring sides down the line of contact\" but that bolstering Ukraine's armies would be a key part of the plan. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the role of a peacekeeping force in Ukraine needed to be discussed further. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: \"If we have such boots on the ground, so what is the goal? Are they monitoring, are they deterring, are they keeping the peace, are they fighting? I mean, what could be the goal? And that's not really clear.\" Trump once said he would end the war in Ukraine in less than 24 hours, but so far, his attempts to stop the conflict have only resulted in limited success. In March, Putin rejected Trump's call for an immediate and full month-long ceasefire - which Kyiv had agreed to - instead saying only that it would halt attacks on energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Russia on Friday, where he is set to meet Putin, according the TASS news agency.  The spokesman said the pair will discuss the conflict but warned not to expect \"breakthroughs\", state media reported.  Meanwhile, fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops has intensified in the past week, according to Ukrainian military chiefs, who said assaults on the front line have increased by 30%. It is thought these assaults are part of a spring offensive by Russia. Kyiv believes Moscow is preparing for a major renewed assault, with tens of thousands of troops believed to have gathered along the border with Ukraine. Earlier this week, Zelensky publicly acknowledged for the first time that his troops are active in Russia's Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian troops have also been fighting in Russia's Kursk region - though Russia has since retaken most of the territory.

        "title": "Supreme Court instructs Trump to return man wrongly deported to El Salvador jail",
        "content": "The US Supreme Court has ruled unanimously that the Trump administration must try to release a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to a mega-jail in El Salvador. In a 9-0 ruling, the justices declined to block a lower court's order to \"facilitate\" bringing back Kilmar Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, but they also said Judge Paula Xinis may have exceeded her authority. On Friday Judge Xinis directed the Trump administration to provide her with daily updates on what steps they are taking to bring Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a back to the US.  The government has conceded Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a was deported due to an \"administrative error\", though it also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his lawyer denies. Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, a Salvadorean, is one of dozens of alleged gang member migrants placed by the US on military planes last month and flown to El Salvador's notorious Cecot (Terrorism Confinement Centre) under an arrangement between the two countries. Following the Supreme Court's order, lawyers for the Trump administration went in front of Judge Xinis of the Maryland district court on Friday to explain how they will release Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a.  The judge had asked the government to explain by that morning how they planned to bring Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a back, but justice department attorneys filed a motion asking for the deadline to be extended until Tuesday evening. In a two-page filing, government lawyers called her deadlines \"impracticable\". During an at-times tense hearing that lasted about half an hour, Judge Xinis repeatedly pressed the justice department for specifics on Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's whereabouts. \"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" she said. \"I'm asking a very simple question: where is he?\" Judge Xinis ultimately ruled that the government must provide her with daily updates on Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's location and status, what efforts it had previously taken to get him back to the US and what efforts it will undertake.  In court documents, Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's lawyers accused the government of trying to \"delay, obfuscate and flout court orders, while a man's life and safety is at risk\". Can the US return man deported to El Salvador? In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court last week, the Trump administration argued that Judge Xinis lacked the authority to issue the order to return Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a by Monday night, and that US officials could not compel El Salvador to return him. US Solicitor General Dean John Sauer wrote in his emergency court filing: \"The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.\" The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issued its decision in an unsigned order on Thursday. The justices did not give the administration a deadline for when Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a should be freed. They said Judge Xinis may have exceeded her authority when she required the Trump administration to \"effectuate\" Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's return. \"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the Supreme Court order said.  This video can not be played Watch: 'I miss you so much', says wife of Salvadorean deported by mistake On Friday, President Donald Trump told reporters that if the Supreme Court said \"bring somebody back I would do that\". \"I respect the Supreme Court,\" he said. A justice department spokesperson told the BBC that the Supreme Court correctly recognised \"it is the exclusive prerogative of the president to conduct foreign affairs\". \"By directly noting the deference owed to the executive branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the president's authority to conduct foreign policy.\" Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, 29, entered the US illegally as a teenager from El Salvador. In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities. But an immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from local gangs in his home country. Democratic Senator Chis Van Hollen, who represents Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, said the case marks a \"troubling moment\" for the US when it comes to the rule of law.  \"It took them only 72 hours to illegally abduct Abrego Garcia and take him out of the country to El Salvador,\" Van Hollen told BBC News. \"They can get them back in 72 hours or less, and they need to do that. And they need to do it now.\" Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's wife, Jennifer VÃ¡squez Sura, is a US citizen and has been calling for his release since his deportation. \"I will continue fighting until my husband is home,\" she told the New York Times on Thursday.

        "title": "New pill can slow progression of incurable breast cancer",
        "content": "Linda says the drug has given her extra years of life Linda Kelly, 67, has advanced breast cancer which has spread to her bones and chest wall, but says a new pill has given her extra years of life and time to travel with her husband. \"It does let you have a normal kind of life and you forget you have cancer,\" she says of the new drug capivasertib, which has been recommended for NHS use in England and Wales, and is funded from today in England. Linda is one of more than 1,000 women with incurable breast cancer who could benefit from the drug, which can slow progression of the disease. It's another possible treatment option for those with this cancer - but a charity said breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly. Linda is a keen gardener who keeps active by cycling 60 miles a week and also does pilates. She says she's had \"fantastic\" results from the new drug, which is taken twice daily in tablet form. The side-effects for her were minimal and it's allowed her to go on holiday to New Zealand with her husband Neil last year and plan a trip to the US this year. \"You feel the drug is working and you can be a lot calmer - it's given me nearly four years of extra time,\" she says. She says the drug has also given her hope. \"It does make you think about your life, and what you want to do with your life in the future - but at least you feel well enough to make those plans and confident enough as well to fulfil some of those plans.\" But not everyone is likely to have such positive results from the drug.  In trials, in 708 women,, external when combined with hormone therapy, external, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months, and shrank tumours in 23% of patients. \"It presents a very effective option that can work for a long time - many months, and in some people it can be years,\" said Prof Nick Turner, lead researcher and professor of medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research and The Royal Marsden. \"It can substantially delay chemotherapy which many women fear because of the side-effects,\" he added. \"Advanced breast cancer is highly treatable and we want kinder, better treatments.\" The drug, which has been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), will be funded through the Cancer Drugs Fund in England and via health boards in Wales. Prof Nick Turner researched the drug over many years Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with one in seven women affected in their lifetimes and 75% surviving for 10 years or more after diagnosis.  If the cancer returns and spreads to other parts of the body, treatments aim to control it, reduce the symptoms and improve quality of life. Possible treatments include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drugs that help to stop the cancer growing - either by blocking hormones, boosting the body's immune system or targeting what makes cancer cells grow. This new drug capivasertib is a targeted therapy. It works in a new way, blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT which drives cancer growth.  Scientists started working on the drug's development 20 years ago and say it's the most effective cancer drug they've seen for advanced cancer. AstraZeneca is the manufacturer of capivasertib. The drug is suitable for those with certain gene mutations that affect up to half of people with hormone receptor positive secondary breast cancer - the most common type, which grows in the presence of oestrogen. Prof Peter Johnson, clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said it offered \"an additional option\" for some whose cancer has progressed despite previous hormone therapy - but it wouldn't be suitable for everyone. Claire Rowney, chief executive at charity Breast Cancer Now, said she was \"delighted\" that the drug would offer some people \"the hope of more precious time to do what matters most to them\". But she said patients had \"faced unnecessary delays in accessing it\" after the drug was initially rejected by NICE, and breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly for those who need them. \"NHS England must now put in place prompt genetic testing to ensure those eligible receive capivasertib without further delay,\" she said, adding that Scotland should also consider funding the treatment quickly so that patients across the UK would have access.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Johnson said NICE had to work through the evidence when approving new drugs for the NHS, and those discussions included how much the drug will cost. \"We have to make sure the treatments we bring in are good value for money for the NHS and come in under the cost threshold that we expect, because obviously, particularly in these hard times, money is not plentiful and we need to make sure that the price of the drug and the way it's being used really do constitute... good value for money for the NHS,\" said Prof Johnson. NICE says it has approved 24 out of 25 breast cancer treatments it has assessed over the past seven years.

        "title": "Investors facing tariff turmoil: 'It's fastest finger first'",
        "content": "As a former champion runner, Richard McDonald can move quickly.  But the speed of the market falls, triggered by the sweeping global tariffs Donald Trump announced last week, still kept him on his toes. Previously a trader for Credit Suisse, he now buys and sells stocks privately. At his laptop in London last week, he watched as the president unveiled a poster board outlining tariff rates, some as high as 50%, for imports from countries around the world. He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.  \"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first',\" he said. \"My mind was sprinting.\" In 25 years of trading, he said he had rarely experienced anything like it. Trillions were wiped off the value of financial markets around the world in the aftermath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement.  Leading share indexes in the US and UK saw some of the steepest declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, dropping more than 10% over three days.  Oil prices sank and so did the dollar.  By Wednesday, the worries had spread to the bond market, as investors started dumping US government debt, usually a safe haven for investors in times of uncertainty. When Trump announced he was putting some of the most eye-watering tariffs on pause, shares stopped sliding and rallied.  But the market turmoil was far from over.  Trump left in place a tariff of 10% on imports from most countries and a tariff of 145% on goods from China, America's third largest source of imports after the European Union and Mexico. A day after the announcement, the S&P 500 dropped another 3.5%, the Dow slid 2.5% and the Nasdaq fell 4.3%. At St Louis-based Argent Capital Management, the mood, said portfolio manager Jed Ellerbroek, was \"still miserable\". Some of his firm's holdings, like health insurance giant United Healthcare, have done well over the last week, as investors look for companies likely to be able to weather the tariff storm. But his third largest investment is Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones and other products in China. \"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said.  \"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said. \"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said.  Faced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics. \"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\" While Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year.  \"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said. \"We're just back trading again on the broader long-term outlook of the tariff implications, which is still negative.\" Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Police raid barbers and vape shops suspected of being fronts for crime gangs",
        "content": "This video can not be played Police raided 265 businesses, including barbers, mini-marts and vape shops Police officers smash through the back doors of a bright, modern barber shop in the market town of Shrewsbury. Inside they immediately detain two men - who we are later told are Kurdish asylum seekers. Both men are later released. It is the first of six raids that day where police seize thousands of pounds in cash and illicit vapes. The officers are here with a warrant to search the premises because of suspected money laundering. They say their intelligence also suggests the shop is linked to sale of illicit cigarettes and vapes, illegal immigration and drug-dealing. Det Insp Daniel Fenn, on his ninth raid of the week, says some barber shops such as this are claiming income of Â£100,000 to Â£150,000 a month. \"They aren't getting that amount of customers to warrant that amount of money.\" CCTV in other barbers that have been raided has shown they do not have many customers, so footage of this one will also be examined, DI Fenn says. The raid in Shrewsbury was one of 265 carried out across England and Wales last month as part of a crackdown on High Street businesses - often Turkish-style barbers, vape shops and mini-marts - suspected of being fronts for international crime gangs. Politicians and members of the public have raised concerns about many of these businesses which have boomed even while High Streets appear to be in decline. The average number of barbers per person in England and Wales has doubled in the past 10 years, according to commercial property analysts Green Street. Now the National Crime Agency (NCA) says it has launched the crackdown, called Operation Machinize, in response to growing intelligence reports that some of these shops are being used for money laundering - where gangs falsely present the proceeds of criminal operations as if they were earnings from legitimate businesses handling large amounts of cash. Det Insp Daniel Fenn, searching a barber shop, says criminals feel they can hide in quiet neighbourhoods Despite these shops operating openly for years on High Streets and attracting widespread local suspicion, this is the first co-ordinated action of its kind by police, tax and immigration inspectors and Trading Standards officers. We were given exclusive access to dozens of raids carried out by Greater Manchester and West Mercia Police. Det Insp Melanie Johnson, who led the operation for Greater Manchester Police, said her own local High Street had 10 barbers and a mini-mart, which was \"not sustainable\". \"As a mum to young children, I want them to grow up feeling safe, in a community that isn't derelict, a High Street that isn't falling apart, and isn't populated by criminality,\" she said. During the operation: Police targeted a series of linked mini-marts in Rochdale that they suspect are \"fronts\" for illegal activity, staffed by Kurdish, Iraqi and Iranian asylum seekers. Officers later said some of the staff were working in the UK illegally A cannabis farm was found in Leigh and over 150 plants seized. Also found during raids across Greater Manchester were brown powder believed to be heroin, vials of testosterone, nitrous oxide, Xanax tranquilliser and a machete 35 people were arrested, and 55 suspected illegal immigrants were questioned. Three potential victims of modern slavery were identified Bank accounts and assets worth over Â£1m were later frozen and Â£40,000 in cash was seized The Shrewsbury raid was on a barber shop in the centre of town, one of five close together which were also targeted in the operation. \"Members of the public are angry. They can see these fronts are there,\" says Det Insp Fenn. \"The criminals feel they are hidden here. They think they can come to sleepy areas such as Shrewsbury and Telford and won't be found.\" It looks like the two men detained here have been living in the rooms above the barbers - there are clothes, shoes and food scattered on the floor as we move from room to room. The flats are barely furnished, with just a mattress and blankets on the floor. Det Insp Fenn says organised crime groups are different all over the country, but here he has been seeing familiar patterns of shops staffed with asylum seekers or illegal immigrants, many of the people in the barber shops being from Kurdish backgrounds. Some of the shops had hidden compartments The detective says that behind the front of a High Street business \"the main criminality may be modern-day slavery, exploitation and drugs\". Despite the barber shop's supposed high revenue, police find an unpaid Â£7,000 gas bill along with the seized cash and illicit vapes. Legitimate barbers say they want to see a registration scheme and a crackdown on unscrupulous operators. Gareth Penn, chief executive of the Hair and Barber Council, said the rise of illegal barbers has led to fungal infections, such as ringworm, from improperly cleaned equipment. \"This has a massive impact on legitimate businesses as they can't compete against those with few of the costs genuine barbers have,\" said Mr Penn. The NCA estimates that Â£12bn in illicit cash is laundered in the UK every year, some of it through criminal front organisations on the High Street. Their numbers appeared to surge as shop vacancies grew in the wake of the pandemic, creating an opening for criminal gangs.  Politicians began to demand action, prompting law enforcement, tax, immigration and Trading Standards agencies to develop this co-ordinated response. The NCA now has to analyse what Operation Machinize has uncovered for evidence of fraud and money laundering, to try to trace the networks behind these shops and stop the flow of criminal cash. Rachael Herbert, deputy director of economic crime at the NCA, said the presence of criminal front organisations \"gives the perception from the local community that criminals have the run of the High Street\" and contributes to the demise of shopping centres. \"Money laundering is not a victimless crime. It's associated with some of the most high-harm and violent crimes on the street,\" she said. Police seized cash in the raids along with drugs, illicit tobacco and vapes The NCA believes some barber shops or mini-marts are used as fronts for drug-trafficking, people-smuggling, modern slavery and child sexual exploitation. These kinds of shops have also been linked to the illicit importation of tobacco, vapes and firearms. In 2023, it secured the conviction of one Iranian Kurdish barber shop owner, Hewa Rahimpur, who was using his shop in London as a base for a far-reaching criminal organisation which smuggled 10,000 people to the UK in small boats. \"These businesses also evade an enormous amount of tax. That is money that doesn't go to the exchequer to be used for local communities,\" Ms Herbert said. Seeing illicit products like vapes, cigarettes and tobacco on sale is also a red flag to the investigating teams. In Rochdale, the sniffer dog shakes with excitement, her tail wagging frantically, above a hole concealing dozens of boxes of illegally imported tobacco products in one shop. \"We could hit this shop every day for a week and we'd still find stuff. It's non-stop,\" Dennis Chalmers from Trading Standards says. \"These shops are just set up to do this.\" Outside on the street, Mr Chalmers gestures to half a dozen shops on the street which he has visited and believes to be linked. \"They seem to be popping up everywhere. There's like five, six hairdressers in one row.\" Trading Standards officer Dennis Chalmers says he wants more powers to shut down shops He estimates across Rochdale there are more than 20 businesses that are fronts for criminal organisations and he says he sees many of the same people from Iran, Iraq and Kurdistan working in them. In one shop, a worker who says he is Kurdish claims he has only worked there for two days. \"Two days?\" asks Mr Chalmers. \"Even though I saw you here last week?\" The shop worker tells the Trading Standards officer he doers not know his boss's name. Mr Chalmers tells us: \"The danger is, because you don't know who is behind these businesses, as the employee doesn't know who the owner is, when we try and chase them they just keep changing, changing.\" Companies House documents show the shop address has been used to register four almost-identically named businesses since 2019, three of which faced action to strike them off the company register for failing to file accounts properly. Immigration officers say the Kurdish man in the shop has been in the country for four years, but has been granted the right to work while he waits for his asylum application to be decided. Close by, police and Trading Standards officers show us more mini-marts that have been left empty - they say staff disappeared as soon as police arrived. Outside one, a man approaches us laughing. It is clear he is not put off by the police action. He tells us he is from Iran and, when questioned, claims he does not work in the shop. We return later and see him inside the mini-mart, apparently working. \"We see him every day,\" says Mr Chalmers in frustration. \"It's just a game to them. A dangerous one.\" He says he would like more resources to get on top of the issue and greater powers to shut down these premises more quickly. Two people were detained in Shrewsbury, while 35 were arrested in the operation as a whole Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the operation \"highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face\". \"High Street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice,\" he said. But so far only 10 of the shops that were raided last month across England have been shut down. The majority of the shops we visited were back up and running within minutes of the police leaving. In Rochdale, we watched as Trading Standards officers identified a man they said was linked to the mini-marts walking from shop to shop with a backpack, which they believed contained illicit tobacco to restock the shelves. The challenge for authorities now is to stop the problem at its root and dismantle the suspected serious organised crime gangs - which may have been profiting in plain sight for years on our High Streets.

        "content": "A helicopter has crashed into the Hudson River, leaving six people dead, according to New York authorities The deceased include three children and three adults - the helicopter pilot and a family visiting from Spain Images from the scene show a helicopter floating upside down in the river which separates Manhattan from nearby New Jersey The New York Fire Department says both marine and land response units are attending the scene This video can not be played Watch: Rescue boats seen at site of helicopter crash in Hudson River Edited by Caitlin Wilson Sakshi VenkatramanBBC Live writer The crashed helicopter floats upside down in the Hudson River as first responders work around it. We've been following the news of a helicopter that crashed Thursday into the Hudson River, between New York City and New Jersey. Here is what we know about the incident:   We will be pausing our live coverage for now, but you can continue to stay up to date on the story here: Six dead after helicopter crashes in New York's Hudson River  The office of the mayor of Jersey City - across the Hudson River from New York City - says in a statement that the city's Office of Emergency Management is securing the submerged helicopter and will eventually remove it from the river.  It has also begun to investigate the crash in conjunction with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the statement says.  There were no victims or property damage in Jersey City, which is across the river from Lower Manhattan.  We have been looking at the helicopter's other flights earlier today before it crashed into the Hudson River, using the FlightAware tracking website.  The Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV helicopter, registered with the Federal Aviation Administration as N216MH, is shown to have made nine other short journeys from Lower Manhattan on Thursday, with most originating and terminating at the Downtown Manhattan Heliport, according to FlightAware. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a news conference that the aircraft belongs to a tour company called New York Helicopters. Most of the flights it was shown to have taken today were only minutes long, circling the island of Manhattan, heading towards the Statue of Liberty and then up to northern Manhattan near the George Washington Bridge before heading back to land at its take-off point.  The longest flight registered today lasted 25 minutes. Today's incident isn't the first time an aircrafts have gone down in the Hudson River.  The most famous incident, known as the \"Miracle on the Hudson\", happened in 2009 when a US Airways plane was struck by a flock of birds and forced to make an emergency landing on the river.  Captain Chelsey \"Sully\" Sullenberger became a household name after landing the plane successfully, with all of 155 passengers surviving. More recently, in 2019, a another helicopter crashed into the Hudson after refuelling. The pilot was the only person on board and only had minor injuries.  In 2016, a vintage plane flying over for an air show also went down in the river. The pilot was killed. Leaders in New Jersey â the state just across the Hudson\nRiver from New York City â have been posting their condolences online.  US Senator Cory Booker wrote: \"Heartbroken for the victims\nof the helicopter crash in the Hudson River... Iâm grateful for the swift\naction by emergency responders.\" And similar thoughts were posted by recently elected US Senator Andy Kim: \"Such awful news of a helicopter crash in the\nHudson... We are holding their loved ones close in our hearts today.\" Here is the location of the helicopter crash on the Hudson River, which has left six people dead, in New York.  During the news conference a few minutes ago, Jessica Tisch, the New York Police Commissioner, says that no names of the victims will be released until their families of the victims are\nnotified, Tisch says. Tisch also outlines the path of the fatal flight. The\nhelicopter was operated by the tour company New York Helicopters and took off\nat 14:59 local time (19:59 GMT). It flew up the Hudson River, then turned south\nbefore crashing near a pier in Hoboken, New Jersey â just across the Hudson\nfrom New York City.   The helicopter was upside-down when it hit the water, Tisch says. Mayor Eric Adams expressed his condolences for the six people who died in the crash, including the family of tourists from Spain and the pilot.  \"Our hearts go out to the family,\" he said. He also made a reference to the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson\", when a US Airways passenger plane landed on the same river and all 155 passengers survived.  \"It's almost reminiscent of the plane going down here on the Hudson river,\" he said.  \"Thank god we didn't lose any lives back then.\" He concluded by saying the investigation is ongoing.  \"We're praying for the families and our gratitude to the rescuers,\" he said. New York's Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker says that rescue boats were launched immediately after an emergency call was received. \"Swimmers were in the water shortly after the call,\" he says.  Tucker praised the efforts of fire and police responders working together, but notes it is a \"tragic day\". The investigation is ongoing, officials say, noting that 911 calls began coming in at approximatively 15:17 EDT (20:17 BST).  Once on the scene, officials started searching the water for victims or survivors. Immediate life-saving measures were attempted, they say, but were unsuccessful.  Four victims were pronounced dead on scene, the other two victims were pronounced dead at an area hospital, officials say.  Three adults and three children were on board, according to rescue authorities in New York.  The victims are a pilot and a family visiting from Spain.  All six were confirmed deceased.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has tweeted about the crash, calling it \"heartbreaking and tragic\". He goes on to say the fire and police departments in New York are assisting first responders in New Jersey who are also responding. He advised local residents to avoid the area.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says in a statement that the crashed helicopter is a Bell 206 - a type of two-bladed helicopter. The agency says it cannot confirm how many people were on board the flight, though as we've reported, our US partner CBS News says there were at least five people were on board.   The FAA says it will conduct an investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board, which will also provide further updates.  Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Spanish family among six dead in Hudson River helicopter crash",
        "content": "Six people, including three children, were killed after a helicopter carrying a family of tourists crashed into the Hudson River in New York, authorities have said.  The family of five was from Spain and the sixth person was the pilot, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters on Thursday. All were onboard the helicopter at the time of the crash, which is under investigation.  \"Our hearts go out to the families,\" Adams said. Authorities have yet to release the identities, but they have been widely named as AgustÃ­n Escobar and his wife MercÃ¨ CamprubÃ­ Montal, who were both executives at Siemens, and their children, aged four, five and 11. In a statement, a spokesperson for Siemens said: \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash that claimed the lives of Agustin Escobar and his family.  \"Our deepest condolences go out to all of his relatives.\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said the news was devastating and that he shared the grief of the victims' families.  The Spanish family lived in Barcelona, and regional leader Salvador Illa sent \"all my affection\" to their family and friends. A photograph of the family briefly published by the tour company shows them posing in front of the helicopter before the fatal incident. Video footage shows the helicopter falling out of the sky upside down before splashing into the Hudson River. Officials said the helicopter lost control soon after turning at the George Washington Bridge to move along the New Jersey shoreline.  The helicopter was operated by tour company New York Helicopters and took off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport on the lower side of the island at 14:59 local time (19:59 BST). What we know about the Hudson helicopter crash The first calls about the crash came around 15:17 EDT (20:17 BST) and rescue boats were launched immediately, New York Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said. \"Swimmers were in the water shortly after the call,\" he said. This video can not be played Watch: 'The helicopter just fell' - Hudson River crash leaves six dead Once on the scene, rescuers searched the water for victims or survivors and initiated \"immediate life-saving measures\", but the efforts were unsuccessful. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others were declared dead at a nearby hospital, officials said.  The part of the river where the helicopter crashed is near Manhattan's west side, an area known for its trendy shops and dining. It's also near the main campus of New York University. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the investigation into the crash of the Bell 206 - a two-bladed helicopter - will be led by the National Transportation Safety Board. The Bell 206 is commonly used by sightseeing companies, television news stations and police departments.  US President Donald Trump said the crash was terrible and more details would soon be released about what happened. \"God bless the families and friends of the victims,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. Rescue boats were launched shortly after the first calls about the crash, which occurred roughly 18 minutes after the helicopter took off Michael Roth, chief executive of New York Helicopter Charter Inc, told CNN he was \"devastated\". \"I'm a father, a grandfather, and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon,\" he said. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Mr Roth replied: \"It's my director of maintenance who deals with that.\" Eyewitnesses who saw the crash told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, that they saw parts of the helicopter fall from the sky.  \"I looked outside my window. I saw a few people running towards the water, and some people were acting pretty normal. So I was like oh, it might not be anything. Then I started to hear all the sirens come outside,\" Jersey City resident Jenn Lynk said. Another, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, told CBS the crash sounded like thunder.  \"I saw, like, black particles flying,\" she said. \"Again, I thought maybe it's just like, dust, or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by, and I think that's when it was like, OK, what's happening.\" This is not the first deadly tourist helicopter crash in New York City. In 2018, another tourist helicopter crashed into the East River. All five passengers drowned with only the pilot surviving.  In 2009, a helicopter carrying Italian tourists collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine.  Nearly 30,000 tourist trips take off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport every year, according to the New York Comptroller's Office.

        "content": "Barack and Michelle Obama have faced divorce rumours for months Michelle Obama has spoken out against rumours that her marriage to Barack Obama might be in trouble.  The former first lady has not accompanied her husband to several high-profile events â including Donald Trump's inauguration and the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter â fuelling speculation that they might be separating.    Without explicitly mentioning these occasions, Mrs Obama told the Work in Progress podcast hosted by actress Sophia Bush that she was now in a position to control her own calendar as a \"grown woman\". She said that people were not able to believe that she was \"making a decision\" for herself and instead \"had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing\". Mrs Obama shared that she felt some guilt for stepping back from certain duties. \"That's the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,\" she said. \"I mean, so much so that this year people couldn't even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing. \"This couldn't be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that's what society does to us.\" Mrs Obama also said in the podcast: \"I chose to do what was best for me. Not what I had to do. Not what I thought other people wanted me to do.\" While her absence from President Trump's inauguration was seen as a break from tradition, she did give a high-profile speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this past summer. \"Hope is making a comeback,\" she told a Chicago crowd of thousands at the DNC, as she urged them to throw their weight behind then-presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

Mrs Obama has previously been open about the struggles she faced in her marriage due to Mr Obama's political ambitions and time in the White House in her best-selling memoir, Becoming.

        "title": "Unsecured penguin caused helicopter crash in South Africa",
        "content": "Shortly after take-off, the box containing the penguin knocked the controls causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft An \"unsecured\" penguin in a cardboard box was the cause of a helicopter crash in South Africa, a report into the incident has found. The penguin, which had been placed in the box and on the lap of a passenger, slid off and knocked the pilot's controls just after take-off from Bird Island off the Eastern Cape on 19 January. The South African Civil Aviation Authority said the impact sent the helicopter crashing to the ground. No-one on board, including the penguin, was hurt.  The authority said that \"the lack of secure containment for the penguin\" was responsible for creating the \"dangerous situation\". According to the report, released this week, the flight had been conducting an aerial survey of the island in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape province. After completing the survey, the helicopter landed, where a specialist then requested the transport of one penguin back to Port Elizabeth. The report did not say why they had picked up the penguin. The aviation authority said the pilot conducted a \"risk assessment\" but omitted to include the transport of the penguin on board which \"was not in accordance with the Civil Aviation Regulations (CAR) 2011\". When the helicopter was about 15m (50 feet) above ground, the cardboard box slid off the lap of the specialist to the right and caused the cyclic pitch control lever to move to the far-right position causing the aircraft roll, the report determined. Unable to recover, the main rotor blades then struck the ground and the helicopter ultimately crashed on its starboard side approximately 20m from the point of lift-off. While the helicopter sustained substantial damage, both the pilot and passengers were uninjured and the penguin was unharmed. The report said all situations should be subject to \"established safety protocols\" and compliance with aviation safety procedures.  It also said that a proper evaluation of the situation and potential hazards (such as cargo shifting) should have been conducted. \"The absence of a proper, secured crate meant that the penguin's containment was not suitable for the flight conditions,\" it said.

        "title": "Gaza medics killing: Israeli army fired as close as 12m, audio suggests",
        "content": "This video can not be played Gaza medics killing video analysed by BBC Verify Israeli troops fired more than 100 times during an attack in which they killed 15 emergency workers in Gaza, with some shots from as close as 12m (39ft) away, a forensic audio analysis of mobile phone footage commissioned by BBC Verify has found. Two audio experts examined a 19-minute video authenticated by BBC Verify, showing the incident and the moments leading up to it near Rafah on 23 March. The findings support a claim made by the Palestinian Red Crescent that the workers were \"targeted from a very close range\". On 5 April an Israeli army official said aerial footage showed troops opening fire \"from afar\". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) declined to comment on the analysis directly when approached by BBC Verify. A spokesperson said it was investigating the attack and repeated claims that six of the people killed were linked to Hamas, without offering evidence. The Palestinian Red Crescent rejected the allegation, as did a ninth paramedic who survived and was detained by the IDF for 15 hours. The Palestinian Red Crescent said the full video was recovered from the phone of a medic killed and buried in a shallow grave by the IDF.  Video filmed by medic Rifaat Radwan who was killed in the incident showed the convoy driving at night, using headlights and flashing emergency lights. At least one medic can be seen wearing a high-vis jacket. Faced with this, the Israeli army changed its account, admitting that its initial statement that the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" with its lights off was inaccurate. Experts told BBC Verify they used sound waveforms and spectrograms to measure the distance of the gunfire from the microphone of the mobile. Shortened time gaps indicate that the distance between the microphone and the gunfire decreased as the video progressed. They concluded that the first shots were fired from around 40m to 43m away. But towards the end of the video, gunfire came from around 12m away. At a briefing on 5 April, an IDF official told reporters that surveillance showed the troops were at some distance when they opened fire, adding: \"It's not from close. They opened fire from afar.\" One military expert told BBC Verify that any engagements under 50m to 100m would be considered as being within close range. Robert Maher, an audio forensics expert at Montana State University, said towards the start of the footage one firearm is discharged about 43m away from the mobile phone. Mr Maher and another expert, Steven Beck, independently corroborated one another's view that in the final few moments of the audio, shots are fired as close at 12m away. Mr  Beck, a former FBI consultant who now runs Beck Audio Forensics, said: \"The shooter(s) at these times is much closer, with distances of 12m to 18m.  There is a strange pop sound that may be a tire hit by a bullet.\" He added: \"The shockwaves indicate that the bullets are passing close to the recorder microphone - meaning they are being shot at.\" Chris Cobb-Smith, a former British Army officer with over 20 years experience in conducting investigations in conflicts zones, said that at 50m the Israeli troops would have \"definitively been able to identify the convoy as humanitarian\" and would have been able to \"determine that the personnel were unarmed and not posing a threat\". Israel changes account of Gaza medic killings after video showed deadly attack Survivor challenges Israeli account of attack on Gaza paramedics Voices can also be heard towards the end of the recording, shouting in Hebrew: \"Get up,\" and: \"You (plural) go back\". Over the period of more than five minutes, at times, multiple firearms were in use simultaneously, the audio experts determined. Mr Maher said \"the sounds are often overlapping in such a way that it is clear multiple firearms are in use at the same time\". Because of the overlap of gunshots, Mr Maher said it's difficult to identify individual shots. But both experts determined independently that there were more than 100 shots. Our audio analysts could not comment on which weapons were being used but Mr Beck said there are \"several bursts of fully automatic gunfire\". A bullet travelling at supersonic speed first creates a sonic boom - often called a \"crack\". The sound of the bullet being fired is what creates a second sound, often called a \"pop\".  At close distances, the two sounds are almost indiscernible to the human ear. But by looking closely at the waveform of the audio, the two sounds can be detected and the distance between them measured. What Mr Maher describes as \"crack-pop sequences\" are visible in these waveforms. Mr Maher said the further away the firearm is from the microphone, the longer the gap between the two sounds. Mr Maher said: \"The first few audible gunshots have a crack-pop timing of about 72ms.  Assuming a bullet speed of 800 m/s and speed of sound 343 m/s, that time gap implies the firearm was about 43 meters away.  If the bullet speed were actually faster, that would move the firearm estimate closer to the microphone.\" There are limitations to their estimates. For example, analysts told us they cannot be certain of the type of firearm used or of the miss distance, which is how far off the shot is from the intended target. They also must make an assumption about the average speed of the bullet.  BBC Verify will continue to investigate this incident. Additional reporting by Thomas Spencer.

        "content": "Prada has agreed to buy its smaller rival Versace in a billion dollar deal to unite two of the biggest designer fashion labels. The deal to unite the two Italian brands has an estimated value of $1.36bn (Â£1.06bn), the Prada Group said on Thursday. \"We aim to continue Versace's legacy celebrating and re-interpreting its bold and timeless aesthetic,\" said Prada chairman Patrizio Bertelli. The Prada Group already owns several other designer labels including Miu Miu and luxury footwear brand Church's. Its acquisition of Versace will create a multi-billion dollar luxury fashion group, putting the brands in a position to compete with the likes of French luxury fashion conglomerates LVMH and Kering. Negotiations to buy Versace between Prada and Capri began in February. The price Prada agreed to pay for Versace is significantly lower than the $2.15bn that Capri Holdings spent when it bought Versace in 2018. The deal, which includes the brand's debt pile, comes as Versace has been operating at a loss amid a slowdown in demand for luxury fashion worldwide.  Capri also owns other fashions brands including Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors. Mr Bertelli said that the Prada Group would provide Versace with \"a strong platform\". \"Versace has huge potential. The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience,\" added Andrea Guerra, the chief executive of Prada. In March, Donatella Versace stepped down from her creative director role at the luxury brand after nearly 30 years. She had held the position since 1997 and took over after the murder of her brother Gianni. The 69-year-old has a new role as the chief brand ambassador for Versace, while Dario Vitale, who is a former design and image director of Miu Miu, took over as chief creative officer.

        "title": "Health board call to restrict access to nurse trans row tribunal",
        "content": "Dr Beth Upton has given evidence at the tribunal brought by Sandy Peggie A health board is seeking to bar the public from online viewing of future hearings in an employment tribunal about a transgender doctor using a female changing room. NHS Fife has requested only media be allowed to watch the livestream of the case brought by nurse Sandie Peggie against the health board when it resumes in July. It said technical issues and \"interruptions caused by non-media observers\" caused \"significant delays\" to proceedings at earlier hearings in Dundee. Ms Peggie was suspended from her work at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on 3 January 2024 after she complained about having to share a changing room with transgender medic Dr Beth Upton. Dr Upton made an allegation of bullying and harassment. The tribunal hearings in February could initially be viewed virtually by members of the public, however the judge later restricted virtual access to accredited media.

        "title": "Butere Girls School' Echoes of War: Kenya police fire tear gas during Cleophas Malala's play",
        "content": "The play, pictured during a previous performance, mirrors some of Kenya's pressing problems Kenya's national high-school drama competition has been overshadowed by drama of its own after police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered to watch a controversial play. Echoes of War is set in a fictional kingdom where the youth have lost faith in their leaders.  It features battles with the police and has drawn parallels with last year's protests by young people against tax rises. It was initially disqualified from the drama festival under unclear circumstances, but a High Court ruling overturned the decision and ordered it to be included. Tensions flared in the western town of Nakuru on Thursday morning when the student performers stormed out of the venue, demanding the release of the play's author, Cleophas Malala, who had been detained by police. The scriptwriter and former senator who had penned the production for students from Butere Girls High School, was blocked by police from meeting the young performers for final rehearsals on Wednesday evening. Malala was later released without charge and praised the students for boycotting the play.  \"The young girls of Butere Girls' have exercised an act of heroic restoration. I'm determined to ensure that Echoes of War is displayed before a Kenyan audience,\" Malala said immediately after his release.  New faces of protest - Kenya's Gen Z anti-tax revolutionaries Kenyan president's humbling shows power of African youth The students briefly sang the national anthem before dramatically leaving the hall, which was sealed off by anti-riot police, armed with batons and tear gas canisters.  \"There's no audience. Who are we performing for?\" one of the girls told journalists.  They also complained about police harassment.  Following news of Malala's arrest, large crowds had gathered outside the venue curious to watch the play. But anti-riot police had been deployed overnight in case of trouble and they fired tear gas to disperse the would-be audience. Education Minister Julius Ogamba questioned the involvement of Malala in the competition, saying the politician was neither a teacher nor a play director.   \"I wonder why a politician should be a script writer for a student performance. Even the competition loses value if we do not allow the teachers to be scriptwriters,\" Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said, warning politicians against using innocent students to settle their political scores. \"Let us have a thick line between politics and education,\" he added.   The row has sparked public uproar, with rights group Amnesty International saying it was \"pointing to a worrying pattern of state-sponsored repression, external of free expression, press freedom, and the right to associate\". Chief Justice Martha Koome said that Malala's detention contravened the court order that the play, and its author, be allowed to take part in the competition. \"Defiance of court orders not only undermines the authority of the courts but also poses a serious threat to the rule of law, which is the bedrock of our society,\" she added. Prominent opposition figure Kalonzo Musyoka condemned the police for firing tear gas near students, praising the \"brave\" girls for declining to perform.  In a statement, the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) demanded that the students be allowed to stage their play like all the other competitors.  The fictitious kingdom in Echoes of War play is ruled by a tyrannical sultan who is irked by the activism of the youth, portraying similarities to what is currently happening in Kenya, where young people have been demanding better governance.  It is not clear whether the play will now be disqualified and so not get through to the finals, which are held at State House with the president in attendance.   The annual high school drama competitions are hugely popular in Kenya, with students often using theatre as a tool to challenge those in power.  This is not the first time one of the plays has angered the authorities.  In 2013, Malala made headlines with his controversial play Shackles of Doom, which thrust him into the national limelight - and eventually into politics. The play, also performed by Butere Girls' High School, was banned by the government before the High Court ruled against the ban and allowed the play to be staged. At the time, Malala said Shackles of Doom depicted Kenya's highly ethnised politics which he said contributed to the unequal distribution of resources in the country.  The senator, who has written dozens of other plays, was last August kicked out of the ruling United Democratic Alliance (UDA) following internal party wrangles. He has since fallen out with President William Ruto, whom he campaigned for during the 2022 general elections.

        "content": "A woman in Australia has unknowingly given birth to a stranger's baby, after her fertility clinic accidentally implanted another woman's embryos into her. The mix-up at Monash IVF in Brisbane, Queensland has been blamed on human error, Australian media reports. \"On behalf of Monash IVF, I want to say how truly sorry I am for what has happened,\" CEO Michael Knaap said, adding that everyone at the fertility clinic was \"devastated\" at the mistake. Last year, the same clinic paid a A$56m (Â£26.8m) settlement to hundreds of patients whose embryos were destroyed despite them being viable. According to a spokesperson for Monash IVF, staff became aware of the problem in February when the birth parents asked to transfer their remaining frozen embryos to another clinic. Monash has confirmed that an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the wrong person, resulting in the birth of a child. The clinic has launched an investigation and Mr Knaap said the clinic was confident it was an isolated incident. Monash said that when the incident was discovered it activated its crisis management team and within a week the Brisbane clinic  started meeting affected patients to apologise and offer them support. The company has also reported the incident to relevant regulators, including the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee, and voluntarily reported it to the new Queensland assisted reproductive technology regulator. Last year, Monash IVF reached a A$56m (Â£26.8m) settlement in a landmark class action, external with 700 former patients for destroying embryos after inaccurate genetic testing. The case found that about 35% of the embryos, which were actually normal and could have resulted in a viable pregnancy, were found to be abnormal by the faulty screening. Monash made no admission of liability as part of the settlement. IVF - or in vitro fertilisation - involves the removal of eggs from a woman's ovaries, which are then fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. When the fertilised eggs become embryos, they are inserted into the woman's uterus. It is an expensive process and not successful every time. In 2021 there were 20,690 babies born as a result of IVF in Australia and New Zealand, according to a report by the University of New South Wales, external.

        "title": "Donald Trump signs order to 'make America's showers great again'",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: \"I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair\" Donald Trump is going to \"make America's showers great again\" by easing rules restricting water flow, the White House says. The US president is ordering the energy secretary to rescind a change introduced by Barack Obama that restricted multi-nozzle showers from discharging over 2.5 gallons of water per minute overall. This served \"a radical green agenda that made life worse for Americans\", the White House said, as Trump criticised the \"ridiculous\" amount of time he says it takes to wet his hair in the shower. Consumer and conservation groups have previously argued that changing the rules is wasteful and unnecessary. The hidden impact of your daily water use According to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which shared a factsheet  in 2024, efficiency standards in the US set more than three decades ago \"reduce water waste... save consumers money on their water and energy bills and help protect the environment\". Under a 1992 energy law, showerheads in the US are not allowed to produce more than 2.5 gallons (9.5l) of water per minute. Obama introduced a redefinition, as part of an Energy Conservation Program, that meant for showers with multiple nozzles, the restriction applied overall rather than to each nozzle. At the end of Trump's first term, in 2020, he moved to allow each nozzle to produce up to 2.5 gallons a minute. But when Joe Biden succeeded him as president, he stopped that. The current administration has dubbed their efforts a \"war on water pressure\", saying Americans \"pay for their own water and should be free to choose their showerheads without federal meddling\". Trump now wants to return to the \"straightforward meaning\" of 'showerhead' from the 1992 law. According to the White House fact sheet: \"The Order frees Americans from excessive regulations that turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare. \"No longer will showerheads be weak and worthless.\" The order says the change will come into effect 30 days after the energy secretary publishes a notice rescinding the definition. While signing the order in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said it was \"ridiculous\" he has to stand under the water for 15 minutes for his \"beautiful\" hair to get wet - echoing remarks he made during 2020. At that time, he also complained about water not coming out of shower heads, saying his hair \"has to be perfect\".

        "title": "Barclays cuts rates on some mortgages to below 4%",
        "content": "Barclays has become the biggest UK lender so far to cut mortgage rates as the continued uncertainty caused by US tariff policy raises expectations of interest rate cuts this year. Barclays is reducing the rate on certain fixed-term deals to 3.99%, joining several other lenders who have cut mortgage rates this week. US President Donald Trump has brought in import taxes on dozens of countries since re-entering the White House, although on Wednesday he paused the higher rate on some of them. But concerns that tariffs may cause an economic slowdown has led to many analysts predicting the Bank of England will reduce borrowing costs by more than expected this year in order to boost growth. Barclays is cutting rates on several of its products, including its two-year and five-year fixed deals, from Friday.  However, these fixed rates of below 4% are only available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value and an Â£899 fee applies. Coventry Building Society, TSB, the Co-operative Bank and Bank of Ireland are among those to have cut rates this week. According to the financial data company Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate ticked down on Thursday from 5.3% to 5.29%. The average five-year fix dipped from 5.15% to 5.14%. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? How exposed is the UK to Trump's tariff chaos? How Trump's tariffs might affect you and your money The Bank of England's main interest rate currently stands at 4.5%. Up until the last few days, most analysts had been expecting the central bank to cut that twice this year. But after Trump announced bigger-than-expected tariffs on a number of countries, financial markets now predict four cuts. So-called swap rates, which influence the price of fixed-rate mortgage deals, have been falling in recent days. However, they bounced back slightly on Thursday following the pause on some of the steepest tariffs. Andrew Montlake, chief executive of Coreco mortgage brokers, said it showed how volatile markets are at present. While he would like to see more lenders offer cheaper deals, \"lenders may well prefer to adopt more of a wait and see approach,\" he said. \"Rate cuts are on the cards, with the Bank of England expected to cut further in May, but mortgage rates may not fall quite as much as some are predicting.  \"Trying to play the market in this environment is fraught with danger,\" he added. Hannah Bashford, mortgage and protection adviser at Model Financial Solutions, said that while Barclays' cuts were \"a very positive step\" for borrowers, the sub-4% rates it was offering were for purchases and not for people looking to re-mortgage. \"This is a signal that the lenders are still trying to keep the housing market alive but are keeping re-mortgage customers out in the cold,\" she said.

        "title": "Australia declines China's offer to 'join hands' on Trump tariffs",
        "content": "Australia wants to focus on its national interests in the face of Trump tariffs. Australia has swiftly turned down China's offer to \"join hands\" against Donald Trump's tariffs, as Washington escalates its trade war with Beijing. The White House recently imposed an import tax of 10% on Australian goods, but for China - Australia's biggest trading partner - raised tariffs to 125%. China's ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian argued joint resistance is \"the only way\" to stop the \"hegemonic and bullying behaviour of the US\",  appealing for Canberra's cooperation in an opinion piece on Thursday. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, said Australians would \"speak for ourselves\", while the country's defence minister said the nation would not be \"holding China's hand\". \"It's about pursuing Australia's national interests, not about making common calls with China,\" Richard Marles told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Hours earlier, Trump had dramatically changed course on his sweeping tariffs scheme, announcing a 90-day pause for countries hit with high US tariffs. In the meantime, a tariff of 10% would apply. China was the exception though. Instead, the US imposed an extra bump on import fees, after Beijing announced it would impose 84% counter-tariffs on the US. Canberra has expressed anger over the tariffs but has said it will not retaliate, instead seeking further negotiations with the White House. In his opinion piece for Nine Newspapers, Mr Xiao said the US had \"weaponised\" trade issues and expressed concern that a \"weak compromise\" would enable Trump to \"sabotage the international order\" and drag the world economy into a \"quagmire\" and an \"abyss\". Australia and China have a \"mutually beneficial and long-standing co-operation\" and need to work together to \"safeguard a fair and free trading environment\", he added. \"The international community... should firmly say no to unilateralism and protectionism.\" Albanese told reporters on Thursday that Australia's trade relationship with China was an important one, but said Australia was focussed on looking for other export opportunities outside of the US. \"Eighty percent of trade does not involve the United States. There are opportunities for Australia and we intend to seize them,\" he said. Marles said Australia is also looking to lessen its reliance on China, to bolster \"economic resilience\", adding that the country's focus would be on diversifying trade, in particular with Indonesia, India, the UK and the UAE.

        "title": "Zimbabwe's white farmers to receive first compensation payments over land invasions",
        "content": "The payments are the first under a 2020 deal between the state and the former farm owners Zimbabwe's government has announced an initial pay-out of US$3m (Â£2.3m) to white farmers whose farms were seized under a controversial government programme more than two decades ago. It is the first payment to be made under the 2020 compensation agreement signed between the state and the local white farmers in which Zimbabwe committed to pay $3.5bn (Â£2.6bn) for seized farmland.  Thousands of white farmers were forced from their land, often violently, between 2000 and 2001. The seizures were meant to redress colonial-era land grabs but contributed to the country's economic decline and ruined relations with the West. The payment announced on Wednesday willÂ cover the first 378 farms, out of a total of 740, for which compensation had been approved.  It represents 1% of the total $311m allocated for the first batch of payments. The remainder will be paid through US-dollar denominated Treasury bonds, said Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube. \"One of our commitments as we try to reform the Zimbabwe economy, to clear our arrears, is really to compensate the former farm owners who lost their farms during the land reform programme,\" he said. \"We have now begun to honour that agreement.\"  A man called Bombshell fires up Zimbabwe's succession battle Harry Orphanides, one of the farmers' representatives, told the BBC that more farmers have now indicated an interest in signing up for the compensation.  However, the majority of former farmers have not signed up to the deal, and are still holding onto their title deeds. The government has only agreed to compensate former farm owners for \"improvements\" made on the land and refused to pay for the land itself, arguing it was unfairly seized by colonialists. It had prioritised foreign-owned farms under separate negotiations. In January, Zimbabwe began paying compensation for foreign investors whose farms were protected under bilateral investment agreements. In 1980, Zimbabwe gained independence, ending decades of white-minority rule. At that time, most of the country's most fertile land was owned by some 4,000 white farmers. Land reform was focused on redistributing white-owned land to black farmers, following colonial-era policies when thousands of black farmers were forced from their land and the country's most fertile areas were reserved for white people. In 2000, then President Robert Mugabe supported land invasions by a mix of government forces and vigilante groups, sparking international condemnation. President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe in a 2017 coup, has sought to engage Western governments to restore ties. Mnangagwa has previously said land reform cannot be reversed, but committed to paying compensation as a key way of mending ties with the West. The southern African country has been locked out of the global financial system for more than two decades, leaving the struggling economy with a huge foreign debt. Analysts say the land payment marks an important step in repairing relations with Western nations and avoiding international judgements against Zimbabwe.

        "content": " A discussion of the life and legacy of Cyrus the Great, who is said to have destroyed Babylon and enabled the Jews to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem - a contested story. Melvyn Bragg and guests explore the history and reputation of the Persian ruler Cyrus the Great. Cyrus the Second of Persia as he was known then was born in the sixth century BCE in Persis which is now in Iran. He was the founder of the first Persian Empire, the largest empire at that point in history, spanning more than two million square miles.  His story was told by the Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon, and in the Hebrew bible he is praised for freeing the Jewish captives in Babylon.  But the historical facts are intertwined with fiction. Cyrus proclaimed himself ‘king of the four corners of the world’ in the famous Cyrus Cylinder, one of the most admired objects in the British Museum. It’s been called by some the first bill of human rights, but that’s a label which has been disputed by most scholars today.

        "title": "Ukraine war: Zelensky claims 155 Chinese fighting for Russia",
        "content": "The two captured Chinese citizen's passports were displayed in the video shared by Zelensky Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says at least 155 Chinese citizens are fighting for Russia in the war. His comments come after two Chinese fighters were captured earlier this week - marking Kyiv's first official allegation that China was supplying Russia with manpower. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Zelensky reiterated his claim that there are \"many more\" Chinese nationals engaged in the conflict, based on information gathered by his government. Responding on Thursday, a Chinese government spokesman said they \"advise relevant parties to correctly and soberly understand China's role and not to make irresponsible remarks\". The two captured Chinese citizens were also seen speaking in the video shared by Zelensky \"China is neither the creator nor a party to the Ukrainian crisis. We are a staunch supporter and active promoter of the peaceful resolution of the crisis,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian. He reiterated an earlier comment that appeared to suggest that Chinese soldiers fighting for Russia were doing so in their private capacity. Mr Lin said China \"has always required its citizens to stay away from armed conflict areas and avoid being involved in armed conflicts in any form, especially to avoid participating in military operations of any party\". Beijing has previously denied many of its citizens are fighting for Russia, saying the claim has \"no basis in facts\".  Ukraine captures two Chinese nationals fighting for Russia War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again Earlier this week, Zelensky said his forces had fought six Chinese soldiers in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region and took two prisoner. Russia declined to comment on this revelation.  On Wednesday Zelensky had told reporters that the \"the Chinese issue is serious.\" \"There are 155 people with surnames, with passport data - 155 Chinese citizens who are fighting against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraine,\" he said, according to remarks reported by Interfax., external He added that Russia was recruiting Chinese citizens on social media, and that \"official Beijing knows about this\". According to Zelensky, the alleged recruits receive training in Moscow before being sent out to the battlefield in Ukraine, as well as migration documents and payment. He also released on X a video of what appeared to be an interrogation of the two captured Chinese soldiers. Speaking in Mandarin Chinese, the soldiers described their background and how they were captured.  One of them said it was his \"first time on duty and first time in combat. Before this I had never even fired a gun\". He added that he was captured with a Russian soldier. The other mentions he was in a group that included two other Chinese soldiers before they were separated in the chaos. \"Everyone dispersed, I don't know if they're dead or not,\" he said.  He said he eventually surrendered along with Russian soldiers. Zelensky said on X that: \"Ukraine believes that such blatant involvement of Chinese citizens in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine during the war of aggression is a deliberate step towards the expansion of the war, and is yet another indication that Moscow simply needs to drag out the fighting.\" He has called on the US and the rest of the world for a response. Washington has said the reports of Chinese fighting for Russia are \"disturbing\". Ukraine has in the past questioned China's declared neutral stance. Zelensky previously alleged that Beijing supplies \"elements that are part of Russia's weaponry\" and called for the country to maintain a \"consistent\" position. China has been accused by the US of helping Russia make more munitions, armoured vehicles and missiles. It has also been scrutinised for allowing dual-use technology that can be used both commercially and militarily - such as computer chips and drones - to be exported to Russia. While Beijing and Moscow are close political and economic allies, China has attempted to present itself as a neutral party in the conflict and has repeatedly denied supplying Russia with military equipment. It defends its trade with Moscow by saying it is not selling lethal arms and \"prudently handles the export of dual-use items in accordance with laws and regulations\". The allegations about Chinese soldiers fighting for Russia follows Ukraine's capture of two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk Oblast.

        "title": "Andrew Tate allegations detailed in UK civil claim documents",
        "content": "Andrew Tate speaking to reporters in Bucharest after returning from a trip to the US last month Andrew Tate pointed a gun in a woman's face and said \"you're going to do as I say or there'll be hell to pay\", according to one of four UK women suing the influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist. The allegation is described in court documents, seen by the BBC, which also contain detailed accounts of rape, assault and coercive control. One woman claims Tate threatened to kill her, another says he made clear he would kill anyone who spoke to her, and a third claims Tate convinced her he had killed other people. Tate has denied the claims in a written defence submitted to the High Court, calling them a \"pack of lies\" and \"gross fabrications\". Separately, Tate continues to face serious legal challenges in three countries - a mixture of civil and criminal claims in the UK, US and Romania. This civil case concerns incidents the four women allege took place in Luton and Hitchin between 2013 and 2015. Two of the women worked for Tate's webcam business in 2015, while the other two were in relationships with him in 2013 and 2014. The BBC has previously spoken to two of the claimants about their alleged experiences with Tate as part of a Panorama documentary broadcast in September 2024. However, this is the first time the full extent of the women's allegations has been revealed. Warning: This article contains strong language and distressing details of alleged violence and sexual assault Some of the allegations in the documents seen by the BBC include that Tate: Raped and strangled a woman who was working for his webcam business in 2015 Assaulted another woman who was also working for his webcam business at the same time Strangled both of the above women so often that they developed red petechiae - spots from burst capillaries - in their eyes, a common side effect of asphyxia Told a third claimant \"I'm just debating whether to rape you or not\" before raping and strangling her Strangled a fourth claimant, whom we are calling Sienna, during sex until she lost consciousness, and then continued to have sex with her Three of the women previously reported Tate to the police but in 2019, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to bring criminal charges. They are now seeking damages \"arising from the assaults, batteries, and infliction of intentional harm\", their civil claim states. Tate denies all the allegations, and argues that the women cannot now take legal action against him because too much time has passed, and emails, texts, and other potential evidence would have been lost. A preliminary hearing for the case is due to take place on 15 April. \"Sienna\", the fourth woman involved in the civil case, was not part of the group that reported Tate to the police. She told the BBC that when she slept with Tate, the sex was initially consensual. \"But then, during sex, he started to strangle me. I passed out, and he carried on having sex with me,\" she said. Tate denies strangling Sienna, and that she lost consciousness due to strangulation, adding that he \"may have put a hand on her neck but there was no restriction of her breathing\". This video can not be played Watch: 'He held me against the wall by my neck' In her claim submitted to the court, Sienna also describes an alleged incident at Tate's flat in late 2014, where she saw a gun on his sofa. She says she \"did not know if it was real or a replica\". In his written defence, Tate says \"there may have been a toy gun in the flat but the 4th Claimant [Sienna] never said anything about it\". \"I didn't really mention it to him or anything,\" Sienna told the BBC. \"But I distinctly remember it being there and kind of being a bit freaked out by it, because it's not really something you see in the UK.\" She added that she thought it would be \"a bit strange for a fully grown man to have a toy gun\". Andrew Tate: The self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate challenged on misogyny in combative BBC interview âTate raped and strangled usâ - women talk to BBC In the court documents another claimant, referred to as AA, alleges Tate threatened her with a gun in her face while swearing, calling himself \"a boss\" and a \"G\" and adding: \"You're going to do as I say or there'll be hell to pay.\" Tate denies this happened, writing in his defence that he only started calling himself \"Top G\" in recent years. AA says Tate \"threatened [her] daily\" while she was working for him in 2015, and describes two alleged incidents in which he \"grabbed her by her throat and pinned her up against the wall, so she was unable to move\". Tate also denies AA's claims that he threatened her and grabbed her by the neck. Another claimant, BB, alleges Tate \"made it very clear that she was 'his', and if anyone else spoke to her, he would kill them\". BB's written claim describes her being \"forced to barricade herself inside the bathroom while the Defendant [Tate] threatened to 'beat the shit out of' her\". Tate denies this allegation, and describes his relationship with BB as \"loving and affectionate until shortly before she ceased to work for the business\". In a statement, his solicitor Andrew Ford said the women's allegations, including the claims of Tate having a gun, \"are vehemently denied and will be fully contested in court\". \"No firearm was recovered during police searches,\" Mr Ford said. \"When the matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, they concluded there was insufficient prospect of conviction and chose not to charge Mr Tate with any offence.\" Details of help and support with sexual abuse and violence are available in the UK at BBC Action Line All four women say they have developed long-term mental health problems as a result of their alleged experiences with Tate. Lawyer Matt Jury of McCue Jury & Partners, who is representing the women, told the BBC his clients had \"been denied justice by the police and CPS, while watching Andrew Tate's influence grow\". \"They have been left with no other choice but to bring their case in the High Court to finally bring Tate to account,\" he said. The women's claim against Tate is one of several serious legal challenges around the world that he is fighting, including some where he is co-accused with his brother Tristan Tate. They are currently facing a mix of criminal and civil legal action in three countries - the UK, the US and Romania. In Romania, they are facing allegations including human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering. Andrew Tate also faces allegations of rape. They are also under criminal investigation in the US state of Florida. Andrew Tate has said that US authorities are \"trying to find crimes on an innocent man\". Andrew Tate's ex-girlfriend Brianna Stern also filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles last month, accusing him of sexual assault, battery and gender violence. Last year, the brothers were detained in Bucharest after Bedfordshire Police in the UK said it had obtained an arrest warrant in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating back to between 2012 and 2015. The pair deny all accusations against them. A travel ban imposed on the brothers in Romania was recently lifted, and they have since travelled to the US and Dubai - something Sienna said was \"horrible to see\". \"Maybe men will look at him and think, 'oh well if he can get away with that, then so can I' - and it kind of makes it normalised,\" she told the BBC. Sienna added that she thought the UK should be \"pushing a lot harder\" for the extradition of the Tate brothers. Neither of the brothers have been convicted of any crimes.

        "title": "James Bond and Paddington could star at Universal UK",
        "content": "A source has told the BBC that a James Bond stunt show will be part of the new Universal park  A source close to the Universal UK project has told the BBC what fans can expect from the new park being built in Bedford. James Bond, Paddington and Lord of the Rings are among the brands set to appear at the park, the BBC has learned. Rides and attractions related to Harry Potter are not expected to be included. On its website, Universal Destinations has claimed \"it is too early\" to know what attractions will be at the park. Construction on the site at Kempston Hardwick, Bedfordshire, is expected to start next year if planning permission is granted. While the source is confident that these concepts are happening, the theme park is not expected to open until 2031, which means some plans could change. Buildings reminiscent of Jurassic Park can be seen in the concept art shared by Universal Universal aims to provide distinct attractions at each of its parks, with the Bedfordshire one set to feature unique attractions not found elsewhere. The BBC has been told that other themed zones and rides at the park will be inspired by Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and Minions. The source insisted \"contracts have been signed\" and it would be unlikely things would change. \"At this point it will be little details they tweak, like 'Let's use a different shade of paint on that Lord of the Rings castle',\" they said. The locations can be seen on the map of what the site could look like, although specific details, such as the Hill Valley clock from Back to the Future, have been obscured. Rides have already been designed, with the majority planned as indoor attractions. Rollercoasters based on Back to the Future, Jurassic Park and Minions are among the few rides that will not be under cover. There will be a stunt show based on 007, similar to the The Bourne Stuntacular in Florida. \"If you look at Epic Universe, the newest park they're opening in Florida, a lot of those rides are indoors, too,\" the source said. A James Bond stunt show will be one of the rides for visitors to experience at the Universal UK attraction Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast the theme park would be an opportunity to show off \"great British creations to the world\". \"These are things like James Bond, Paddington Bear, these are things like Harry Potter. We've got so much to be proud of,\" she said. Notably, a Harry Potter-themed area will not be part of the park, as it is situated just a 40-minute drive from the Warner Bros Studio Tour in Leavesden, Hertfordshire. Attractions based on JK Rowling's characters and settings are a popular feature of other Universal resorts. This video can not be played Drone video shows Universal theme park site Does Bedford want a Universal theme park? How PM might tackle impact of Trump tariffs What do we know about Universal's UK plans? The source told the BBC that \"watertight exclusivity contracts\" made it difficult to include Hogwarts in the plans, although it could be reconsidered alongside other brands such as Nintendo or Wicked if the park were to expand in the future. \"Warner Bros has the UK rights to Harry Potter attractions. They tried to find a way round it but couldn't. That could change in years to come, though,\" the source said. Warner Bros Studio Tour has been invited to comment. Rides based on Paddington are expected to be at the park Universal Destinations and Experiences is expecting 8.5 million visitors a year at the park. Transport links close to the site will require significant improvements to accommodate the new arrivals, which the government says it is committed to. Universal previously described the site as \"an ideal location with convenient, fast rail links to London and London Luton Airport\". The borough's mayor, Tom Wootton, a Conservative, said: \"Bedford is the perfect place for this investment â well-connected, full of talent and ready to grow.  \"We're proud to be chosen as the home of Universal in the UK. I'm delighted that our residents and communities will benefit in the years and decades ahead.\" Scenes from the latest Lord of the Rings Amazon series were filmed nearby at Bovingdon Airfield Studios, Hertfordshire Luton Airport is hoping to double annual passenger numbers to 32 million by 2043, after Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander recently approved its expansion plans. Visitors to the park who land at the airport could catch a train at Luton Airport Parkway on the Midland Main Line line to Wixams, which will be Universal's nearest station. That is expected to open next year with two platforms, but Universal said it would upgrade the station, potentially with extra platforms, to meet visitor demand. The East West Rail line is currently being built to link Oxford and Cambridge. Although it is not expected to be fully operational until the 2030s, Universal has said there would be a new railway station near the park. A car park is in the conceptual art of the park. Drivers would access it via the A421, which was closed last year after it was flooded during heavy rain. Universal plans to install new slip roads on the A421 to meet increased demand.

        "title": "Gabon election: Why coup leader Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema is embracing democracy",
        "content": "Little more than 19 months after the bloodless coup that brought an end to more than five decades of rule by the Bongo family, the people of Gabon are about to head to the polls to choose a new head of state - bucking a trend that has seen military leaders elsewhere in Africa cling on to power. The overwhelming favourite in the race on Saturday is the man who led that peaceful putsch and has dominated the political scene ever since, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema. Having abandoned his soldier's fatigues and military status in favour of a politician's suit, this highly articulate former commander of the elite Republican Guard faces seven other candidates. Basking in popularity among a population relieved to be rid of dynastic rule - and assisted by electoral regulations that disqualified some key challengers - the 50-year-old appears almost certain to secure an outright majority in the first ballot. His campaign slogan - using his initials \"C'BON\" - is a play on the French words \"c'est bon\", meaning \"it's good\". Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, the last prime minister under ousted President Ali Bongo, is the coup leader's main rival His chances of avoiding a second round run-off are bolstered by the fact that his main challenger - one of the rare senior political or civil society figures not to have rallied to his cause - is the old regime's last prime minister, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, known by his initials ACBBN. Victory will bring a seven-year mandate and the resources to implement development and modernising reform at a pace that the rulers of crisis-beset African countries could not even dream of. With only 2.5 million people, Gabon is an established oil producer and the world's second-largest exporter of manganese. Its territory, which sits astride the equator, encompasses some of the most biodiverse tracts of the Congo Basin rainforest. And other than a harsh post-election crackdown in the capital, Libreville, in 2016, the country has enjoyed a mostly calm recent history that contrasts with the conflicts and instability that have afflicted many regional neighbours. Oligui Nguema and his Republican Guards met no resistance when they seized power on 30 August 2023, just hours after the electoral authorities had taken to the airwaves in the middle of the night to proclaim that the incumbent President, Ali Bongo Ondimba, had secured a third seven-year term with a crushing 64% of the vote. It was hard to see this official result as credible. Ali Bongo, who succeeded his father Omar in 2009, had only squeaked a narrow and much disputed victory in the previous poll, in 2016. When he suffered a stroke while visiting Saudi Arabia two years later and embarked on a painstaking gradual recovery there had been widespread popular sympathy. But the mood shifted after he decided to stand for a third term, despite his visibly frail state of health - this fuelled widespread resentment at the supposed behind-the-throne influence and ambitions of his French-born wife Sylvia and his son Nourredin Bongo Valentin. The military's peaceful intervention to forestall a continuation of the regime, arresting Sylvia and Nourredin and confining Ali in enforced retirement in his private villa, triggered spontaneous celebrations among the many Gabonese who had grown weary of this apparently immovable dynasty. Voters in the oil-rich nation, where more than a third of the population lives in poverty, will get to choose from eight presidential candidates And the coup was greeted with relief even by most of the administrative, political and civil society elite. Oligui Nguema took shrewd advantage, reaching out to build a broad base of support for his transitional regime. He brought former government figures, opponents and prominent hitherto critical civil society voices into the power structure or institutions such as the appointed senate. Political detainees were freed, though Ali Bongo's wife and son remain in detention awaiting trial on corruption charges. He did not resort to the sort of crackdowns on dissent or media freedom that have become a routine tool of Francophone Africa's other military leaders, in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger. Oligui Nguema, unlike military leaders in West Africa, has maintained cordial relations with France and President Macron On the diplomatic front, in marked contrast to the assertively anti-Western posture adopted by the regimes in West Africa, Oligui Nguema despatched senior figures to cultivate international goodwill and reassure Gabon's traditional partners of his determination to restore civilian constitutional government within a tightly limited timeframe. Relations with France, the former colonial power and previously a close ally of the Bongo regime, are warm. The two governments recently agreed to transform Camp de Gaulle, the longstanding French base in Gabon, into a new training centre that they will operate jointly. Displaying a deft popular and political touch, Oligui Nguema has responded to public hunger for change with an acceleration of public works and delayed projects. And at a time of rising popular support across Francophone Africa for a more visibly assertive defence of national interests, his government has acquired the Gabonese assets of several foreign oil companies, including the UK's Tullow. An ambitious plan was launched last year to upgrade Gabon's only railway, which is built through dense equatorial forest To ease constraints on government finances, he has borrowed on the regional money market, but has also shrewdly sought to reassure international partners. Much of the $520m (Â£461m) raised through a Eurobond in February has been used to pay off old debt, and the government has also set aside funds to clear some arrears owed to the World Bank. But if, and almost certainly when, he is elected as Gabon's head of state on Saturday, Oligui Nguema will face significant challenges. Such was the public's hunger for change that, in many ways, the transition has been the easy part. There has been little public pressure constraining his freedom of manoeuvre. There was broad consensus over incorporating a ban on dynastic succession in the new constitution. When Oligui Nguema brushed off some parliamentarians' concern about the concentration of executive power in the presidency by abolishing the post of prime minister, there was little fuss. But this does mean that, going forward, the full weight of responsibility for meeting public expectations will fall on his shoulders alone. Prominent political and civil society figures, such as veteran opponent Alexandre Barro-Chambrier and rainforest campaigner Marc Ona Essangui, have joined his transitional administration or political machine, the Rassemblement des BÃ¢tisseurs (RDB), and could well occupy important roles post-election. Nonetheless the focus will be on Oligui Nguema himself. And he will face complex challenges. Nearly 90% of Gabon is covered by forest and the OgoouÃ© River, pictured here near the inland city of LambarÃ©nÃ©, flows through the middle Gabon has long positioned itself as a leader in conserving the rainforest and its enormously diverse flora and fauna, attracting international praise for its astute use of climate finance tools - in 2023 it became the first sub-Saharan country to complete a debt-for-nature swap. But this strategic approach has to be reconciled with the economic pressure to make full use of other natural resources, particularly minerals and oil, and with the needs of rural communities seeking to protect their hunting and farming rights. Urban populations, particularly in Libreville - home to almost half the country's population - need more jobs and better services, in a country whose social development record has been disappointing, given its relative affluence.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Michelle Trachtenberg on the red carpet over the years US actress Michelle Trachtenberg died a natural death from complications caused by diabetes, according to the New York City medical examiner's office. The 39-year-old actress was found \"unconscious and unresponsive\" in her New York City apartment in February. Officials did not perform a post-mortem examination, but said toxicology tests determined Trachtenberg's cause of death.  The US actress was best known for playing Buffy the Vampire Slayer's younger sister Dawn Summers, and later took on the role of manipulative socialite Georgina Sparks in Gossip Girl as an adult. Trachtenberg's family, who are Orthodox Jews, had reportedly objected to an autopsy, citing religious reasons.   Because there was no sign of foul play, the medical examiner did not overrule the relatives' objection. An unnamed source told NBC News the actress had received a liver transplant before her death. The exact timing or reasoning of the operation is unclear. Trachtenberg's sudden death shocked her fans. She rose to fame as a childhood star making her debut in a number of Nickelodeon projects including the film Harriet the Spy. In the early 2000s, she was nominated for several acting awards - including a Daytime Emmy Award - for her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also starred in films including EuroTrip, Ice Princess, Killing Kennedy, and Sister Cities. Following her death, fellow actors paid tribute. Blake Lively, a Gossip Girl co-star, said everything Trachtenberg did \"she did 200%\". \"She laughed the fullest at someone's joke... she cared deeply about her work, she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself,\" Lively wrote on social media.

        "title": "Tariffs will hit US economy and raise prices - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell",
        "content": "Donald Trump has attacked the head of the US central bank for not cutting interest rates, stating that Jerome Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough!\". The US president took to social media to renew his criticism of Powell ahead of the third interest rate cut this year by European Central Bank (ECB). On Thursday, it announced that it had reduced the key rate \"owing to rising trade tensions\". Trump, who nominated Powell as Federal Reserve chair in 2017 during his first term, wrote that he \"is always TOO LATE AND WRONG\" on reducing borrowing costs. Trump continued:  \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now.\" While oil prices have fallen since the start of the month when Trump unveiled his tariff regime, eggs prices have risen to $6.23 per dozen, according to official data.  Meanwhile, the BBC has found no evidence for Trump's claims about how much money the US is collecting from tariffs. As Trump attacked Powell, Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB defended her American counterpart.  \"I have a lot of respect for my friend and esteemed colleague Jay Powell,\" said Lagarde as she discussed the decision to cut European interest rates from 2.5% to 2.25%.  \"We have a solid, steady relationship amongst central bankers.\" No global recession despite US tariffs, says IMF The president lashed out after Powell said on Wednesday that US economic growth will be hit and prices will rise for consumers as a result of Trump's tariffs. He said the import taxes were larger than the bank had expected, going beyond the higher end of its estimates. There has been turmoil on global stock markets as investors reacted to the tariffs and an escalating trade war between the US and China. Mr Powell said: \"The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated.  \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\" The US president has said tariffs will boost US manufacturing and jobs but economists have warned they risk fuelling inflation. Trump campaigned on cutting inflation.  It is not the first time that Trump has targeted Powell, who he nominated to replace Janet Yellen who the president accused of keeping interest rates too low. The president's campaign promises included calls for lower interest rates in order to bring relief to borrowers. Since returning to office, Trump has stoked a trade war by introducing a 10% tax on goods being imported to the US from the vast majority of countries. He has escalated tariffs further with China by putting a 145% tax on Chinese goods, though there are some exemptions for smartphones. China has hit back with tariffs of 125% on US products. The White House said on Wednesday that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Trump tariffs spark US government debt sell-off Mr Powell said that despite the uncertainty and ructions in the markets, the \"US economy is still in a solid position\". For now, he said, the Fed could keep its benchmark interest rate steady \"to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments\". The Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently set in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, where it has been since December following a series of rate cuts late last year. If tariffs push up inflation, as many economists expect, the Fed could decide to hold or even raise rates. Traders on Wednesday kept their bets it will continue to cut rates this year. But the Fed also has a mandate to maintain maximum employment as well as stable prices. Should it be caught between rising inflation and a rising unemployment rate, Mr Powell said \"we would consider how far the economy is from each goal\" and then look at \"the potentially different time horizons\" for getting prices under control and bringing the unemployment rate down. \"As that great Chicagoan Ferris Bueller once noted, \"life moves pretty fast\", he added.

        "title": "UK bans EU cheese and meat imports to prevent disease spreading",
        "content": "The UK government has brought in a temporary ban on holidaymakers bringing in cheese and meat products from the EU in a bid to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Travellers have not been allowed to bring back items such as cured meat and cheese, including in sandwiches, since Saturday due to the growing outbreak on the continent. The restrictions apply regardless of whether the goods are packed or packaged, or bought from duty free. It follows an earlier ban of similar products from Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and Austria after rising cases of the cattle disease in those countries. FMD is a highly infectious virus that causes blisters inside an animal's mouth and under their hooves, and can cause lameness and problems feeding. It causes no risk to humans and there are currently no cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK. Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could potentially be contaminated with FMD.  There are concerns that if contaminated products enter the UK, even if they are designed for human consumption, there is a chance that they could be consumed by animals - for instance if they are thrown away in a way that could come into contact with foraging wildlife or domestic livestock. The restrictions apply to people arriving in Great Britain, not Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man. Products will be seized and destroyed if people try to bring them in, and in \"serious cases\" people could be fined up to Â£5,000. The list of restricted products includes: pork beef lamb mutton goat venison other products made from these meats, for example sausages milk and dairy products like butter, cheese and yoghurt People can bring up to 2kg per person of powdered infant milk, infant food, or special food needed for medical reasons. UK ban on EU cheese and meat: What it means for you In 2001, an outbreak of FMD in the UK led to the culling of millions of animals. Although there were only 2,000 confirmed cases, more than six million sheep, cattle and pigs were slaughtered. This is because each of those cases meant a farm having all of its livestock killed and burned. The last outbreak of FMD in the UK was in 2007, although this was much smaller with only eight infected premises concentrated in one small area of the country. Tom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers Union (NFU), said the government had been quick to bring in the initial ban and the NFU was glad it was now being extended. \"While the FMD source remains unidentified in parts of Europe, stricter border controls are essential,\" he said. \"It's imperative we have a comprehensive cross-government biosecurity plan with the necessary investment behind it, and which would place these restrictions on a permanent legislative footing.\" The Guild of Fine Food, which represents independent food and drink retailers, said the ban on \"holiday treats\" had been \"hurried\", but added it brought UK government policy for holidaymakers more in line with restrictions already placed on small businesses. \"The food and drink industry absolutely supports the fact that we must protect our farmers and that biosecurity is paramount,\" said John Farrand, managing director of the Guild of Fine Food. However, he said that \"bureaucracy\" brought in after Brexit had added \"significant constraints\" for small food and drink importers and exporters.

        "title": "US judge rules he could hold Trump administration in contempt",
        "content": "Federal judge James Boasberg ordered a 14-day halt to the deportations but the flights to El Salvador went ahead A US judge has said he could hold the Trump administration in contempt of court for \"wilful disregard\" of an order to halt the departure of deportation flights carrying more than 200 people to El Salvador last month.  The administration had invoked a 227-year-old law meant to protect the US during wartime to carry out the mass deportation.  \"The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,\" federal judge James Boasberg wrote. In a statement, the White House said it would contest the decision. White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said: \"We plan to seek immediate appellate relief\", referring to a process in which parties can request a higher court review and potentially change a decision made by a lower court.  \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country.\" Judge Boasberg's decision to begin contempt proceedings escalates a clash between the White House and the judiciary over the president's powers. The administration could avoid a contempt finding, or \"purge\" itself of contempt, if they provide an explanation of their actions and come into compliance with the original order issued last month, Boasberg said on Wednesday.  That filing is due by 23 April, he said.  His ruling comes despite the Supreme Court's later finding that Donald Trump could in fact use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to conduct the deportations to El Salvador.  The Supreme Court's ruling against Boasberg's temporary restraining order \"does not excuse the Government's violation\", he said. If the administration does not provide the requested information by the 23 April deadline, Boasberg will then seek to identify the individual people who ignored the order to stop the deportations.  He could then recommend prosecutions for those involved. Federal prosecutions come under the US justice department which ultimately reports to the Trump administration. More than 200 alleged gang members were deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT high-security prison  The March deportation flights saw more than 200 Venezuelans accused by the White House of being gang members deported to a jail in El Salvador. During a 15 March hearing, Judge Boasberg imposed a temporary restraining order on the use of the wartime law and a 14-day halt to deportations covered by the proclamation. After lawyers told him that the planes had already departed, he issued a verbal order for the flights to be turned around to the US. The White House denied violating the court ruling. US press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order. \"The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.\" After two deportation flights continued to El Salvador despite his order that they be turned around, Judge Boasberg convened a hearing to discuss \"possible defiance\" of his ruling by the Trump administration. In response, Trump took to TruthSocial to call Boasberg a \"troublemaker and agitator\" and call for his impeachment. El Salvador has agreed to take in the deportees in exchange for $6m (Â£4.6m). Earlier this week, Trump met with El Salvdador's President, Nayib Bukele, at the White House, and expressed an interest in sending more deportation flights to El Salvador.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Swedish elk beginning their annual migration Every spring for the past six years, millions of people have tuned in to a round-the-clock livestream of elk on the move in northern Sweden. \"The Great Moose Migration\" tracks the animals as they swim across the Angerman River and make their annual journey toward greener, summer pastures. This year's 24-hour programme from SVT Play, the streaming platform for Sweden's national broadcaster, began on Tuesday - a week ahead of schedule because of the warmer weather this April. The broadcast has become a \"slow TV\" phenomenon, cultivating a loyal fanbase since its inception in 2019. Cait Borjesson, 60, who has been hooked to the annual livestream, external since she stumbled upon it during the Covid-19 pandemic, said her TV had been on for 16 straight hours since it began on Tuesday. \"It's unbelievably relaxing,\" she said. \"There's the natural sounds of the birds, the wind, the trees. It gives you a sense that you're in nature even if you're not\".  For Cait, watching the migration has become a yearly tradition, so much so that she books time off work to fully immerse herself in the three-week broadcast. She said the stream was \"like therapy\" which had helped her anxiety and panic attacks. And she is not alone. SVT's livestream has a wide audience, including a Facebook group boasting more than 77,000 members who come together to share their memorable moments, emotional reactions to the broadcast and their shared fascination of the migration. A major part of their journey captured by SVT is through the village of Kullberg in northern Sweden, next to the Angerman. The animals are known as moose in North America, and elk in Europe. Goran Ericsson, dean of the faculty of forest sciences at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and science advisor for the broadcast, said the elk migrate back to the summer ranges after aggregating in spots with better temperatures in the winter. \"Historically, this migration has been going on since the ice age,\" he said. \"During spring and summer, moose are more evenly spread out in the landscape.\" He added that around 95% of the elk in northern Sweden migrate annually, adding that early migrations were not new with this year's prompted by less snow on the ground.  \"Early springs happen occasionally,\" he said. \"We're still within the normal range of variation.\" More than 30 cameras are used to capture the elk as they move through the vast landscapes, he added. The show drew in nearly a million people during its launch in 2019, before garnering nine million viewers in 2024. Minh-Xuan Truong, a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences who has surveyed viewers of the livestream, said in a fast-paced media environment, people enjoy experiencing nature through this \"slow TV\" style - a genre characterised by long, un-edited and real-time broadcasts. \"A lot of people say it's like an open window to a forest,\" he says. \"When you ask them if they would prefer having music in the background, or commentary, they say they prefer just having the sound of the wind, the birds and trees.\" Sweden's woodlands are home to about 300,000 elk. The animal is known in the Scandinavian country as \"King of the Forest\".

        "title": "Donald Trump's tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",
        "content": "WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called US-China relations \"really worrying\" at a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday The World Trade Organization (WTO) has forecast that global trade will fall this year because of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. It added \"severe downside risks\", including reciprocal tariffs and political uncertainty, could lead to an even sharper decline in global goods trade.  \"The decline is expected to be particularly steep in North America,\" the WTO said, forecasting trade to drop by more than a tenth in that region. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director general, called the \"decoupling\" of the US and China \"a phenomenon that is really worrying to me\". The WTO previously expected global goods trade to expand by 2.7% in 2025 but it now forecasts it will fall by 0.2%. Chief economist Ralph Ossa said: \"Tariffs are a policy lever with wide-ranging, and often unintended consequences. \"Our simulations show that trade policy uncertainty has a significant dampening effect on trade flows, reducing exports and weakening economic activity,\" he added. Also on Wednesday, the UN trade and development body, UNCTAD, released its own report which forecasts global growth to slow to 2.3% in 2025 due to escalating trade tensions and uncertainty. It said the projection was below \"the 2.5% threshold widely viewed as signalling a global recession\". Tariffs will hit US economy and raise prices, says Fed boss A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April, although some countries and goods are exempt. China has a much higher tariff, which now totals 145% on most goods. The US stock market slid on opening on Wednesday with the big indexes falling amid the ongoing uncertainty. Despite the prediction of plunging trade with the US, the WTO expects some regions will still see trade growth. It said Asia and Europe were still projected to post modest growth in both exports and imports this year. \"The collective contribution to world trade growth of other regions would also remain positive,\" the WTO report said. For the first time, the report contains a forecast for services trade - which is when countries buy and sell services to each other instead of goods. This is common in industries such as tourism or finance where nothing physical is shipped but a service is provided. The WTO forecasts services trade to grow by 4% in 2025, which is around one percentage point less than expected. Since Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs. The US president says the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. However, critics say bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime. Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements. Just hours after steep levies against roughly 60 of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries bar China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets. In March, the governor of the Bank of England has warned that Trump's tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers' pockets.

        "title": "World Health Organization agrees legally binding pandemic treaty",
        "content": "French ambassador for global health Anne-Claire Amprou and WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus after the treaty was agreed Members of the World Health Organization (WHO) have agreed the text of a legally binding treaty designed to better tackle future pandemics. The pact is meant to avoid the disorganisation and competition for resources seen during the Covid-19 outbreak. Key elements include the rapid sharing of data about new diseases, to ensure scientists and pharmaceutical companies can work more quickly to develop treatments and vaccines. For the first time, the WHO itself will also have an overview of global supply chains for masks, medical gowns and other personal protective equipment (PPE). WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the deal as \"a significant milestone in our shared journey towards a safer world\". \"[Member states] have also demonstrated that multilateralism is alive and well, and that in our divided world, nations can still work together to find common ground, and a shared response to shared threats,\" he said. The legally binding pact reached early on Wednesday came after three years of talks between member states. It is only the second time in the WHO's 75-year history that an international agreement of this type has been reached â the first being a tobacco control deal in 2003. It still needs to be formally adopted by members when they meet for the World Health Assembly next month. US negotiators were not part of the final discussions after President Donald Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the global health agency, and the US will not be bound by the pact when it leaves in 2026. Under the terms agreed, countries will have to ensure that pandemic-related drugs are available across the world in a future outbreak. Participating manufacturers will have to allocate 10% of their production of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to the WHO. Another 10% will then be supplied at \"affordable prices\". Countries also approved the transfer of health technologies to poorer nations as long as it was \"mutually agreed\". That should enable more local production of vaccines and medicines during a pandemic, but the clause had been extremely contentious. Developing countries are still angry at the way wealthy nations bought up and hoarded vaccines during Covid-19, while countries with large pharmaceutical industries worry mandatory transfers might undermine research and development. At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies.  That should enable those firms to start working on new drugs more quickly in any future outbreak.

        "title": "Enfield oak tree felled by Toby Carvery 'had hundreds of years to live'",
        "content": "The felled tree is located on the edge of Whitewebbs Park, near a Toby Carvery An ancient oak felled in a north London park on the order of Toby Carvery's owners was healthy and could have lived \"for another few hundred years\", the leader of the local council has said. Pub chain Mitchells & Butlers (M&B) said on Tuesday it was responsible for chopping down the 500-year-old tree, \"to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public\". An Enfield Council planning document from March 2024 stated that the pedunculate oak was a \"fine specimen\" with high ecological and landscape value and had a life expectancy of at least 50 years. But council leader Ergin Erbil said a more recent inspection found the tree could have lived for several more centuries. He said: \"Our experts surveyed this tree in December and they said it's healthy... so I completely oppose the argument from the leaseholder that this posed a health and safety risk.\" Describing the felling of the tree as an \"outrage\", Mr Erbil added that M&B \"did not consult us as the landowner, and they should have\". The oak, which was cut down on 3 April, was located on the edge of council-owned Whitewebbs Park and overlooked a Toby Carvery. Enfield Council said on Tuesday it had reported the felling as a case of criminal damage to the Met Police, which is understood to have closed its inquiry, deeming it a civil matter. A local took a picture of a cherry-picker operating at the tree The planning document, based on a November 2023 inspection, stated that the tree was in \"moderate good\" condition and recommended a \"light reduction of the upper crown on [the] north side\". On Tuesday, an M&B source initially said that the company had approved the cutting down of the oak after being told the tree was dead.  In an official statement hours later, M&B stated it had received advice from contractors, who said \"the split and dead wood posed a serious health and safety risk\". M&B subsequently removed this statement in a further update, but maintained it had taken \"necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met\".  The BBC has asked the company for information about the contractor that cut down the tree. M&B has not provided this and has also declined the BBC's request for an interview. This video can not be played The BBC's Harry Low rounds up reaction to the oak's felling Dr Ed Pyne, senior conservation adviser for trees at the Woodland Trust, said of the cutting down of the oak: \"I couldn't quite believe it, to be honest.  \"I've been working with trees in various capacities now as an arborist, as an academic for close to 14 years and in all that time I don't think I've seen a tree-felling as shocking as this.\" The tree, with a girth of 6m (20ft), was a nationally significant pedunculate oak listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory. News of the destruction of the oak came just two days after a report from the charity Tree Council and the Forest Research organisation, external warned that trees were only indirectly protected, with some \"significant legal gaps\". It recommended the development of a \"robust and effective system\" to ensure they were safeguarded. Russell Miller is an expert on ancient trees The Enfield oak was worth Â£1m, according to tree valuer Russell Miller, who made his estimate using the Capital Asset Value for Amenity Trees system, external. Mr Miller said it was \"much older and much more valuable\" than the Sycamore Gap tree cut down in Northumberland in 2023. He added: \"This tree is designated... as an irreplaceable habitat because it's got decay features and habitats within it that you cannot replace within hundreds of years. \"In addition to the sorts of species that people are familiar with, like bats and owls that live in these trees, you've got thousands of species of invertebrate. \"You've got lots of different niches for lots of different species inside the tree, and that's why they're so special.\" Ancient oak tree cut down by Toby Carvery Sycamore Gap tree: The story so far A spokesperson for M&B said: \"The tree was cut back after we were advised by our specialist arboriculture contractors that it caused a potential health and safety risk. \"This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care. \"We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met. We are grateful to our specialist arboriculture contractors for warning us of this potential health and safety risk, allowing us to act swiftly to address it.\" Additional reporting by James Kelly and Gem O'Reilly Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "The UK inflation rate has eased - but how long will it last?",
        "content": "The rate of rising prices - inflation - has eased for the second month in a row, official figures show. In March, prices rose at an annual rate of 2.6%, far slower than the 11% inflation peak seen in 2022. Petrol and toy prices have fallen, a relief for drivers and parents, while food prices are unchanged. However, this data is for last month, and analysts suggest it is the \"calm before a storm\". Exact predictions are difficult, but here are three key areas where inflation is expected to rise. A host of household bills went up at the start of April, on top of continued rent rises. They included utilities such as domestic energy and water. Council tax also rose significantly for millions of people, and there were hikes for many on phone and broadband contracts, as well as the TV licence. For businesses, the rise in employer National Insurance contributions in April may have led them to immediately put up their prices. Some of these increased costs will feed into the next set of inflation data published in May. As a result, analysts think this will see the inflation rate quickly climb over 3% (remember the government and Bank of England's target is 2%). After that, there's significant uncertainty. Commentators suggest inflation may not stay as high, for as long, as previously thought, for reasons we'll come to next. The rollercoaster ride of US tariff policy has dominated the headlines and airwaves in the last few weeks. The US president announced taxes on goods imported into the US from around the world, then rowed back or delayed many, but doubled down on Chinese imports.  Some countries have hit back with tariffs of their own; others - such as the UK - are trying to negotiate. We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt. In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers. But, particularly for the UK, things are far more nuanced. The 10% tariff on UK goods imported by the US is lower than feared, and retaliation looks unlikely.  Indeed, there are heightened expectations of a UK-US trade deal, rather than a trade war. So, any price rises would be limited. China is facing massive 145% tariffs on all its goods bound for the US. If that puts up barriers to the US market, it may find other places to sell its - often cheaply manufactured - products, such as the UK. A so-called dumping of cheap Chinese products in the UK will increase price competition and could slow the rate of inflation. Growth in the UK economy has been sluggish for some time, although the latest data was more positive than many had expected. But, again connected to the issue of tariffs, there are warnings that the improvement in UK economic growth could be short-lived with some even predicting a recession. That's not good news for the government, which has made economic growth its priority.  Nor is it good news for workers, whose job security becomes less stable if businesses draw back on investment and start to cut costs. No job means less money to spend. That would bring down the inflation rate, but would be small mercy to anyone who is suddenly unemployed. Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.  And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages. Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target. So the Bank's rate-setters face a delicate balancing act for the rest of the year, starting at their next meeting in May, particularly because nobody is sure how much the tightrope is going to wobble.

        "title": "Elon Musk's Starlink and the racially charged row over operating in South Africa",
        "content": "The tussle between Starlink boss Elon Musk and South Africa over the company's failure to launch in the country stems from the nation's black empowerment laws, and could be one factor behind the diplomatic row between the US and Africa's most industrialised nation. To his more than 219 million followers on his social media platform X, Mr Musk made the racially charged claim that his satellite internet service provider was \"not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black, external\".  But the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence. As for the foreign ministry, it said the company was welcome to operate in the country \"provided there's compliance with local laws\". To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.  This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid. White-minority rule ended in 1994 after Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress (ANC) came to power.  Since then, the ANC has made \"black empowerment\" a central pillar of its economic policy in an attempt to tackle the racial injustices of the past.  This has included adopting legislation requiring investors to give local black firms a 30% stake in their businesses in South Africa. Mr Musk - who was born in South Africa in 1971 before moving to Canada in the late 1980s and then to the US, where he became the world's richest man - appears to see this as the main stumbling block for Starlink to operate in the country.  Starlink, in a written submission to Icasa, said the black empowerment provisions in legislation excluded \"many\" foreign satellite operators from the South African market, according to local news site TechCentral.  But foreign ministry spokesperson Clayson Monyela challenged this view in March, saying on X that more than 600 US companies, including computing giant Microsoft, were operating in South Africa in compliance with its laws - and \"thriving\". Mr Musk's Starlink has a potential ally in South Africa's Communications Minister Solly Malatsi.  He comes from the Democratic Alliance (DA) - the second-biggest party in South Africa - which joined a coalition government after the ANC failed to get a parliamentary majority in last year's election.  The DA is a fierce critic of the current black empowerment laws, claiming they have fuelled cronyism and corruption with investors forced to link up with ANC-connected companies to operate in South Africa or to win state contracts.  Last October, Malatsi hinted that he was looking for a way to circumvent the 30% black equity requirement, saying he intended to issue a \"policy direction\" to Icasa with the aim of clarifying \"the position on the recognition of equity equivalent programmes\". In simple terms, Malatsi seemed to be suggesting that Starlink would not require a black business partner in South Africa, though it would have to invest in social programmes aimed at benefiting black people - especially the poor. But some six months later, Malatsi has failed to change the policy, with a spokesperson for his department telling the BBC that their legal team was still looking into the matter.  It seems the communications minister may be facing political resistance from ANC lawmakers in parliament.   Khusela Diko, the chairperson of the parliamentary communications committee to which Malatsi is accountable, warned him earlier this month that \"transformation\" in the tech sector was non-negotiable, appearing to oppose giving Mr Musk's Starlink any special treatment. Diko said that \"the law is clear on compliance\" and, crucially added, that \"cutting corners and circumvention is not an option - least of all to appease business interests\".  Diko's tough position comes as no surprise, as relations between the South African government and the US have hit rock bottom during US President Donald Tump's second term.  Mr Musk, part of Trump's inner circle, has railed on X against what he calls \"racist ownership laws\" in South Africa, while the US president has threatened to boycott the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in the country later this year.  \"How could we be expected to go to South Africa for the very important G20 Meeting when Land Confiscation and Genocide is the primary topic of conversation? They are taking the land of white Farmers, and then killing them and their families,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social, external.  His claims of a genocide against white farmers have been widely dismissed as false, but they echo those of the tech billionaire.  Last month, Mr Musk accused \"a major\" political party in South Africa - a reference to the radical Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), which came fourth in last year's election - of  \"actively promoting white genocide\", external. \"A month ago, the South African government passed a law legalizing taking property from white people at will with no payment,\" Mr Musk said. \"Where is the outrage? Why is there no coverage by the legacy media? South Africa did pass a law earlier this year allowing the government to seize property without compensation, but only in certain cases. Nevertheless, Musk links these issues to his failure to get a licence for Starlink, making the comment in March that this was down to him not being black. His hard-line stance comes despite meeting South Africa's president in New York last year.  At the time, Mr Musk described the meeting as \"great\", while President Cyril Ramaphosa said he had tried to persuade the billionaire to invest in South Africa.  \"Meeting Elon Musk was a clear intention of mine... Some people call it bromance, so it's a whole process of rekindling his affection and connection with South Africa,\" Ramaphosa told South Africa's public broadcaster, SABC, external. But he added that nothing had yet been \"bedded down\".  \"As it happens with potential investors, you have to court them; you have to be talking to them, and you've got to be demonstrating to them that there is a conducive environment for them to invest. So, we will see how this turns out,\" the president said. \"He is South African-born and South Africa is his home, and I would want to see him coming to South Africa for a visit, tour or whatever.\" But the \"bromance\" has long ended, with Mr Musk appearing to move closer to South Africa's right wing. Lesotho appears to have bowed to pressure from the Trump administration by announcing on Monday that it had given a 10-year licence to Starlink.  It comes after Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports from Lesotho, threatening thousands of jobs in the country. Trump subsequently paused that for 90 days, but a 10% tariff still came into effect on 5 April. Some reports suggest the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) cleared regulatory hurdles to stave off the threat of a further tariff hike by granting Starlink a licence.  However, this was denied by Foreign Minister Lejone Mpotjoane. \"The licence application and the tariff negotiations should not be conflated,\" he said.  The decision to grant the licence was condemned by civil society group Section Two, which raised concern that Starlink Lesotho was 100% foreign-owned and lacked local ownership, South Africa's GroundUp news site reported, external. \"Such actions can only be described as a betrayal - a shameful sell-out by a government that appears increasingly willing to place foreign corporate interests above the democratic will and long-term developmental needs of the people of Lesotho,\" Section Two's co-ordinator Kananelo Boloetse was quoted as saying. During public consultations over Starlink's application, Vodacom Lesotho had also argued that Mr Musk's company should establish local shareholding before receiving a licence, the Space in Africa website reported, external.  \"These concerns highlight broader tensions surrounding Starlink's operations across Africa, particularly the growing demand for local partnerships,\" it added. Starlink also appears to be seeking an exemption in Namibia from the requirement to bring in a local partner. Namibia is a former colony of Germany, and was under the rule of South Africa's white-minority regime until it gained independence in 1990. It has more stringent requirements than its post-apartheid neighbour, with businesses operating in Namibia needing to be 51% locally owned. The Communications Regulatory Authority of Namibia (Cran) told the BBC that Starlink had submitted an application for a telecommunications service licence in June 2024.  Cran said that while this process usually took between three to six months, a decision had not yet been taken because it \"must first wait for the ownership exemption application to be finalised\" by Namibia's information and communication technology minister.  Starlink is now operating in more than 20 African countries, with Somalia, hit by an Islamist insurgency, giving it a 10-year licence on 13 April, two days before Lesotho's decision to do so. \"We welcome Starlink's entry to Somalia. This initiative aligns with our vision to deliver affordable and accessible internet services to all Somalis, regardless of where they live,\" Technology Minister Mohamed Adam Moalim Ali said.  Starlink aims to provide high-speed internet services to remote or underserved areas, making it a potential game-changer for rural areas unable to access traditional forms of connectivity such as mobile broadband and fibre. This is because Starlink, rather than relying on fibre optics or cables to transmit data, uses a network of satellites in low Earth orbit. Because they are closer to the ground, they have faster transmission speeds than traditional satellites. Nigeria was the first African state to allow Starlink to operate, in 2023. The company has since  grown into the second-biggest internet service provider in Africa's most-populous country. But Starlink still has no presence in South Africa - the continent's most industrialised nation. Enterprising locals had found a way to connect to the service by using regional roaming packages purchased in countries where the service was available. Starlink put an end to this last year while Icasa also warned local companies that those found providing the service illegally could face a hefty fine. Yet with an estimated 20% of South Africans not having access to the internet at all - many in rural areas - it could prove beneficial for both Starlink and the government to reach a compromise. For Starlink it could prove a lucrative market, while satellite broadband may help the government achieve its goal of providing universal internet access by 2030. On Monday, Ramaphosa appointed former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas as his special envoy to the US, signalling his determination to mend relations with the Trump administration.  But Jonas' appointment faced a backlash in right-wing circles, as in a 2020 speech he called Trump a \"racist homophobe\" and a \"narcissistic right-winger\". In an interview on the Money Show podcast, external, Jonas said that he made the comments when he was not in government and \"people move on\".  He acknowledged that it would be a \"long slog to rebuild understanding\", but added that South Africa's relationship with the US was \"fundamentally important\" and he was determined to improve it. Jonas' comments are not surprising as the US is a major trading partner for South Africa. With Trump having threatened a 30% tariff on its goods, Ramaphosa cannot afford to see relations continuing to deteriorate and the economy taking further knocks.

EY said it takes its responsibilities \"extremely seriously\" and will be \"fully cooperating\" with the FRC. The Post Office declined to comment. The news of the investigation comes as sub-postmaster campaigners Lee Castleton, Seema Misra, and Chris Head will be made OBEs at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from the Horizon computer system. It has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. The Post Office itself took many cases to court, prosecuting 700 people between 1999 and 2015. Ex-Post Office chair was told of IT risks in 2011 One of the unanswered questions of the Post Office inquiry is where all the money wrongly taken from victims of the Horizon scandal actually went. The FRC wants to focus specifically on the role of statutory auditors - people legally required to review the financial statements of a company - in meeting the auditing standards of that time. However, the FRC said on Wednesday the recent public hearings carried out as a broader inquiry into the Horizon scandal did not cover EY's audits of the Post Office, so will not be covered by its investigation. In June 2024, the inquiry was told the Post Office's auditors EY warned Alice Perkins, the Post Office's chair in 2011, that the Horizon software was \"a real risk\". EY was also noted as asking \"does it capture data accurately?\". Notes from the meeting with EY mention a sub-postmaster said there was \"a systems problem\" with Horizon. The inquiry heard that Ms Perkins did not raise concerns internally about this nor did she mention the EY meeting when questions about Horizon came up in years that followed.

        "title": "Supreme Court to rule on definition of a woman - live updates",
        "content": "The UK Supreme Court rules that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex Judges say the \"concept of sex is binary\" while cautioning that the landmark ruling should not be seen as victory of one side over another Transgender people still have legal protection from discrimination, the court adds - read the full 88-page judgement The Scottish government had argued that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to sex-based protections, while For Women Scotland argued they only apply to people that are born female For Women Scotland says it's grateful for the decision after a \"long road\" of legal battles, while charity Scottish Trans urges people \"not to panic\"  The Scottish government says it acted \"in good faith\" and will work with Westminster to understand the full implications of the ruling Key takeaways: Get to grips with today's developments so far This video can not be played Watch: Campaigners cheer after judge rules on definition of a woman Edited by Steven Brocklehurst Ben HattonLive reporter The Supreme Court has ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, in a decision which could have far-reaching implications for who can access single-sex services and spaces. It came about after the Scottish government included transgender women in quotas to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. Campaign group For Women Scotland argued that sex-based protections should only apply to people born female. The judges were tasked with deciding on the correct interpretation of âsexâ and âwomanâ in the main piece of legislation setting out sex-based legal protections. Specifically, they ruled that the definition of sex as used in the Equality Act 2010 is \"binary\" and decided by biology - a person who was not born as a biological female cannot obtain the legal protections the Act affords to women by changing their gender with a Gender Recognition Certificate. It's important to note that the Act still provides transgender people with protections against discrimination, and that the judges said it was not their place to weigh in on those definitions in the wider public debate. Our social affairs editor Alison Holt writes that the judgment brings clarity on the law, but the jury is still out on what day-to-day differences it will make. We're stopping our live coverage now. We appreciate there's been a lot of information and different arguments to digest. If you want to read more, we've recapped the arguments made in the case, its journey to the Supreme Court, and the judges' verdict and reactions to it. You can also read our main story on the day's events here.  Dr Michael Foran is a lecturer in public law at Glasgow University and his writing was cited in court today. He tells Radio 4's PM programme: \"The decision itself is attempting to answer a question about what the meaning of the words sex, man and woman mean in the Equality Act. Foran says the Supreme Court has \"resoundingly and unanimously\" said that the words man, woman and sex in the Equality Act are tied to biology not Gender Recognition Certificates. He stresses the importance of saying that this does not mean trans gender people have in some way lost legal protection. \"They are protected under our equality law.\" He goes on to say: \"This judgement has made it clear that it is lawful to exclude biological males from female only services, where those female only services are lawful under the Equality Act. Most public services like toilets will be.\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released another statement, following on from its earlier remarks. Its chair Baroness Kishwer Falkner welcomes the \"clarity\" the ruling brings, and says it'll have \"significant\nimplications for the interpretation of Britainâs equality laws\". \"This judgment resolves the difficulties we highlighted in our submission to the court and in our advice to the former Minister for Women and Equalities more than two years ago. \"These include the challenges faced by those seeking to maintain single-sex spaces, and the rights of same-sex attracted persons to form associations.\" She adds that the EHRC will be working \"at pace\" to incorporate the \"implications of this judgment\" into its updated code of practice, which is expected to be laid before Parliament before the summer recess.  This code helps service\nproviders, public bodies and associations to understand their duties under the\nEquality Act and put them into practice This morning, Lord Hodge finally set out the position of the UK's highest court on the legal definition of a woman, when he took just shy of 17 minutes to read an 88-page statement. The verdict? The legal definition of a woman - which was disputed in the context of the Equality Act - is based on biological sex.  You can scroll back through the page to get a sense of the reaction - from women's rights groups' tears and cheers, to trans peoples' concern about an uncertain future. And, for a reminder of how it all began, here's a video of the moment Lord Hodge announced the much-anticipated judgement: This video can not be played Watch: Judge rules that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex \"I believe today was the day that transgender rights in the UK died\", writes Willoughby in the Metro Broadcaster and trans campaigner India Willoughby says her heart is broken following this morning's Supreme Court ruling. In an opinion piece for the Metro, external, Willoughby writes that she was \"numb in shock\" after listening to a judge \"effectively strip me of my rights as a woman under the Equality Act\". \"Telling me, and others like me, that we are not women is a historical injustice and the celebrations of anti-trans voices today prove to me that I am losing protections\", she adds. Willoughby says the judgement is \"horrible and utterly degrading\", and has left trans people \"unsure of where they stand in law\". \"I have always been a woman â and I will always be a woman. I had to fight for it, and nobody will ever take that away from me.\" James CookScotland editor The case which led to todayâs\njudgement centred on a law passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2018 which\naimed to ensure gender balance on public boards. The judges ruled that trans\nwomen could not be defined as women for the purposes of that law. \"The issue\nhere is only whether the appointment of a trans woman who has a GRC (Gender Recognition Certificate) counts as\nthe appointment of a woman and so counts towards achieving the goal set in the\ngender representation objective, namely that the board has 50% of non-executive\nmembers who are women. In our judgment it does not,\" they said. Elsewhere in the\n88-page ruling, Lord Hodge, Lady Rose and Lady Simler write: âThe definition of\nsex in the Equality Act 2010 makes clear that the concept of sex is binary, a\nperson is either a woman or a man.â And they say:\nâAlthough the word âbiologicalâ does not appear in this definition, the\nordinary meaning of those plain and unambiguous words corresponds with the\nbiological characteristics that make an individual a man or a woman. âThese are\nassumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation.\" The language is strikingly at\nodds with the campaigning cry of trans rights activists: \"Trans women are\nwomen.\" That was seized on by the\nConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, who said: \"Saying 'trans women\nare women' was never true in fact, and isn't true in law either.\" There was little sign of\ngroups taking the opposite view outside the hearing, apart from a solitary\nprotester who shouted: \"Trans rights are human rights.\"  Reaction has been pouring in to the UK Supreme Court judgement earlier today. Let's summarise some of what has happened so far: Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent, at the Supreme Court Itâs important to note that transgender people are still protected by the Equality Act. The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed  there are other protections against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment. He was clear that trans people are a âvulnerable and often harassed minorityâ, who âstruggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignityâ. But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a gender recognition certificate (GRC). Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers canât ask to see the certificate. They say the law needs to be âclear and consistentâ - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be âincoherentâ. Susan Egelstaff, a former Olympian and Herald columnist believes this morning's judgement is the right ruling: \"I think it's the right way going forward.\" She tells Radio Scotland: \"In a sporting context, I think it is right that trans women aren't able to compete against biological women in the female category.\" \"Individuals should be allowed to live how they want, dress how they want, do what they want, but there are some areas I think should be protected for biological females.  \"Sport is one of those areas.\" The Equality and Human Rights Commission will review and revise guidance on trans rights in response to today's verdict, the Scottish government's finance minister Shona Robison told BBC News. Robison said the administration would work with the EHRC and the UK government \"at pace\" on a \"new set\" of guidance. She added that the interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act was made \"in good faith\" by the Scottish government and the EHRC but there was \"inconsistency\" between the 2010 Act and the 2004 gender recognition bill, and that today's verdict can bring \"clarity\" to the issue. Trans rights are still \"protected\", Ms Robison added, and the EHRC should \"engage with everyone\" regarding the guidance.   She said: \"We need to reassure everyone that in Scotland the rights of everyone are protected, and sometimes that's been a bit lost in this debate.\" Independent MP Rosie Duffield, who has been a high-profile gender-critical campaigner, tells the BBC the supreme court ruling is a \"relief because so many women have been fighting against misinterpretation of the law for many years\". Duffield, who resigned from Labour last year, says that \"the consequences will be that men cannot opt into women-only spaces just because they say they are now a woman\". \"That's great for women, particularly for lesbians who want to meet in a single-sex safe space together and exclude men,\" she says.  Duffield, who previously said she felt ostracised by Labour colleagues for opposing transgender reforms, says party leader Keir Starmer \"hasn't really handled\" the issue. Duffield says she's \"relieved to be away from Starmer's leadership\" and that he can't \"allow women like me to be stopped from standing for positions in the Labour Party\".  Our colleagues over on BBC Radio 5Live have been getting reaction to today's judgement from two MPs who were elected last year.  Lib Dem MP Anna Sabine has a young trans relative: \"if this issue is high in the media, if there's a lot of toxicity, that can directly translate to whether the young person I know is getting abused in the street.\" \"We all need to think about how we take this forward\", says Graham Leadbitter, an MP for the SNP. \"It's particularly important to remember that trans people are amongst the most discriminated against in society and they have some of the highest suicide risk\", he added.   We may have used some terminology that you are unfamiliar with during our coverage today - here is a quick rundown on what some of these terms mean and some helpful data to put it into context: Duncan Bannatyne, who's well known for starring in the TV show Dragon's Den and owns the gym franchise Bannatyne's, has welcomed the ruling on social media. He posted on X saying: \"I hope all gym owners will join me now in agreeing that single sex spaces for women means biological women.\" \"No gym should ever allow men into womanâs changing rooms\", he added.   The issue of who can use single sex spaces, such as toilets and gym changing rooms, was one of the motivations behind the Supreme Court case - as our BBC Scotland political correspondent explains.    Charity Scottish Trans says it is \"really shocked\" by the outcome of the Supreme Court case. Manager Vic Valentine says the judgement \"reverses twenty years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with Gender Recognition Certificates.\" \"Trans people need to be able to recover on hospital wards,\nuse toilets, go swimming and access services just like anyone else,\" they add. \"This\njudgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be\nexcluded from both menâs and womenâs spaces and services.  \"It is hard to\nunderstand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is\ncompatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\" The campaigner says Scottish Trans will continue pushing for trans people to be able to \"get on with our lives with privacy, dignity and safety\". Gabriela PomeroyLive reporter The definition of a woman:  The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the legal\ndefinition of a woman under the Equality Act 2010 is based on the biological sex people are born with. The decision follows a legal case between the Scottish\ngovernment and a women's rights group, For Women Scotland, about equalities\nlegislation. Protection for transgender people: The judges emphasised that gender reassignment was still protected in law so it's\nillegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are trans. So what does it mean for toilets, gym changing rooms\nand domestic abuse shelters? The suggestion is that women-only spaces will be for biological\nwomen only. But the BBCâs social affairs editor says legal and public\npolicy experts will now be trying to work out the implications for day-to-day life. Trans activists hit out at judgement: \"We are devastated, and in tears,\" says the director of the advocacy group TransActual UK. If trans women canât be in women-only spaces, âit means we canât participate in society\". Others celebrate: Harry Potter author JK Rowling says this protects the rights of women and girls across the UK, while Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch says it's a victory: \"Women are women and men are men: you cannot change your biological sex.\" Alison HoltSocial affairs editor The Supreme Court judgement on gender has brought clarity to\na hotly disputed area of the law, but it is less clear how much difference it\nwill make in everyday life.  There is already Equality Act guidance which allows for\nwomen only spaces, such as toilets, changing rooms and hospital wards in\ncertain circumstances.  It says this could be for âreasons of privacy, decency, to\nprevent trauma or to ensure health and safetyâ. The Supreme Court justices also emphasised that transgender\npeople have existing protections against discrimination and harassment under\nthe Act. And some who have gender recognition certificates, have another layer\nof legal protection.  Overall, it is not straightforward in practical terms, which\nmeans legal and public policy experts will now be trying to work out the\nimplications.  So, while the judgment brings clarity on the law, the jury\nis still out on what day-to-day differences it will make.  Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent, at the Supreme Court The law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen. The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one. There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the Equality Act - which is Westminster legislation. The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling. There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case. For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they canât comment on live litigation. They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this issue is still just about the last thing they want to talk about. There had been some speculation a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood. But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon. With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate. But with For Women Scotland now hoping to use this ruling to hold his feet to fire when it comes to broader government policies and guidance, it is one he will need to address. If you're just joining us, we're continuing to bring you reaction to the Supreme Court ruling today that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. \"We are devastated, and in tears,\" says Jane Fae, director of the advocacy group TransActual UK - before telling the BBC's World At One programme that the judgement is like a \"physical punch\". \"What it feels like\nfor pretty much every trans, non-binary person in the UK is that you'd like to\nexclude us wholesale from UK society. So today we're feeling very alone.\" The judgement \"opens up a can of worms\", and at the moment it's not clear which spaces this applies to, Fae says. If the ruling means \"any space that you might associate\nwith women can now be used to exclude trans women... it means we canât participate in society\", she adds.  There are implications for trans men, too, Fae says: âYou are going to see some very moustachioed,\nbalding, whiskered trans men in womenâs loos if you go down that road, and it's\npossible that trans men could be doubly excluded so they are not allowed in womenâs\nspaces as trans men but not allowed in trans places as women - it is very confusing.â Sheelagh McClarenBBC Scotland In our earlier post, we touched on what today's ruling could mean for transgender people in sport, and now we've heard from Sharron Davies - a former British swimming champion who has previously said trans athletes should not compete in female competitions in order to \"protect women's sport\". She says she's \"extremely pleased\" by today's judgement. \"I think itâs just really important that we can define what a woman is,\" Davies tells me.  Today's ruling did not concern sports directly, but Davies says she hopes organisations including the Football Association and the English Cricket Board will now take notice and \"stop discriminating against women and girls\". \"It doesnât mean to say that we canât respect people across the whole of society, however they wish to present themselves\", she says. \"My position was always one that, biologically, women are very different from men\", Davies goes on, saying it's time for sports to \"protect every female athlete\". For context: In recent years, many sports have tightened up rules around transgender athletes at the elite level. Athletics, cycling and aquatics, for example, have banned transgender women from taking part in womenâs events. Other sports have instead put in place eligibility criteria. Earlier this month the English Football Association introduced stricter rules, but still allowed transgender women to continue to compete in the womenâs game as long as their testosterone was kept below a certain level.  In 2022, British Triathlon became the first British sporting body to establish an open category in which transgender athletes can compete. Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "title": "Joe Biden gives first speech since leaving White House",
        "content": "The former president described social security as a \"sacred promise.\" Joe Biden has used his first speech since leaving office to criticise the Trump administration's welfare policies. The ex-US president told a conference in Chicago that the government had \"taken a hatchet\" to the Social Security system, which Donald Trump and Elon Musk - who is leading the White House's cost-cutting efforts - say is beset by fraud. The administration wants to cut staff at the agency responsible for spending $1.6 trillion (Â£1.2 trillion) in benefits a year. Biden did not refer to Trump by name during his speech on Tuesday, but said: \"In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breath-taking.\" This video can not be played Watch: Biden attacks Trump in first speech since leaving White House He described Social Security as a \"sacred promise\", adding: \"We know just how much Social Security matters to people's lives.\" Biden - who was speaking at a disability rights event - did not address his departure from the White House or the 2024 presidential election.  The Social Security Agency (SSA) provides a base income for people in the US who are retired or cannot work because of a disability. It covers about 67 million Americans, primarily older citizens.  Democratic politicians have accused the Trump administration of planning sweeping Social Security cuts.  The White House accuses them of scaremongering, citing the Republican president's promises never to cut Social Security payments to American retirees. Trump has previously said he intends only to target fraudulent claims and payments to illegal immigrants. Members of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency have been making cuts to the agency staff since February, with the target of slashing 7,000 jobs - about 10% of its total staff. Musk has described Social Security as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time\". On Tuesday, Trump signed an order preventing illegal immigrants and \"other ineligible people\" from obtaining social security payments.  Before Biden's Chicago speech, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the president was \"absolutely certain\" about protecting benefits for \"law-abiding tax-paying American citizens and seniors\". \"He will always protect that programme,\" she added. In a post on X, the SSA - which is now controlled by a Trump appointee - said Biden had been \"lying\" during his Chicago speech. Since leaving office, Biden has kept a relatively low profile. In February, he signed with Creative Artists Agency, the Los Angeles talent agency that represented him between 2017-20. Barack Obama also criticised the Trump administration on Tuesday, saying on X that its decision to freeze more than $2bn (Â£1.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard University was \"unlawful and ham-handed\". Trump is freezing the fund because Harvard said it would not make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices that he argues are key to fighting alleged antisemitism on campus.

        "content": "US pastor Josh Sullivan has been found unharmed following a dramatic rescue An American pastor kidnapped by armed men during a church service in South Africa has been freed following a \"high-intensity shoot-out\" that left three people dead, police say. Josh Sullivan was found unharmed in the township in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday evening - the area where the 45-year-old was taken last Thursday. There were no immediate details on the kidnappers, who had made a ransom demand. There has been a dramatic increase in kidnappings for ransom in South Africa over the past decade. Mr Sullivan's kidnappers had made a ransom demand, prompting the intervention of South Africa's elite police unit, known as the Hawks. In a statement released on Wednesday morning, the Hawks said that Sullivan had been rescued following \"verified intelligence wherein a coordinated teamâ¦ moved swiftly to the identified location\". Hawks spokesperson Avele Fumba said that as the officers approached the house, the suspects attempted to flee inside a vehicle, while opening fire. \"The officers responded with tactical precision, leading to a high-intensity shootout in which three unidentified suspects were fatally wounded,\" Mr Fumba said. South Africa kidnapping: 'I survived but part of me died that day' Mr Sullivan's family and friends had made impassioned pleas for his safe return since his abduction. Jeremy Hall, the Sullivan family's spokesman, told local newspaper TimesLIVE that he was at the church with his wife and their children when he was kidnapped. \"They knew his name,\" he said at the time. Mr Sullivan describes himself as \"a church planting missionary\" on his personal website. On it, he says he moved to South Africa with his wife and children in 2018 to establish a church for Xhosa-speaking people.

        "title": "UK inflation falls as price of petrol drops",
        "content": "Falling petrol prices drove UK inflation down by more than expected in the year to March. Inflation was 2.6%, down from a rate of 2.8% in February, according to official data. But the fall may only be temporary as analysts say it's expected to spike from April as rising bills and higher business costs take hold. \"The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre. The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply. The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years. Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.  The average rise in wages was 5.9%, data released by the ONS on Tuesday showed. How quickly are prices rising? In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics. The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK. \"We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,\" he said. \"Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise\". He added that another side-effect of Trump's trade war is hitting global growth, which causes oil prices to fall, which will feed through to lower petrol prices here in the UK. Sonja Skelton says the biggest cost for her business is staffing - and that's about to get higher with minimum wage increases. The recent increase in National Insurance has cost her over Â£60,000. \"And it's getting higher and higher,\" she says, but she adds she's happy to pay as she says it will help to improve the UK's infrastructure. Her firm, West Special Fasteners, makes nuts and bolts, and has been doing since 1999.  The firm has over 65 employees and supplies offshore defence and specialist construction firms with non-standard fasteners, made with stainless steel and exotic metals. \"We're trying to be a little bit more efficient, so we're trying to improve all our processes, because that can help claw some of that money back.\" But, she adds, if she isn't able to absorb extra costs, the prices of her products will have to go up. \"So there's a specialist material we call that's called Hastelloy C-276. I'd probably say around five years ago, that might have been, say, Â£30 per kilo. \"We're now looking at around about Â£50 per kilo. So, as you can tell, it's a massive, massive increase\". As her firm is a high energy user, the rising cost of energy has also \"really impacted\" her. On top of that, she says that working in engineering, \"you always have ups and downs, because it really depends what's happening all over the world, and conflicts can have a knock-on effect on what we do\". As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%. Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month. But the Bank faces a dilemma, as wage growth remains strong and this would normally discourage a cut in rates. Experts and analysts predict inflation to fall to near its 2% target by 2026. The drop in inflation will be welcome news to the government, said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter. \"With the jobs market weakening somewhat, and very real and present tariff threats still in play, any downward pressure on inflation will be hailed,\" she said. She added the forecast for inflation \"remains very uncertain\" because of a \"volatile\" global economy, and rising National Insurance which she said will raise prices from April onwards. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the drop was \"encouraging\" but that \"there is more to be done. \"I know many families are still struggling with the cost of living and this is an anxious time because of a changing world,\" she said. However, shadow chancellor Mel Stride says Reeves' \"reckless union payouts, tax hikes and borrowing binge is driving up the cost of living\". He said inflation remains above the official target of 2% due to her choices. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said \"those already struggling with the sky-high cost of living simply won't be able to withstand another hammer blow to their pockets, such as from President Trump's global trade war\". She urged the government to make trade deals with European and Commonwealth allies. Additional reporting by Adam Woods. Why are prices rising in the UK?

        "title": "Bangladesh disappeared: Uncovering a secret jail next to an international airport",
        "content": "His memories uncovered a secret jail - right next to an international airport When investigators smashed through a hastily built wall, they uncovered a set of secret jail cells. It turned out to be a freshly bricked-up doorway â an attempt to hide what lurked behind. Inside, off a narrow hallway, were tiny rooms to the right and left. It was pitch-black. The team may never have found this clandestine jail â a stone's throw from Dhaka's International Airport â without the recollections of Mir Ahmad Bin Quasem and others. A critic of Bangladesh's ousted leader, he was held there for eight years. He was blindfolded for much of his time in the prison, so he leaned on the sounds he could recall - and he distinctly remembered the sound of planes landing. That was what helped lead investigators to the military base near the airport. Behind the main building on the compound, they found the smaller, heavily guarded, windowless structure made of brick and concrete where detainees were kept. It was hidden in plain sight. The doorway had been bricked up to hide what lay behind Investigators have spoken to hundreds of victims like Quasem since mass protests toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed's government last August, and inmates in the jails were released. Many others are alleged to have been killed unlawfully. The people running the secret prisons, including the one over the road from Dhaka airport, were largely from an elite counter-terrorism unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), acting on orders directly from Hasina, investigators say. \"The officers concerned [said] all the enforced disappearance cases have been done with the approval, permission or order by the prime minister herself,\" Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor for the International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh, told the BBC. Hasina's party says the alleged crimes were carried out without its knowledge, that it bears no responsibility and that the military establishment operated alone - a charge the army rejects. Seven months on, Quasem and others may have been released, but they remain terrified of their captors, who are serving security force members and are all still free. Quasem says he never leaves home without wearing a hat and mask. \"I always have to watch my back when I'm travelling.\" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC get access to secret jail in Bangladesh He slowly walks up a flight of concrete steps to show the BBC where he was kept. Pushing through a heavy metal door, he bends his head low and goes through another narrow doorway into \"his\" room, the cell where he was held for eight years. \"It felt like being buried alive, being totally cut off from the outside world,\" he tells the BBC. There were no windows and no doors to natural light. When he was inside, he couldn't tell between day or night. Quasem, a lawyer in his 40s, has done interviews before but this is the first time he has taken the media for a detailed look inside the tiny cell where he was held. Viewed by torchlight, it is so small an average-sized person would have difficulty standing up straight. It smells musty. Some of the walls are broken and bits of brick and concrete lie strewn on the ground - a last-ditch attempt by perpetrators to destroy any evidence of their crimes. \"[This] is one detention centre. We have found that more than 500, 600, 700 cells are there all through the country. This shows that this was widespread and systematic,\" says Islam, the prosecutor, who accompanied the BBC on the visit to the jail. Quasem also clearly remembers the faint blue tiles from his cell, now lying in pieces on the floor, which led investigators to this particular room. In comparison to the cells on the ground floor, this one is much larger, at 10ft x 14ft (3m x 4.3m). There is a squatting toilet off to one side. Some of the cells are too tiny to stretch out or stand up in  'The howls were terrifying': Imprisoned in the notorious 'House of Mirrors' Her aunt's regime 'disappeared' people - so why did Starmer make her a minister? In painful detail, Quasem walks around the room, describing how he spent his time during his years in captivity. During the summers, it was unbearably hot. He would crouch on the floor and put his face as close to the base of the doorway as he could, to get some air. \"It felt worse than death,\" he says. Coming back to relive his punishment seems cruel. But Quasem believes it is important for the world to see what was done. \"The high officials, the top brass who aided and abetted, facilitated the fascist regime are still in their position,\" he says. \"We need to get our story out, and do whatever we can to ensure justice for those who didn't return, and to help those who are surviving to rehabilitate into life.\" Previous reports said he was kept inside a notorious detention facility - known as Aynaghor, or \"House of Mirrors\", external - inside the main intelligence headquarters in Dhaka, but investigators now believe there were many such sites. Quasem told the BBC he spent all his detention at the RAB base, apart from the first 16 days. Investigators now suspect the first site was a detective branch of police in Dhaka.  He believes he was disappeared because of his family's politics. In 2016 he'd been representing his father, a senior member of the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, who was on trial and later hanged. Atikur Rahman Rasel lives with family now, but still has physical scars from his ordeal Five other men the BBC spoke to described being taken away, blindfolded and handcuffed, kept in dark concrete cells with no access to the outside world. In many cases they say they were beaten and tortured. While the BBC cannot independently verify their stories, almost all say they are petrified that one day, they might bump into a captor on the street or on a bus. \"Now, whenever I get into a car or I'm alone at home, I feel scared thinking about where I was,\" Atikur Rahman Rasel, 35, says. \"I wonder how I survived, whether I was really supposed to survive. He says his nose was broken and his hand is still painful. \"They put handcuffs on me and beat me a lot.\"  Huge crowds stormed the palace of former prime minister Sheikh Hasin on 5 August 2024, as her 15-year rule ended with her fleeing after weeks of deadly anti-government protests Rasel says he was approached by a group of men outside a mosque in Dhaka's old city last July, as anti-government protests raged. They said they were from law enforcement and he had to go with them. The next minute, he was taken into a grey car, handcuffed, hooded and blindfolded. Forty minutes later, he was pulled out of the car, taken into a building and put in a room. \"After about half an hour, people started coming in one by one and asking questions. Who are you? What do you do?\" Then the beatings started, he says. \"Being inside that place was terrifying. I felt like I would never get out.\" Rasel now lives with his sister and her husband. Sitting on a dining chair in her flat in Dhaka, he describes his weeks in captivity in detail. He speaks with little emotion, seemingly detached from his experience. He too believes his detention was politically motivated because he was a student leader with the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), of which his father was a senior member. His brother, who lived abroad, would frequently write social media posts critical of Hasina. Rasel says there was no way of knowing where he was held. But after watching interim leader Muhammad Yunus visiting three detention centres earlier this year, he thinks he was kept in Agargaon district in Dhaka. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus (second from left) was shown a \"torture chair\" at the army intelligence facility in Dhaka in February Hasina ruled Bangladesh with an increasingly iron fist during 15 years in power It was an open secret that Hasina had no tolerance for political dissent. Criticising her could get you \"disappeared\" without a trace, former detainees, opponents and investigators say. But the total number of people who went missing may never become clear. A Bangladeshi NGO that has tracked enforced disappearances since 2009 has documented at least 709 people who were forcibly disappeared. Among them, 155 people remain missing. Since the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances was created in September, they have received more than 1,676 complaints from alleged victims and more people continue to come forward. But that doesn't represent the total number, which is believed to be much higher. It is through speaking to people like Quasem that Tajul Islam is able to build a case against those responsible for the detention centres, including Sheikh Hasina. Despite being held at different sites, the narrative of victims is eerily similar. Mohammad Ali Arafat, spokesperson for Hasina's Awami League party, denies any involvement. He says if people were forcibly disappeared, it was not done under the direction of Hasina  - who remains in India, where she fled - or anyone in her cabinet. \"If any such detention did occur, it would have been a product of complex internal military dynamics,\"  said Arafat. \"I see [no] political benefit for the Awami League or for the government to keep these people in secret detention.\" The military's chief spokesman said it \"has no knowledge of the things being implied\". \"The army categorically denies operating any such detention centres,\" Lt Col Abdullah Ibn Zaid told the BBC.  Most of the secret sites were run by the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), investigators say Tajul Islam believes the people held in these prisons are evidence of Awami League involvement. \"All the people who were detained here were from different political identities and they just raised their voice against the previous regime, the government of that time, and that is why they were brought here.\" To date they have issued 122 arrest warrants, but no one has yet been brought to justice. Which is why victims like Iqbal Chowdhury, 71, believe their lives are still in danger. Chowdhury wants to leave Bangladesh. For years after he was released in 2019, he didn't leave his house, not even to go to the market. Chowdhury was warned by his captors never to speak of his detention. \"If you ever reveal where you were or what happened, and if you are taken again, no one will ever find or see you again. You will be vanished from this world,\" he says he was told. Accused of writing propaganda against India and the Awami League, Chowdhury says that is why he was tortured. \"I was physically assaulted with an electric shock as well as being beaten. Now one of my fingers is heavily damaged by the electric shock. I lost my leg's strength, lost physical strength.\" He remembers the sound of others being physically tortured, grown men howling and crying in agony. \"I am still scared,\" says Chowdhury. Rahmatullah: They kept me in a place \"where a human being should not even be\"  Rahmatullah, 23, is also terrified. \"They took away a year and a half of my life. Those times won't ever be returned,\" he says. \"They made me sleep in a place where a human being should not even be.\" On 29 August 2023, he was taken from his home at midnight by RAB officers, some in uniform and others dressed in plain clothes. He was working as a cook in a neighbouring town while training to be an electrician. After repeated interrogations, it became clear to Rahmatullah he was being forcibly detained for his anti-India and Islamic posts on social media. Using a pen and paper, he draws the layout of his cell, including the open drain he would use to relieve himself. \"Even thinking about that place in Dhaka makes me feel horrible. There was no space to lie down properly, so I had to sleep being curled up. I couldn't stretch my legs while lying down.\"  ... his sketch shows the layout of his cell The BBC also interviewed two other former detainees â Michael Chakma and Masrur Anwar â to corroborate some of the details about the secret prisons and what is alleged to have gone on inside them. Some of the victims live with physical scars from their detentions. All of them talk about the psychological torment that follows them everywhere they go. Bangladesh is at a pivotal moment in its history as it tries to rebuild after years of autocratic rule. A crucial test of the country's progress towards democracy will be its ability to hold a fair trial for the perpetrators of these crimes. Islam believes it can, and must happen. \"We must stop the recurrence of this type of offence for our future generations. And we have to do justice for the victims. They suffered a lot.\" Standing in what remains of his concrete cell, Quasem says a trial must take place as soon as possible so the country can close this chapter. It's not so simple for Rahmatullah. \"The fear has not gone away. The fear will remain until I die.\" Copyright Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "title": "Nvidia expects $5.5bn hit as US tightens chip export rules to China",
        "content": "Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia Shares in Nvidia plunged on Wednesday after the computer chip giant said it would be hit by $5.5bn (Â£4.2bn) in costs due to the US government tightening its export rules to China. The firm, which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, which has been one of its most popular. The rules come as part of an escalating trade war between the US and China, with both countries introducing steep trade tariffs on each other covering various goods. Nvidia shares fell almost 7% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq exchange it is listed on ended the day down 3.1%. The company announced on Tuesday that the US government had told it last week that the H20 chip required a permit to be sold to China, including Hong Kong.  The tech giant said federal officials had advised them the licence requirement \"will be in effect for the indefinite future\". \"The [government] indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China,\" Nvidia said. The company declined to comment further when contacted by the BBC. Marc Einstein from the Counterpoint Research consultancy said the $5.5bn hit estimated by Nvidia was in line with his estimates. But he said \"while this is certainly a lot of money, this is something Nvidia can bear\". \"As we have seen in the last few days and weeks, this may largely be a negotiating tactic. I wouldn't be surprised to see some exemptions or changes made to tariff policy in the near future, given this not only impacts Nvidia but the entire US semiconductor ecosystem,\" Mr Einstein added. Chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect. Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of US export controls. Founded in 1993, it was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games. Long before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning. It is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world. The company's value took a hit in January when it was reported that a rival Chinese AI app, DeepSeek, had been built at a fraction of the cost of other chatbots. At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off guard by their rival's technological achievement. Nvidia said its $5.5bn charges would be associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves. Rui Ma, founder of the Tech Buzz China podcast, said she expects the US and China AI semiconductor supply chains to be \"fully decoupled\" if restrictions stay in place. She added: \"It doesn't make any sense for any Chinese customer to be dependent on US chips\" especially since there is an oversupply of data centres in China.

        "title": "Disposable vape use falling in UK ahead of government ban",
        "content": "Disposable vapes will no longer be available for sale after 1 June 2025 due to a government ban in the UK The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban, external on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say. But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban â instead of giving up. As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth. Refillable vapes (top) differ from single use vapes (bottom) as they can be recharged and refilled with vape liquid. The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.  The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm. GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.  \"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said. \"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\" The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced. The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over. Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%. In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%. After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds. The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device. Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether. \"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds. Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term. A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged. How are the vaping rules changing? Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models. \"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says. While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\". \"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says. \"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.

        "title": "Supreme Court to announce ruling on definition of a woman",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch Lord Hodge give Supreme Court ruling Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.  It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales. The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.  Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change? The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain. Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.  He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. \"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\" He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".  The Supreme Court case follows years of legal arguments over the definition of a woman under the law  Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears. The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\". Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act. The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\". For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\". Campaigners gathered outside the Supreme Court for the verdict Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex. \"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\" First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement. He posted on social media, external: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.  \"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\" Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"  A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.  A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\". \"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling, external as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".  She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\" Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\" But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society. \"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\" Author JK Rowling has been a vocal supporter of For Women Scotland's case For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups. Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender. Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\". They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.  \"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\" The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room. NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.  The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\". They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian. The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".  It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions. The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces. The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\" The legal case has come at a time of heated debate on gender issues Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender. However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\". Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman. He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex. But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.  He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\" Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.  The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts. Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\". The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex. The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers. What is at stake in the Supreme Court gender case?

        "title": "What to know about Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man Trump officials deported",
        "content": "Democrats and others have pushed for the Trump administration to bring Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a home - while a judge has ordered the government to \"facilitate\" his return A Maryland judge is demanding the return of a man who President Donald Trump's administration has acknowledged was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison.  Last month, the Trump administration sent Kilmar Ãbrego GarcÃ­a to a notorious mega-jail in the Central American country along with more than 260 Venezuelans and Salvadorans, who officials were gang members. He was then moved to another prison in the country which has better conditions, according to Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who met Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a. The Supreme Court last week partially backed Judge Paula Xinis's order requiring officials to \"facilitate\" the Salvadoran national's release, after the government conceded his deportation was an \"administrative error\".  Trump officials have continued to push back against the order, and El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele said this week he would not let Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a return to the US.  Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, 29, came to the US from El Salvador illegally around 2011.  In 2019, he was arrested with three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities.  An immigration judge granted him protection from deportation on the grounds that he might be at risk of persecution from gangs in his home country. Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a was living with his wife and child under this protected legal status in Maryland until he was deported on 15 March.  In 2021 his US citizen wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a restraining order against her husband, alleging he punched and scratched her and ripped off her shirt. But she has told US media the couple resolved the situation, including by counselling. This video can not be played Watch: 'I miss you so much', says wife of Salvadoran deported by mistake The Trump administration has said Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\", but they have also alleged he has ties to the MS-13 gang, a group it designates as a foreign terrorist organisation. Judge Xinis has said Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a has no criminal record in the US or El Salvador, and has called the gang ties \"a singular unsubstantiated allegation\".  She is requesting daily updates from the government on what steps they are taking to bring him back to the US from El Salvador.  On Thursday, yet another court ruled against an appeal from the Trump administration. In its judgement, the three-judge 4th Circuit Court of Appeals panel said the government was \"asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order\". Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a has not been charged with gang activities.  Visiting Trump on Monday, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally, claimed he did not have the power to return Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a. Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador to meet Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a and advocate for his release. He said Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a had been moved from Cecot (Terrorism Confinement Centre) - where he was kept in a cell with 25 other inmates - to a new prison with better conditions in Santa Ana, El Salvador. His time in Cecot left him \"traumatised\", according to Van Hollen. The Trump administration alleges that Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a is a \"verified\" member of the violent El Salvador gang MS-13.  Mr Ãbrego Garcia was arrested outside a Home Depot in Maryland while looking for work in 2019. The allegations against him cited by the Trump administration appear to stem from two documents that were filed by the government during that case.  Officials argued that Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a was a member of an MS-13 gang in New York based on his clothes - which included Chicago Bulls merchandise - and the word of an unknown informant.  His attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg rebuffed those claims and has questioned how Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a's clothes could prove gang affiliation. The lawyer has also cast doubt on the reliability of the unidentified informant. He said Mr Ãbrego GarcÃ­a has not lived in New York.  On Wednesday, White House press secretary said the El Salvador national was wearing \"a sweatshirt with rolls of money covering the ears, mouth and eyes of presidents\", which she said is a \"known MS-13 gang symbol\".  She said he was arrested alongside two other members of the gang, and that \"two separate judges found Ãbrego GarcÃ­a was a member of MS-13\".

        "title": "Obama calls Trump administration's freeze on Harvard funding 'unlawful'",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: 'It's not right' - Students react to Trump freezing Harvard's federal funding Former President Barack Obama is applauding Harvard University's decision to refuse the White House's demands that it change its policies or lose federal money, in his first social media post to criticise the Trump administration since at least Inauguration Day. President Donald Trump is freezing more than $2bn (Â£1.5bn) in federal funds for Harvard because it would not make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices that his administration said were key to fighting antisemitism on campus. Obama, a Harvard alum, described the freeze as \"unlawful and ham-handed\". He called on other institutions to follow Harvard's lead in not conceding to Trump's demands. \"Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions â rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect,\" Obama wrote on social media.  The former president, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, has rarely criticised or rebuked government officials or government policies on social media since leaving the White House almost a decade ago. His posts during the election typically extolled Trump's challenger, then-Vice-President Kamala Harris, and since Inauguration Day, he has mainly posted tributes, personal messages and thoughts on sports. Obama is one of a handful of US political figures and university officials now speaking out against the Trump administration's attempts to reshape the country's top universities, through pressure to change what they teach and who they hire and threats to cut research funding. Hundreds of faculty members at Yale University published a letter expressing their support for Harvard's decision to reject the Trump administration's demands.  \"We stand together at a crossroads,\" the letter read. \"American universities are facing extraordinary attacks that threaten the bedrock principles of a democratic society, including rights of free expression, association, and academic freedom. We write as one faculty, to ask you to stand with us now.\" Many US universities receive some type of federal funding which is mostly designated for scientific research in areas such as drug development. Since Trump returned to office in January, elite institutions such as Stanford University have had to freeze hiring and cut budgets in the face of shrinking federal funds.  Some of the funding has been paused to press universities to take steps that the Trump administration says will fight antisemitism. Trump has accused them of failing to protect Jewish students during last year's campus protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel. Stanford President Jonathan Levin and Provost Jenny Martinez on Tuesday said in a statement praising Harvard that \"universities need to address legitimate criticisms with humility and openness\".  \"But the way to bring about constructive change is not by destroying the nation's capacity for scientific research, or through the government taking command of a private institution,\" they wrote. Columbia University agrees to Trump demand for mask ban Trump pulls $400m from Columbia University Why has Trump revoked hundreds of international student visas? While Columbia University ceded to some of Trump's demands earlier this month, Harvard became the first major US university to take the opposite approach. \"No government â regardless of which party is in power â should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said in a statement on Monday. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) followed Harvard's lead on Monday and also rejected the Trump administration's demands.  Despite the criticism, Trump is standing fast. On Tuesday he took another strike against Harvard, threatening to revoke its tax-exempt status. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempted from paying federal income taxes. This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes.

        "content": "Vandals have destroyed a block of toilets which were being used by employees and visitors of an owl sanctuary in Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent. The incident took place at the sanctuary, in Festival Park, on 4 April and it was then attacked a second time a few days later.  All of the toilets and mirrors were smashed with water leaking throughout the night rendering it unsafe to use. The sanctuary said the toilet block was irreparable and will cost about Â£10,000 to be replaced.  This video can not be played Watch: 'Disgusting' vandalism of owl sanctuary Patricia Webb, co-owner of the sanctuary, said the shelter's employees saw the initial damage to the toilet block when they arrived to work on 5 April.              A few days later the facility had been \"smashed to the ground\" and \"they had smashed the window and destroyed the disabled toilet,\" she said. She added there was no damage to the owl sanctuary and no birds were harmed.  \"They destroyed the baby changing facilities, the mirrors and sinks.\"  As a result of the damage, the sanctuary has had to cancel its school trips.  \"We've been so overwhelmed by the comments and people offering to help like plumbers and electricians,\" she said.  The facilities were used by sanctuary employees as well as visitors The toilets were used by employees and visitors after being loaned to the sanctuary following the closure of the nearby Festival Park shopping centre. The closure has meant the sanctuary's other owner, who is 86, has been unable to visit. \"You can't expect an 86-year-old to go the whole day without using the toilet,\" said Ms Webb. Staff are hoping to raise money to replace the toilet partially supported by a crowdfunding campaign. Ms Webb said the damage will cost about Â£10,000 to repair which will have to be covered by the sanctuary. It comes just months after the sanctuary set up a separate crowdfund to improve the CCTV cameras at the facility following a break-in. Two eagles were shot dead at the sanctuary in 2017 in an attack the owners called \"absolutely mindless\".  Gwent Police said there have been three separate reports of criminal damage at the sanctuary since 4 April. Inspector Rich Tovey said the \"mindless acts of vandalism\" have had a negative impact on the community. He added: \"We are keen to hear from anyone who has information about any of these three reports to contact us and we will take action against those found to be responsible for this anti-social behaviour.\" Arrest made after gravestone vandal rampage Christmas vandals smash windows and throw paint Two eagles shot dead in sanctuary Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Hamas rejects Israeli truce disarmament proposal - official",
        "content": "Armed members of Hamas's military wing took part in hostage handover ceremonies during the recent ceasefire Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds. It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza. A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell. A UN agency meanwhile warned that \"the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities\". It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date. UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law. Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March. At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: \"Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive.\" Conditions at Gaza hospitals 'beyond description' after Israeli attacks, WHO says Israeli air strike destroys part of last fully functional hospital in Gaza City Israel says it will expand its offensive across most of Gaza Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington. A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo. The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: \"The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety.\" It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group. The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war. It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive. On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had \"lost contact\" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as \"a direct strike on their location\". Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held. Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government. In Israel, polls suggest a majority of Israelis back a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released. The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering. Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: \"We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great.\" \"We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,\" the official went on. \"They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them.\" Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held \"under fire\". Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says. A Kuwaiti field hospital in southern Gaza said a security guard was killed by an Israeli strike at its northern gate on Tuesday On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC. The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged. Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him. The IDF said in a statement that it \"struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander\" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence. It also said a \"precise munition\" was used to mitigate harm in the area. The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, AntÃ³nio Guterres, said he was \"deeply alarmed\" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said. Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as \"a command-and-control centre\" - something the group denied. Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted. The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients. \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" the spokesman for Guterres said. He added that the attack dealt \"a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip\", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water. The UN says almost 400,000 Palestinians have been displaced again since Israel resumed its offensive almost four weeks ago The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population. Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population. The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in \"no-go\" zones,\" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements. In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities. However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war. Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage. It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting. In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities. There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement. This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers.

        "title": "CBEX accounts in Nigeria: People fear savings lost as investment app freezes them out",
        "content": "Investors were attracted by the promise of high interest rates Angry Nigerians are turning to social media to describe how they have been locked out of their accounts on the digital financial platform, CBEX. People have posted videos of themselves crying, saying that they could not withdraw their investments and worried that their money had gone. Some furious customers ransacked a CBEX office in the south-west city of Ibadan, carting off chairs, air-conditioners and a solar panel. CBEX has not yet publicly commented. The company had promised that investors would double their money every month. Nigeria is currently facing straitened economic times and many are desperate to find a way to boost their income. One investor, identified as Ola, told BBC Pidgin that he feared he had lost 450,000 naira ($280; Â£210). \"I was ready to withdraw all my investment just last week but my friend told me to be patient and wait - and now it has crashed,\" Ola said. Many others have shared similar stories online, with one person talking about losing $16,000.   The problem was first noticed over the weekend, but the anger boiled over when Monday came and people were still not able to access their money. Some investors who made complaints on the private messaging service Telegram  received responses from CBEX. They were told that the problem was the result of a hack and things will be resolved soon. Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (Sec), which regulates the investment secotr, has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment. But Sec has previously warned citizens about the risks surrounding unregulated digital platforms and potential Ponzi schemes. For some, the situation brings back painful memories from 2016 when another popular financial scheme, called MMM, froze its transactions, leaving many investors heartbroken. Members were supposed to receive a 30% return on their investment in just 30 days. It launched in Nigeria in November 2015 and according to its founders, had up to three million members before it collapsed.

        "title": "Inverness girl completes all Scotland's Munros for a second time",
        "content": "Quinn Young first completed all the Munros when she was just 10 A 12-year-old girl  who previously became one of the youngest people ever to scale all 282 of Scotland's Munros has completed them for a second time. Quinn Young, from Inverness, finished her first Munro-bagging challenge in October 2022, but now she and her dad Ian have managed the feat again. The duo finished their second round of the peaks measuring more than 3,000ft (914m) on Saturday, as they topped the famed Inaccessible Pinnacle on Skye's Cuillin Ridge.  Quinn told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: \"It was sometimes difficult  but not all the time. Sometimes the weather was really bad.\" The father and daughter started out their climbing as \"just an adventure\" Her dad Ian added: \"It was just an adventure that kind of started, I don't even know how.  \"We did our local one near Inverness, Ben Wyvis, and then decided just before she was five to do Ben Nevis on a lovely sunny day. \"The thought was we would just do Ben Nevis every year before we just thought we would go and do some of the other ones.  \"It just kind of took off from there.\" Quinn's second round of Munro bagging took about two years Quinn said her favourite Munros were Skye's Inaccessible Pinnacle, Aonach Eagach or the Curved Ridge, both in Glencoe, as she enjoys scrambling. Ian said he was \"unbelievably proud\" of his daughter's achievement. He added: \"It's just great spending time together. There's no technology, it's fresh air - it's an adventure. \"I hope it is something that she carries on doing - it hopefully can inspire other kids to get in the outdoors and see what Scotland has to offer.\" Quinn said she enjoyed scrambling up the climbs Last time round, Quinn wanted to complete all 282 Munros before she finished primary school. Her second attempt has taken about two years.  And what's next for the father and daughter duo? Quinn said they planned to take on Corbetts now, which are Scottish mountains over 2,500 feet (762m) but under 3,000 feet (914m). The weather could sometimes be a challenge during the climbs The phenomenon known as Munro bagging was inspired by Sir Hugh Munro. Munro, whose family were Scottish landowners, was born in London in 1856 and brought up at Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus. While studying in Germany, he climbed in the Alps and continued his interest in climbing when he settled at the family estate in Scotland. Sir Hugh was a founder and president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club which set him the task of listing all the country's hills of 3,000ft (914m) or more.

        "title": "A UK-US deal sounds good but it is all about the detail",
        "content": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with President Donald Trump in February US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\". UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress. \"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added. The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\". Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\". This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods. In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged. Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit. This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs. The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act. However, there is a big problem now. The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".  But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.  The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.  Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.  'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance But the UK is in a different position than other nations.  Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate. The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit. Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about. Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month. The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape. The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation? In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China. The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods. All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China. There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing. Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies. The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away.

        "title": "Architect Antoni Gaudí on path to sainthood, Pope confirms",
        "content": "Antoni GaudÃ­ was the designer of La Sagrada Familia Basilica in Barcelona, Spain (pictured in January 2025) The Vatican has put Spanish architect Antoni GaudÃ­ on the path to sainthood in recognition of his \"heroic virtues\". GaudÃ­ - who has been dubbed by some as \"God's architect\" - is the designer of one of Spain's most famous religious sites and tourist attractions, the unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona. On Monday, the Vatican issued a statement which said Pope Francis had authorised a decree declaring the Catalonia-born architect \"venerable\". That is an early step on the road to a candidate for sainthood being formally canonised by the Catholic Church. The Sagrada Familia basilica is considered Gaudi's most famous work Casa BatllÃ³ is among his other works scattered around Barcelona  It is the latest development in a decades-long campaign to have GaudÃ­, who was a devout Catholic, recognised as a saint. The Archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella, called the news a \"joy\". \"It is a recognition not only of his architectural work but something more important,\" he said, according to AFP news agency. The cardinal continued: \"He is saying you... amid life's difficulties, amid work, amid pain, amid suffering, are destined to be saints.\" The usual formal process for someone to be declared a saint would next involve beatification, one step short of full sainthood. That is a category reserved for martyrs, those deemed to have lived a life of heroic values and candidates who the Church declares to have a saintly reputation.  In the case of GaudÃ­, who died in 1926 after being hit by a tram while walking to church, the Vatican would likely require proof of a miracle that could be attributed to him post-death in order to proceed with beatification. GaudÃ­ was born in 1852 and many of his best known works continue to attract visitors to Barcelona, where much of his legacy is situated. The Sagrada Familia basilica has been under construction since 1883 and remains unfinished. It has been placed on Unesco's World Heritage list, along with some of Gaudi's other works, and was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. Will Gaudi be made a saint?

        "content": "The oak tree was found cut down on 3 April The cutting down of an ancient oak in north London was ordered on health and safety grounds by the pub chain that owns Toby Carvery after it was told the tree was dead. The felled oak, estimated to be about 500 years old, was found by council workers at the edge of Whitewebbs Park in Enfield earlier in April. An emergency tree preservation order has now been imposed on what remains of the tree, which is near a Toby Carvery. The tree, with a girth of 6m (20ft), was a nationally significant pedunculate oak listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory. A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: \"We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met.\" The pub chain spokesperson added: \"This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care.\" Earlier, a Mitchells & Butlers source said the company had \"done the decent thing\" although they apologised to locals who loved the tree. Enfield Council's leader, Ergin Erbil, previously said they were treating the matter as criminal damage and had reported it to the police. The Met Police confirmed it had received a report from the council, but it is understood the force believes there is no evidence of criminality. Police confirmed they had received a report of criminal damage to the tree The spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: \"The tree was cut back after we were advised that it caused a serious health and safety risk. \"Upon further inspection, our specialist arboriculture contractors made the assessment that the split and dead wood posed a serious health and safety risk and advised that the tree was unsafe and should be removed. \"We are grateful to our expert contractors for warning us of this hazard so swiftly, allowing us to act before anyone was harmed.\" A local resident took a picture of a cherry-picker operating at the tree Benny Hawksbee, a member of the Guardians of Whitewebbs group, said \"the tree belonged to Enfield and to our national heritage - I am devastated.   \"We have now placed a legal protection [Tree Preservation Order] on the tree and are looking at ways to help it grow back.\" Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, said the felling of such a \"magnificent\" tree was shocking.  \"Ancient oaks can live up to 1,000 years old and are as precious as our stately homes and castles,\" he said. \"Our nation's green heritage should be valued and protected and we will do everything we can to achieve this.\" There was outrage when the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland was chopped down in 2023 The Woodland Trust's head of campaigning Adam Cormack said: \"This depressing sight is a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place. \"It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for heritage trees like the Whitewebbs Oak is long overdue.\" The trust's Living Legends petition, which aims to secure such status for heritage trees, and which attracted more than 100,000 signatures, was handed in to Downing Street in November, external.  Sycamore Gap tree: The story so far The issue of tree preservation was highlighted after the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in September 2023. There was outrage when the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, was chopped down. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, are accused of causing criminal damage put at more than Â£600,000. The men, who deny the charge, will appear before a jury at a trial starting on 28 April at Newcastle Crown Court.

Emergency services were called to John Street in Worksop at 19:39 BST on Saturday evening. David Howard, 53, was found in the rubble and declared dead at the scene. Nottinghamshire Police said a 43-year-old man had been questioned and then bailed pending further investigation. Officers said the cause of the explosion remained unclear and they were keeping an open mind at this stage in the investigation. Det Ch Insp Ruby Burrow said: \"Whilst we have made an arrest, I want to be really clear that our investigation remains at a very early stage and we are doing everything possible to establish what caused this deeply tragic incident. \"It remains too early to say whether there is a criminal element to this case and would ask that people avoid speculation.\" David Howard, 53, died in the explosion in John Street One terraced house was destroyed and two more partially collapsed in the blast. Eight other properties and 20 cars were damaged by debris, police added. About 50 people from 35 properties were evacuated, and while many have returned, a number are still in temporary accommodation. Part of John Street is still cordoned off while demolition and investigation work continues. One other person was treated for minor injuries, police said, but everyone in the area has been accounted for. Bassetlaw District Council has warned it could be up to two weeks before residents from properties within the remaining cordon can return home. The authority has joined Nottinghamshire County Council and the police in thanking the public for their patience and cooperation in the aftermath of the emergency. The clear-up operation began on Monday with damaged walls being removed On Monday, residents spoke of their shock. Debbie Adams, who lives on the same road, said the explosion shook her house and filled her dining room with dust. She went into the street and saw the house \"totally collapsed\" and neighbours walking in clouds of dust. Piotr Peruki, whose house backs on to the scene, slept in his car and took a day off work due to exhaustion and shock.

        "title": "Lil Nas X in hospital with partial face paralysis",
        "content": "Lil Nas X posted a video from his hospital bed, showing an unsuccessful attempt to smile Rapper and musician Lil Nas X has revealed he is suffering from a sudden partial paralysis of the face. Posting to Instagram from hospital, external, the star told his 10.4 million followers that he has \"lost control\" of the right-hand side of his face. \"This is me doing a full smile right now, by the way,\" he said in a video, as he unsuccessfully tried to grin. \"Bro, I can't even laugh right.\" In a follow-up post, Lil Nas X reassured fans that he was \"OK\" and asked them to \"stop being sad\". \"Shake ur ass for me instead!\" he joked.  In a third post, he wrote: \"I'mma look funny for a lil bit but that's it.\" In the comments section, his fans and celebrity friends expressed their concern. \"Get well baby,\" said actress Taraji P Henson. \"Sending you love,\" wrote Garbage singer Shirley Manson.  Comedian Wanda Sykes added: \"Sometimes your body tells you to sit down somewhere. Rest up.\" The 26-year-old, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, appeared to be in good spirits, despite his condition. In one video, he panned the camera from the left side of his face to the right, joking: \"We normal over here, we get crazy over here!\" The star posted several updates on his condition on social media The star did not disclose the cause of his condition, but fans speculated it could be Bell's Palsy, a nerve condition that causes paralysis to part of the face, or Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, in which a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near the ear, and cause hearing issues such as tinnitus.  Both conditions are usually temporary, and can be triggered by infections or stress. Justin Bieber cancelled several dates on his 2022 world tour after contracting Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.  In a video, he showed fans that he was unable to blink his right eye and, although the symptoms persisted for some time, he recovered fully. Musician and TV presenter Tulisa Contostavlos also has recurring instances of Bell's Palsy, which developed after she suffered nerve damage in a horse riding accident. Speaking in 2020, she said that an attack could last up to seven months if she didn't take steroids within the first 72 hours. Before his hospital visit, Lil Nas X had been promoting his eight-track EP Days Before Dreamboy, which previews the highly anticipated follow-up to his 2021 debut album, Montero. Speaking to Atlanta radio station Hot 107.9 last month, he said the album had had a painful gestation. \"At the top of 2024... I feel like I was very lost and trying to cater to everybody except myself,\" he said.  The Old Town Road rapper said he had started trying to cater to what he thought \"the world wanted from me\" - including the need \"to be outrageous all the time\". \"But it's like, no, sometimes I can just be on my chill [side],\" he added. Speaking at last month's GLAAD Awards, the star added that he'd recently turned down the opportunity to collaborate with Taylor Swift. \"We were working on something,\" he told E! News on the red carpet. \"She offered to let me try a verse on something, but I couldn't catch a vibe for it, so it didn't happen.\" Lil Nas X: I felt like an imposter on tour Is Lil Nas X the defining star of his generation?

        "content": "Barbers in Swindon are being trained to talk to clients about their wellbeing Barbers in a Wiltshire town will be trained to talk to customers about their wellbeing in a bid to improve men's mental health. Swindon Borough Council is asking barbers and men's hairdressers to sign up to its scheme. It will then provide basic training in how to talk to clients about their mental health as well as information on where they can get more support. \"We recognise the unique and trusting relationships barbers often build with their customers,\" said Lydia Jordan, a public health practitioner at the council. \"This initiative aims to transform those spaces into safe and supportive environment.\" She added it will help men and boys \"feel comfortable opening up about their emotional wellbeing\" while getting their haircut. More news stories for Wiltshire Listen to the latest news for Wiltshire Danny Hegarty, a barber at Supreme Barbers in Swindon, has signed himself and his three colleagues up for the training. \"Men's mental health is such a massive thing,\" he said. \"Even now sometimes men do speak openly to us about their lives, home or work or family while we're cutting their hair.\" He said he wants customers to trust him and his team with their emotions, as well as their haircuts. \"I really feel that a barbershop should be somewhere men can come, and it can be a safe place where they are comfortable talking to people,\" he added. The training will be delivered by the council's public health team and partners at Swindon and Gloucestershire Mind and Papyrus UK, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Ms Jordan said the scheme would have a significant positive impact in the town, with only a short training session required for those who sign up. \"The training won't be onerous or take much time â it will just equip barbers to recognise how to speak about mental health, the right language to use and how to point their customers to more support,\" she said. There will also be stickers on barbershop mirrors with a QR code that will take people to a website with more information. Ms Jordan added: \"The goal is to break down the stigma surrounding boys' and men's mental health.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Wiltshire Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "title": "UK jobs market weakens as employment costs grow",
        "content": "Job vacancies have fallen to the lowest level in nearly four years, suggesting demand for workers is weakening as employment costs grow. The number of jobs on offer fell to 781,000 in the first three months of the year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, while payroll numbers also declined.  Average UK pay continued to rise - up 5.9% - but increases in employer National Insurance Contributions as well as National Minimum Wage hikes which came into force this month are forecast to weigh on salaries.    \"The looming hike in employers' taxes in April is very likely to have persuaded employers to hold back on hiring,\" said Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown. Employment Minister Alison McGovern welcomed a continuing rise in real wages and said April's changes would boost \"people's payslips and improving living standards\".  However, the number of workers on payrolls dropped by 78,000 in March and were revised down for the previous month.  Ms Coles said that pausing hiring \"is the simplest lever for businesses to pull when they want to slow things down. It's far cheaper and damaging than letting people go, so may be a sign of things to come\".  The ONS said the UK unemployment rate remained at 4.4%, roughly the same as the previous three months. The employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 years was 75.1%, still below Labour's target of 80% employment. However, the ONS has said its jobs figures should be treated with caution because of low response rates to its employment survey, on which the figures are based. While wage growth remains strong, some economists are predicting this will not last.  Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \"The short-term impact of the rise in labour costs which came into effect in April, will likely put downward pressure on pay over the coming months.\" Meanwhile, recruitment firm Manpower said the whole picture of the labour market will not be fully understood for some time as the effect of Donald Trump's tariffs spreads.   \"We're seeing much broader scale cutbacks than we'd previously anticipated as higher costs coincide with the Trump-led tariffs and British Steel negotiations, all adding to a greater sense of uncertainty for businesses,\" said Anna Spaul, market intelligence director at ManpowerGroup. The strength in wage growth contrasted with signs of weakness in hiring illustrates the dilemma facing the Bank of England and interest rates which are currently at 4.5%. Wage growth could delay further rate cuts but the Bank may act to stimulate the economy following the implementation of tariffs in the UK and globally. The Bank will hold its next interest rate-setting meeting in May.  More than a fifth of UK adults still not looking for work Who are the millions of Britons not working?

        "content": "The taxi driver was confronted in this lay-by in Twyford Road near Willington A taxi driver has been sacked after video footage posted online appeared to show him fly-tipping in a lay-by in Derbyshire. The incident, which was recorded at about 15:40 BST on 8 April, shows a man confronting the driver and telling him to put broken paving slabs back in his taxi in Twyford Road near Willington. His employer, Derby-based Western Cars, said the driver was immediately suspended and was now no longer working under the brand following an investigation.  The driver is licensed by Derby City Council, which said it was investigating the matter. South Derbyshire District Council did not respond when asked to comment. The video posted online shows footage of a Western Cars-branded taxi parked up in the lay-by and with the driver confronted by the man filming it. The driver denies putting the broken paving slabs under the hedgerow but the footage appears to show more paving slabs in the boot of his taxi.  Western Cars said it suspended the driver on 9 April pending an investigation and also notified local authorities about the video. The firm added it found the fly-tipping site had been cleared when it visited the following day. \"Following our internal review process, the driver in question is no longer affiliated with Western Cars,\" the company said in a Facebook post on Monday. \"Our drivers operate as self-employed contractors, whilst representing our brand, and we uphold clear standards regarding professional conduct across our operation. \"We understand that the relevant local authorities are conducting their own enquiries into the matter.

        "title": "Vets tell BBC they are under 'consistent pressure' to make money",
        "content": "Vet company IVC told us animal health and welfare was always its first priority Some vets are being put under \"consistent pressure\" to generate income, the BBC has been told. \"Your worth is only how much income you bring,\" says \"Adam\" - a vet at a practice owned by IVC Evidensia (IVC), one of the big six pet-care providers in the UK. He says the amount of money he brings in is one of his key performance indicators. The BBC spoke to seven vets working for IVC, which owns more than 900 surgeries, who all say they are monitored and set targets by the company.  The vets, who wanted to remain anonymous, had responded to a recent survey by the British Veterinary Union (BVU) - the findings of which have been shared exclusively with File on 4 Investigates. Adam says he and his colleagues are being encouraged to compete against other practices owned by IVC over the number of certain procedures they carry out on animals, through what the company calls \"clinical challenge milestones\". IVC told us the health and welfare of animals is always its first priority and that the best interests of pets are of paramount importance.  It says that clinical autonomy is a core tenet of its business and that all the 8,000 vets and vet nurses working for the company have clinical freedom to recommend appropriate care, considering each animal's needs and the owner's circumstances. In 2013, only 10% of vet practices in the UK were owned by large corporate groups. Now that figure stands at 60%. Bills for pet owners have risen as corporate ownership has increased - by more than 60% between 2015 and 2023, figures from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) show. This is almost double the rate of inflation or the increase in vet salaries over that time. The CMA is currently investigating concerns about corporations buying hundreds of independent vet practices, pushing up prices and making potentially excessive profits. It is expected to deliver provisional recommendations in July.  Technological advances and changing expectations of pet owners may also be factors in rising vet bills. All the big six monitor the average amount per animal a vet generates across all their consultations. In emails seen by the BBC, Adam is asked to explain why his \"average transaction value\" is \"very low\" and his use of a certain procedure is also \"very low\". \"The income is the thing by which you are monitored,\" Adam says. \"You start thinking about how much you charge [per consultation]... what you can add.\" Pressure from IVC has resulted in him feeling he needed to upsell to pet owners, he tells us. \"I felt chastised for not bringing [in] enough money.\" A graph charts how your practice compares to your area and the whole of IVC, Adam says. \"Seeing this is already intimidating if you are below the line.\" The BBC has seen emails from IVC to Adam's practice urging vets to carry out a certain number of specific procedures on pets. There are gold, silver and bronze target \"milestones\" to aim for. Staff are told about drop-in sessions where they can share what IVC describes as \"tips and tricks\" with colleagues on how to reach their targets and are told they'll get constant updates on their progress. Whatâs Happening to Your Vet Bills? File on 4 Investigates looks at how the corporatisation of the vet industry has led to price hikes of more than 60% in the last 10 years. IVC has stressed these \"clinical challenge\" targets aren't financial but are designed to improve the clinical care of pets. The selected procedures, it says, are all carefully chosen because they are essential to ensuring a prompt diagnosis and stabilisation of emergency patients. These procedures help identify potential future issues, it adds, enabling preventative action to be taken - which improves patient outcomes, shortens treatment plans, and are therefore more cost effective overall.  The company says challenges were also introduced to ensure care-level consistency across all its practices. IVC - which is owned by a private equity firm - also owns the UK's largest emergency out-of-hours service, called Vets Now.  A vet who works there, says she and her colleagues have been given similar targets, and offered prizes for hitting them. She claims the company's approach sometimes interferes in clinical decisions and makes it harder for vets to propose treatments based on pet owners' budgets. Another vet working for the out-of-hours service told the BBC its call centre regularly booked emergency appointments with her for animals with non-urgent symptoms, costing pet owners more than Â£300. \"I'd say 30% to 50% of cases could wait to be seen in the morning,\" says the vet. The call centre, based in Scotland, is staffed by non-clinical call handlers. Guidance for the handlers, seen by BBC, states they should re-offer emergency appointments if callers appear \"hesitant\", and only offer to put them through to a veterinary nurse or clinic for clinical advice if they \"insist\". As well as owning vet practices and Vets Now, IVC has 24 referral centres handling complex cases A reporter for BBC File on 4 Investigates - pretending that her dog had vomited once or twice - called Vets Now and the two other out-of-hours veterinary services operated by large corporate groups, plus one independent service. Of these, only Vets Now offered an emergency face-to-face appointment to the reporter, with the call handler recommending the dog should be checked in a clinic. The following day, the reporter called back to check the price. She was offered an online consultation after again hesitating about the in-person appointment. The other two corporate services and the independent asked our reporter further questions about her dog and advised she didn't need to go to a surgery. Two veterinary surgeons confirmed to the BBC that a dog vomiting once or twice, with no other worrying symptoms, should not be seen as an emergency. IVC told the BBC that where there is any reasonable doubt about the severity of a pet's condition, seeing it out of hours is the safest way to ensure its welfare. But it says this is ultimately for the customer to decide, which was made clear during the call. One of the Vets Now vets also told us that non-urgent appointments were hampering her ability to treat genuine emergencies. \"We are sometimes overstretched as a result of the sheer number of non-urgent cases,\" she says. As well as owning vet practices and Vets Now, IVC has 24 referral centres handling cases too complex for High Street vets - plus 65 veterinary hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, pet crematoriums and an online pharmacy. A specialist vet working in one of the referral centres told us he had recently been instructed to give price estimates only for the first 24 hours of a poorly pet's care, rather than more realistic long-term estimates. He believes this approach is dishonest and feels that it provides people \"with a lower upfront cost to get them in the door, to then tell them that, 'actually, it's going to be this much more'\". The vet says that, so far, the referral centre has refused to comply, \"but there is pressure being applied\". IVC denies it pressures vets to withhold pricing information. Giving an estimate that exceeds the first 24-hour period is likely to be inaccurate and misleading, it says, given the number of factors that can impact required care. For in-patient care, it says, its vets will initially provide a range and then give daily updates on costs. This improves transparency and accuracy, it adds, enabling customers to make informed decisions. A survey of 275 veterinary staff, carried out by the British Veterinary Union (BVU) for the CMA last year, and now shared exclusively with File on 4 Investigates, indicated that monitoring and targets had an impact on the decisions of almost 40% of nurses and just over 17% of vets. The BVU says the sector has become more profit-driven since non-vets were allowed to take over practices in 1999. One of the vets we spoke to says he believes IVC's main goal is making money for the venture capitalists behind the company. Update 16 April 2025:  After this article was published IVC Evidensia provided a further response to some of the issues raised. In relation to concerns about vets being monitored on the amount of money they bring in per client, the company told us: \"IVC Evidensia never pressures our vets or vet nurses to prioritise revenue, or average transaction value, over appropriate contextualised clinical care.\" In relation to costs estimates, the company told us its vets and vet nurses \"comply with the Code of Professional Conduct set out by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in all things, including on providing estimates for the first 24 hours of emergency or complex care, and daily estimates for each subsequent 24 hour period\".

The work is understood to be made using the skin of William Corder, the man convicted of killing Maria Marten in the Red Barn Murder in 1827, and will go on display alongside a similar item at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Dan Clarke, heritage officer, said the books had an \"incredibly important\" historical value and that he had never had a complaint about the first being on display. However, Terry Deary, author of Horrible Histories, described them as \"sickening artefacts\", adding: \"These are two books I'd like to burn.\"  The first Corder book (right) has been on display for 92 years and is more complete than the second (left) This video can not be played LISTEN: The Suffolk books bound in human skin The story of the 1827 murder in Polstead, Suffolk, shocked Georgian Britain. Since then, it has been the subject of many films, books, plays and folk songs. The most commonly told version is that Corder had been having an affair with Miss Marten. He told her to meet him at the Red Barn, a local landmark, saying they would run away to Ipswich to get married. But Corder shot and killed Miss Marten, burying her in the barn. He was eventually caught and publicly executed on 11 August 1828. His body was dissected and part of his skin was used to bind a book telling the story of his trial. Corder's public hanging in Bury St Edmunds drew a crowd of thousands This book was put on display at the museum in 1933. But recently curators were looking through the museum's catalogue and realised there was a second book that had been overlooked. It had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder's body.  The book was located, not in the museum stores, but on a bookshelf in the office, next to other books bound in more traditional materials. Mr Clarke said: \"We get things called museum losses, and it tends to be from the last century - things that have not been seen for a couple of decades. \"This would be considered a museum loss which has been found.\" Unlike the first Corder book, the skin is only on the book's binding and corners. Covering books in human skin is known as anthropodermic bibliopegy. Books were often created in the 19th Century to punish executed prisoners or by doctors who wanted a keepsake. Terry Deary described the skin-bound books as \"sickening artefacts\" Deary, whose Horrible Histories series have sold millions around the world and been turned into a TV franchise, said Corder had been convicted on circumstantial evidence and suffered terribly as a result. On the museum items, he said: \"I know you're not supposed to burn books but quite honestly these are such sickening artefacts. \"What was worse than the hanging was the thought that their body would be dissected after death, and this is an extension of that.\" In March 2024, Harvard University removed the skin binding from a 19th Century book in its library \"due to the ethically fraught nature of the book's origins and subsequent history\". But staff at Moyse's Hall said that would not happen to either of its books, which are now on display together. Mr Clarke said: \"We see human remains in every museum across the country.\" In his 11 years at the museum, he said, there had not been a single complaint about the first book, but there had been concerns raised about mummified cats being displayed as part of a witchcraft exhibit. Heritage assistant Abbie Smith got to hold the books on her first day in the job and said they felt \"like a real book\". \"If you did not tell people it was bound in human skin, I do not really think you would realise,\" she said. \"It is also rather humbling to have something like that in the collection.\" Do you have a story suggestion for Suffolk?

        "title": "Mohsen Mahdawi: Palestinian student activist arrested at US citizenship interview",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Moment Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi arrested by ICE An organiser of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University has been arrested by immigration officials as he attended an interview as part of his application for US citizenship, his lawyer says. Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who is due to graduate next month from the New York City college, was detained on Monday in Colchester, Vermont. His lawyer said Mr Mahdawi was taken into custody \"in direct retaliation\" for his role in campus demonstrations against the Israel-Gaza war. Others who took part in campus protests against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk, have been detained. The BBC has contacted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for more details on Mr Mahdawi's case. Video shared on social media apparently shows him being escorted into a car by two officers wearing police jackets. His lawyer, Luna Droubi, said: \"The Trump administration detained Mohsen Mahdawi in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian. \"His detention is an attempt to silence those who speak out against the atrocities in Gaza. It is also unconstitutional.\" The attorney applied to a federal court for a temporary restraining order to prevent US immigration authorities moving Mr Mahdawi out of Vermont or expelling him from the US. Judge William Sessions, an Obama appointee, quickly granted that order. The court filing says Mr Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the US in 2014. It describes the philosophy major as a committed Buddhist who believes in \"non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion\". The whereabouts of Mr Mahdawi, who has held US permanent resident status since 2015, are unknown, according to Ms Droubi. Mr Mahdawi participated in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University Mr Mahdawi, who co-founded Columbia's Palestinian Student Society, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's military operation in Gaza. Last December, he did an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes programme in which he accused Israel of genocide, which it denies. Mr Mahdawi's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown by President Donald Trump's administration. Last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at least 300 foreign students' visas had been revoked in an effort to tackle antisemitism on university campuses. Critics say US officials are falsely accusing students of anti-Jewish bigotry and violating their right to free speech. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said on X that Mr Mahdawi \"was illegally detained by ICE during what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process\". The senator said he \"must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention\". Judge Sessions also held a hearing on Monday in the case of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Boston's Tufts University, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month. He questioned whether the Trump administration would provoke a \"constitutional crisis\" by not releasing the student from custody if the court were to order that she be moved from detention in Louisiana back to Vermont. Meanwhile, lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil are currently challenging an immigration judge's ruling on Friday allowing the government to deport him as a national security risk. The Columbia University protest leader was detained last month outside his campus accommodation and transferred to a Louisiana detention centre.

        "title": "Trump blames Zelensky for starting war day after massive Russian attack",
        "content": "The US president's comments follow the deadliest strike on civilians in Ukraine this year - an attack which Trump described as a 'mistake' Donald Trump has again blamed Volodymyr Zelensky for starting the war with Russia â a day after a major Russian attack killed 35 people and injured 117 others in the Ukrainian city of Sumy. The US president said Ukraine's leader shared the blame with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the \"millions of people dead\" in the conflict.  \"You don't start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said at the White House on Monday. His comments followed Russia's strike on Sumy on Sunday - the deadliest attack on civilians this year.  Moscow also hit the city's outskirts on Monday night. This video can not be played BBC visits scene of destruction in Sumy after Russian attack Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte went to Ukraine on Tuesday in a show of solidarity with Kyiv following the missile strikes. Joining Zelensky in Odesa, Rutte condemned the \"terrible pattern\" of attacks on civilians and said \"Russia is the aggressor, Russia started this war, there's no doubt\". Trump on Monday had first described the Sumy attack as \"terrible\" but said he had been told Russia had \"made a mistake\". He did not give further detail. Moscow said it had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them, but did not provide any evidence. Meanwhile, Ukrainian media reported that there had been a medal ceremony for military veterans in the city on the day of the attack. Zelensky sacked Sumy's regional chief on Tuesday, for allegedly hosting the event, local media reported. Trump on Monday also blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for the war's casualties- which are estimated in the hundreds of thousands, not the millions he's claimed. \"Millions of people dead because of three people,\" Trump had said. \"Let's say Putin number one, let's say Biden who had no idea what the hell he was doing, number two, and Zelensky.\" Questioning Zelensky's competence, he said the Ukrainian leader was \"always looking to purchase missiles\". \"When you start a war, you got to know you can win,\" the US president said. Trump has repeatedly blamed Zelensky and Biden for the war, despite Russia invading Ukraine first in 2014, five years before Zelensky won the presidency, and then launching a full-scale invasion in 2022. Trump further argued on Monday that \"Biden could have stopped it and Zelensky could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it. Everybody is to blame\". Tensions between Trump and Zelensky have been high since a heated confrontation at the White House in February, where the US leader chided Ukraine's president for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier. This video can not be played Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump By contrast, Trump has taken action to drastically improve relations with Moscow. Trump's administration has sought to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and has held negotiations with Moscow that have cut out Kyiv. Trump said he had a \"great\" phone call with Putin last month, and the Russian president sent him a portrait as a gift a week later. In February, Washington voted with Moscow against a UN resolution that identified Russia as the \"aggressor\" in Russia's war against Ukraine. After talks between US and Russian officials failed to produce a ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump said he was \"very angry\" with Putin, though he added he had a \"good relationship\" with the Russian leader. Rosenberg: Trump takes US-Russia relations on rollercoaster ride US envoy Steve Witkoff, who met Putin in St Petersburg for close to five hours on Friday, called his meeting \"compelling\". He said the Russian leader's request had been to get \"a permanent peace... beyond a ceasefire\".  The detailed discussions had included the future of five Ukrainian territories Russia is claiming to have annexed since it launched the full-scale invasion of its neighbour and \"no Nato, Article 5\" â referring to the Nato rule that says members will come to the defence of an ally that is under attack. \"I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large,\" Witkoff told Fox News on Monday. \"There is a possibility to reshape the Russian-United States relationship through some very compelling commercial opportunities that I think give real stability to the region, too. Partnerships create stability,\" Trump's envoy said.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was less effusive, describing the contacts as positive but with no clear outlines of an agreement. In an interview recorded before Russia's deadly attack on Sumy, Zelensky had urged Trump to visit Ukraine before striking a deal with Putin to end the war. \"Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead,\" Zelensky said in an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes programme. At least 35 people were killed when Russian forces fired two Iskander missiles into the heart of Sumy on Sunday.  The blasts took place minutes apart while many civilians were heading to church for Palm Sunday, a week before Easter. A bus was destroyed in the attack and bodies were left strewn in the middle of a city street. Ukainian and US officials have asserted that cluster munitions may have been used. No casualties were reproted from Moscow's strike on the outskirts of Sumy on Monday night. Ukraine's military on Tuesday said it had struck a base belonging to the Russian rocket brigade that conducted Sunday's missile attack on Sumy. Russia's conflict in Ukraine goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Kyiv's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.

Māori in New Zealand have been resisting moves by the current right-of-centre government to abolish certain indigenous-specific rights aimed at combatting disadvantage. In a 9-day hikoi or march of defiance they walked from the top of New Zealand down to the capital Wellington, joined by non-Māori supporters - all opposed to the changes.  A separate Māori Health Authority has been dismantled, for example. It was set up by the previous centre-left government to tackle health inequalities that mean indigenous people live seven years less than other New Zealanders. Māori also come bottom in statistics for employment, housing and education, and are highly overrepresented in prison. Most divisive though, a new law proposal about the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi - New Zealand’s founding document, sought to do away with what has been a form of affirmative action, and instead treat everyone the same, regardless of heritage. Some feel this is all necessary to achieve proper equality.

        "content": "More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests. The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years. And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla.  The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.  For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts. Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204. Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023. However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%. It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years. Doug Hepper says saving up has been tough Doug Hepper, 30, from Tewkesbury, is a dad and wants to buy his first home.  But due to the cost of living doing so is almost impossible in the short-term, he said. \"When I grew up, I thought the normal thing was to get married, have kids and buy a house around the time of being 30,\" he added. \"The kid came first but I never thought the buying the house part would be so far out of reach.\" But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched. \"A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,\" she said.  However, she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still \"room for improvement\". Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing to uncertainty created by US tariff policy on the wider economy.

For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender. Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests. Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla. Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction. The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days. Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said. Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark. \"Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla.  \"Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale.\" Zoopla uses a median average figure (the mid-point) for its data. It also discards homes that have been listed for more than six months, as it considers them to be unlikely to sell. Are you a first-time buyer? Have you been finding it difficult to raise a deposit?

        "title": "Supplies to be sent to Scunthorpe to keep blast furnaces going",
        "content": "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds The government has admitted it would \"look at a Chinese firm in a different way\" when considering investment in the steel industry after being forced to seize control British Steel.  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said steel is a \"sensitive sector\" after key raw materials needed to keep the company's blast furnaces running were being transported to its Scunthorpe plant on Tuesday. The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off. Beijing has accused the government of \"politicising trade co-operation\" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK. The government has so far stopped short of taking British Steel back into full public ownership but has not ruled out nationalisation, while also looking for potential private investors to fund operations. But Reynolds said when it came to looking for potential investors: \"I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way\". \"[Steel] is a sensitive sector around the world and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China,\" he added. After its intervention at the weekend, the government then had to scramble to secure the supplies needed to keep Scunthorpe going.  Coking coal and iron ore from the US arrived at Immingham docks on Tuesday to be transported to British Steel's Scunthorpe site. Reynolds said he was \"keen to stress the action we've taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn't acting in the UK's national interest\". Alasdair McDiarmid, assistant general secretary of the union Community, said the arrival was a \"huge relief\". A separate shipment of materials is back on its way to the UK from Australia after a legal dispute over who owned the cargo was resolved between the government and Jingye. If the furnaces were starved of fuel and went out, the UK would no longer have the capability to produce so-called virgin steel, due to the process of restarting them being extremely difficult and costly.  Virgin steel-making involves iron being extracted from its original source to be purified and treated to make all types of steel used in major construction projects, such as new buildings and railways. The materials have been paid for by the government, which industry minister Sarah Jones said are covered by existing budgets.  \"We have a Â£2.5bn fund for steel within the department for business so we won't be drawing down on any extra resources and people can be reassured of that,\" she told the BBC's Today programme. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is said to be in a \"far better position\" as a result of the government's intervention, according to union officials. Asked if the government could guarantee there would be no job cuts at the North Lincolnshire steelworks, Reynolds there may be a \"different employment footprint\". \"That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.\" British Steel has been granted planning permission to build new \"greener\" electric arc furnaces which unions have claimed would lead to job losses. Why did the government take control of British Steel? Ex-Tata workers 'frustrated' by Scunthorpe takeover In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe site was losing Â£700,000 a day, which it said was \"no longer financially sustainable\", and the company began a consultation on job cuts. Talks between officials and Jingye last week failed to produce a breakthrough. The government said the company had rejected an offer of Â£500m in public money to help keep the furnaces operating, and had demanded more than twice as much with few guarantees it would keep the plant open. \"We were working in good faith on what we thought was a good deal on the table,\" said Jones. \"That relationship broke down when, in the middle of a consultation about the future of the site, they refused to buy the raw materials to keep that site going. That was an act of bad faith and that's why we had to intervene in the way that we did.\" Reynolds previously said it \"became clear\" that Jingye was intent on closing down the blast furnaces no matter the financial support offered, prompting the government to secure control of the site.

Harvard became the first major US university to reject his administration's demands on Monday, accusing the White House of trying to \"control\" its community. In a Tuesday morning post on social media, Trump threatened to go beyond withholding the federal funds and targeted Harvard tax-exempt status. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempt from paying federal income taxes. This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes. \"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \"Sickness?\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\" This video can not be played Watch: 'It's not right' - Students react to Trump freezing Harvard's federal funding Losing the exemption could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year.  The Ivy League institution also has a fund of assets, or endowment, valued at $53bn. Later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wanted the university to apologise for what his administration says is continuing tolerance of antisemitism. \"[Trump] wants to see Harvard apologise, and Harvard should apologise,\" Leavitt said.  This video can not be played Watch: White House says Harvard should apologise to Jewish students The sweeping changes demanded by the White House would have transformed Harvard's operations and ceded a large amount of control to the government. Its letter to Harvard on Friday, obtained by the New York Times,, external said the university had failed to live up to the \"intellectual and civil rights conditions\" that justify federal investment. The letter included 10 categories for proposed changes, including: reporting students to the federal government who are \"hostile\" to American values ensuring each academic department is \"viewpoint diverse\" hiring an external government-approved party to audit programmes and departments \"that most fuel antisemitic harassment\" checking faculty staff for plagiarism President Trump has accused leading universities of failing to protect Jewish students when college campuses around the country saw protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel last year. The letter orders the university to take disciplinary action for \"violations\" during protests. In explaining its rejection of these demands, Harvard president Alan Garber said the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights under the First Amendment protecting free speech. \"Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,\" he said. Columbia University agrees to Trump demand for mask ban Trump pulls $400m from Columbia University Why has Trump revoked hundreds of international student visas? Shortly after his letter of resistance was sent, the education department said it was freezing $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts to Harvard immediately. \"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,\" the Department of Education said in a statement. The disruption of learning plaguing campuses is unacceptable and the harassment of Jewish students intolerable, the statement said.  A professor of history at Harvard, David Armitage, told the BBC that the school could afford to resist as the richest university in the US and no price was too high to pay for freedom. \"It's a not unexpected act of entirely groundless and vengeful activity by the Trump administration which wants nothing more than to silence freedom of speech,\" he said. In March, the Trump administration said it was reviewing roughly $256m in federal contracts and grants at Harvard, and an additional $8.7bn in multi-year grant commitments. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, said on X: \"It is time to totally cut off US taxpayer funding to this institution.\"  Harvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom.  Harvard is one of a number of elite universities in the crosshairs of the new presidency.  Columbia University in New York City agreed to a number of demands last month after the White House pulled $400m in federal funding. But on Monday Columbia struck a less compliant tone, releasing its own letter that said it was continuing \"good faith talks\" with the government as it seeks to win back its funding, but also said it would \"reject any agreement that would require us to relinquish our independence\". Polling by Gallup last summer suggested, external that confidence in higher education has been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.

        "title": "Gary Lineker: I felt BBC wanted me to leave Match of the Day",
        "content": "This video can not be played Gary Lineker says 'it's time' to leave MOTD after more than 25 years presenting Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.  The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage. Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\" The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\". However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\". A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January. Gary Lineker has hosted Match of the Day since 1999 but will soon be stepping down Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\" However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.  \"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained. But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.  \"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said. \"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\" Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.  This video can not be played Gary Lineker says no to a politics career when he leaves MOTD Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.  The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.  Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.  \"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense. \"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\" He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\" The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\". The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\". Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.  While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport. Lineker's tweets reignited the row about how the BBC's impartiality guidance applied to presenters' use of social media Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\". \"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\" He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\" Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\". The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets. The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\". Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\" Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC, external to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.  The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\" He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\". \"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said. After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation. The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\". Lineker said football should take a closer look at the ethics of gambling adverts and sponsorship In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports. Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms. \"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said. \"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere. \"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\" On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money. The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.  \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\" Amol Rajan Interviews: Gary Lineker is on BBC iPlayer now and will air on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday.

Noem confirmed during the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday morning that she fell victim to the theft, saying the matter had not been \"resolved yet\".

        "title": "US stocks and dollar slide after Trump attacks Fed chair Powell",
        "content": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates. In a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments.  \"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote. Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.  The president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil. Live coverage of this story The S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January. However, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher. In European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%. Though the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence.  The dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022. Interest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries. Meanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (Â£2,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets. The precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\". \"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.  China warns nations against 'appeasing' US in trade deals No global recession despite US tariffs, says IMF Why everyone is suddenly so interested in US bond markets Trump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs. The latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy. Trump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\" Such a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank. Powell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him.  But one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.  Trump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Christopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time. \"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added. \"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown. The IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\". Mr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues. \"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\" Ms Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\". \"Yields on 10âyear US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.

        "title": "New Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan proposed, Hamas source says",
        "content": "The last ceasefire ended when Israel resumed bombing last month A senior Palestinian official familiar with Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations has told the BBC that Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new formula to end the war in Gaza. According to the official, it envisages a truce lasting between five and seven years, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. A senior Hamas delegation was due to arrive in Cairo for consultations. The last ceasefire collapsed a month ago when Israel resumed bombing Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure to keep it going. Israel has not commented on the mediators' plan. Meanwhile, at least 26 Palestinians were killed and 60 others injured by Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday. Local residents and eyewitnesses described the air strikes as \"extremely intense.\" According to witnesses, the attacks destroyed dozens of bulldozers and heavy machinery - equipment used by Hamas-run municipalities to reopen roads, clear rubble, and rescue victims trapped beneath the debris. In a statement on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck \"approximately 40 engineering vehicles used for terror purposes, including during the October 7th massacre\". \"Hamas has used these vehicles for planting explosives, digging underground routes, breaching fences, and clearing rubble to locate weapons and military equipment hidden by the terrorist organisation beneath the rubble,\" it said. Tanks have also been seen moving in the southern part of Rafah city in the south of Gaza. As Israel pushes on with its offensive, talks were due to take place in Cairo with Hamas represented at a senior level by the head of its political council, Mohammed Darwish, and its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. The meeting comes days after the movement rejected Israel's latest proposal, which included a demand for Hamas to disarm in return for a six-week truce. On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not end the war before Hamas was destroyed and all the hostages returned. Hamas has demanded Israel commit to ending the war before the hostages are freed. The Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Hamas has signalled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon \"at the national and regional level\". The official said this could be the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) or a newly formed administrative body. Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza, which has been ruled by Hamas since 2007. While it is still too early to assess the likelihood of success, the source described the current mediation effort as serious and said Hamas had shown \"unprecedented flexibility\". Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry figures on Monday.  Elsewhere, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo has instructed its staff - who had been co-ordinating medical evacuations from Gaza to Egyptian hospitals and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid - to relocate with their families to the Egyptian city of Arish, near the Gaza border.

        "content": "Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith Over 12 profoundly consequential years for the Catholic Church, Pope Francis steered it into uncharted territory and did so in ways that will resonate long into the future. The pontiff worked to soften the face of the Catholic Church for many, loosened the Vatican's grip on power and intervened in some of the major social questions of our time. Within Catholicism, he certainly had his critics; some traditionalists in particular were often enraged by actions they felt were a radical departure from Church teaching.  Despite him being a vocal pacifist and critic of actions by major nations that he perceived as harmful, there were also those who felt he should have been more progressive. But from the moment he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis came with an informality and a smile that put the people he met at their ease. It was symbolic of a principle that guided his belief that the Church should reach people in their daily lives, wherever in the world they happened to be. \"At the beginning of my papacy I had the feeling that it would be brief: no more than three or four years, I thought,\" Pope Francis said in his autobiography Hope, released in January 2025, a book that gives us insight into the Pope's own reflections on his legacy. One of his first acts as pope was to give up the papal apartment on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, instead choosing to live in the same guesthouse in which he had stayed as a cardinal. Some saw this as a sign he was giving up the ostentatious trappings of papacy, and of the humility he would certainly become known for - he had, after all, taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor. But the main reason for surrendering the papal apartment, as he later explained it, pointed to another of his characteristics: that he loved being around people. To him, the apartment felt detached and a difficult place in which to welcome guests. At the guesthouse he was surrounded by clergy and rarely alone for long. On foreign trips to more than 60 countries, in his audiences at the Vatican and during countless events, it was very clear that being close to people, and particularly the young, was his lifeblood. Pope Francis' influence was felt far and wide Within Catholicism, he signalled a radical change in tone on some social issues. \"Everyone in the Church is invited, including people who are divorced, including people who are homosexual, including people who are transgender,\" he wrote in his autobiography. Given that the Church did not recognise divorce in its canon law and that previous popes had talked of homosexuality as a disorder not \"a human fact\", as Pope Francis did, this was a departure that again concerned traditionalists. But the Pope appeared to want the Church to explore and understand people's every day struggles in a fresh light. He acknowledged his own journey in seeing things differently to the way he had done in the past. LIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88 ANALYSIS: The Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church EXPLAINER: How the next pope is chosen WATCH: The pontiff's last public appearance on Easter Sunday IN PICTURES: Defining images of the first Latin American pope Progressives welcomed the Pope's compassion for what he called \"imperfect Catholics\", but there was also a recognition more broadly that words of acceptance from a pontiff could have an effect on those outside the Church too. \"The first time that a group of transgender people came to the Vatican, they left in tears, moved because I had taken their hands, had kissed them... as if I had done something exceptional for them! But they are daughters of God,\" he wrote in Hope. Pope Francis roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime, and he talked of divorce sometimes being \"morally necessary\", citing cases of domestic abuse. However, there are those who suggest the Pope could have gone further to encourage change in Church teaching. Homosexual \"acts\" remain a sin in Catholicism, marriage can still only be between a man and a woman, divorce is still not officially recognised and the Pope himself remained very firmly against gender reassignment and surrogacy. Throughout his papacy, and long before that, Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests. He did however describe the Church as \"female\" and encouraged parishes around the world to find more leadership roles for women in ways that were consistent with the Catholic teaching that does not currently allow women to be ordained. In 2021 Sister Raffaella Petrini was appointed secretary general of the papal state and under Pope Francis the Vatican did start an ongoing process of exploring whether women could take up the role of deacon, assisting in worship services. Sister Raffaella Petrini seen alongside a cardinal Nevertheless, some reformists were left disappointed that more progress was not made regarding equality for women, in a faith where the majority of churchgoers are women. During the latter part of his papacy, the Pope launched an ambitious three-year consultation process aimed at gauging the opinion of as many of the world's more-than-a-billion Catholics as possible. There were tens of thousands of listening sessions across the globe, meant to tease out the issues that Catholics most cared about. It transpired that roles for women and ways in which the Church could become more inclusive to LGBT+ Catholics were high on the list. While the process itself did not lead to decisive action on either front, it did speak volumes about Pope Francis' desire that his pontificate was rooted not in Rome and in clerics but in the lives of believers around the world. Throughout his papacy, there was a particular focus on reaching out to those on the economic and political margins, his words and actions encouraging his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged. The issue of dignity for migrants was hugely important to him throughout his papacy, but so too was building bridges with other Christian denominations, other religions and those of no faith. On occasions, to some Catholic traditionalists, the Pope's outreach appeared inappropriate for someone of his position, like his visit to a centre for asylum seekers outside Rome in spring 2016 when he washed and kissed the feet of refugees that included Muslims, Hindus and Coptic Christians. Pope Francis meets migrants on April 16, 2016 in Mytilene on the Greek island of Lesbos  As well as becoming a passionate voice for migrants - once going to lay a wreath on the waters where many had died on their perilous journeys - he also linked the impact of climate change to poverty. In speeches, including one to US Congress, and in one of his most important pieces of work, the decree Laudato Si, Pope Francis talked of environmental damage amounting to rich countries inflicting harm on poor ones. Vehemently anti-war, the Pope frequently talked of conflict itself equating to failure. He called the war in Gaza \"terrorism\" and from early on he implored that there be a ceasefire. He met the families of the Israelis abducted by Hamas on 7 October 2023, but also spoke passionately about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, particularly children, and made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza City. But sometimes a longing to build bridges was seen by some observers as getting in the way of Pope Francis taking a firm stance against wrongdoing. In the eyes of many, he failed to unequivocally call out Russian aggression in Ukraine or tackle China's surveillance and persecution of its Catholics. From the very start of his papacy, he also faced huge tasks confronting misconduct much closer to home. The scourge of corruption had long dogged the upper echelons of the Catholic Church. Early on, Pope Francis closed thousands of unauthorised Vatican bank accounts, and in the latter half of his time he introduced new rules on financial transparency. It was in the way he dealt with the horrors of child sexual abuse by those associated with the Catholic Church that made it clear he knew it was something he would be judged by. \"From the very start of my papacy, I felt I was being called to take responsibility for all the evil committed by certain priests,\" he wrote in Hope. As an illustration of the scale of the problem that remains, in 2020 the Catholic Church released lists of living members of clergy in the US alone found to have been accused of sexual abuses - these included clergy linked to child pornography and rape. There were around 2,000. \"With shame and repentance, the Church must seek pardon for the terrible damage that those clergy have caused with their sexual abuse of children, a crime that causes deep wounds of pain,\" he recently wrote. Pope Francis greeting cardinals on Easter Sunday 2025 Among other initiatives, Pope Francis introduced rules that meant members of the Church had a responsibility to report on abuse if they had knowledge of it, otherwise they risked being removed from their positions. Though he made errors of judgement, on occasions publicly supporting clergy even though they were alleged to have failed to deal with abuse, Pope Francis was quick to apologise for his own mistakes and for the deep failings of the Church. Both at the Vatican and abroad he would frequently meet with Church abuse victims. Saying \"sorry\" for abuse was the prime focus of some foreign trips. A huge part of Pope Francis' legacy is the way in which he changed the face of the upper echelons of the Catholic Church through his selection of new cardinals. In fact, about 80% of the cardinals that will select the next pope were appointed by Pope Francis. What is striking about those selections is their diversity, with many coming from South America, Africa and Asia. It was part of Pope Francis' mission to consolidate a change in the centre of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe, where it was in decline, towards the places it was thriving, and to reflect that in Church leadership. The posthumous outpouring of tributes to him from across the globe is perhaps one sign that shift is working. Why is the Pope doing a long tour when he's so frail?

GPs Vicky and Craig Trotter can often be seen running through Brampton, in Cumbria, while training for the 26.2-mile (42km) race. But Mr Trotter only took up running after he became critically ill with coronavirus in December 2020, before vaccines were available. He said the experience made him reflect on his health and inspired him to exercise more and lose four stone (25.4kg) in weight. \"At the time I was really quite a bit overweight, wasn't particularly active, had a young, small family and it really made me think,\" he said. \"As you lose weight you start building in more exercises.

        "title": "King Charles and Queen Camilla have 'heavy hearts' after Pope's death",
        "content": "King Charles has said he and Queen Camilla have \"heavy hearts\" after Pope Francis's death, as they paid tribute to his \"compassion\" and \"tireless commitment\" to people of faith. In a statement, the King said that though \"deeply saddened\", their sorrow had been \"somewhat eased\" by the Pope being able to share an Easter greeting with the world on Sunday, before he died aged 88. The King and Camilla met the pontiff on a state visit to Italy earlier this month, which the couple said they remembered with \"particular affection\". Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales, echoed the King's comments, saying the Pope's death \"brings great sadness to so many\". Follow updates on this story The King and Queen's state visit to the Vatican in early April had been cancelled because of the Pope's poor health, but they managed to visit him privately during their trip to Italy. The meeting was arranged at the last minute and took place on 9 April - the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary - with the pontiff wishing them a happy anniversary. In his tribute, the King said: \"His Holiness will be remembered for his compassion, his concern for the unity of the Church and for his tireless commitment to the common causes of all people of faith, and to those of goodwill who work for the benefit of others. \"His belief that care for Creation is an existential expression of faith in God resounded with so many across the world.  \"Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many.\" He said he and the Queen \"remember with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\".  Cardinal Vincent Nichols described the Pope as \"a voice proclaiming the innate dignity of every human being, especially those who are poor or marginalised\". At a mass at Westminster Cathedral on Monday evening, he said while there was a \"sadness of loss\", there remained a \"confidence of faith and hope\". \"His voice so often called us not to optimism, but to renewed effort to protect those who were without hope, who could see no way forward,\" he said. \"He was sharply critical of all who ignored the wellbeing of so many and held them to be of no significance in their calculations and actions.\" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, currently the most senior Church of England priest, described the Pope as a \"holy man of God\" who was \"also very human\". \"Francis's whole life and ministry was centred on Jesus who comes among us not to be served, but to serve,\" he added. The King said he remembered meeting Pope Francis on several occasions - including the first in 2017 - with \"particular affection\" Also paying tribute, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the Pope's leadership of the Catholic Church as \"courageous\" and coming from a \"place of deep humility\". \"Pope Francis was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten,\" Sir Keir said.  \"He was close to the realities of human fragility, meeting Christians around the world facing war, famine, persecution and poverty. \"Yet he never lost the faith-fuelled hope of a better world.\" Pope Francis had resumed some official duties earlier this month during his recovery from double pneumonia. He made his first public appearance since becoming ill on 6 April, when he appeared in St Peter's Square in a wheelchair during a special jubilee mass for the sick following his discharge from hospital two weeks previously. In his final address on Easter Sunday, read out by a member of the clergy,  the Pope reiterated his frequent call for peace, saying it could not be achieved without \"freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others\". Pope Francis's death sets into motion the process for the Church to select a new leader, who is elected by 135 cardinals. Cardinal Nichols is among those expected to travel to Rome in the coming days as a period of mourning gets under way ahead of the Pope's funeral and the conclave meeting to elect his successor. There are four cardinals based in the UK but only three - Cardinal Nichols, Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe and Rome-based Cardinal Arthur Roche - are younger than 80 and therefore of voting age. Speaking at a news conference, Cardinal Nichols and Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe both appeared to rule themselves out of becoming the next Pope.  Cardinal Radcliffe, 79, a theologian and former master of the worldwide Dominican Order, said the Holy Spirit \"is far too wise to even think of me for the shortest moment\". Cardinal Nichols, who will be 80 in November, said he is \"too old, not capable\". The next Pope must be someone of great inner strength and peace, he added. Cardinal Radcliffe said he was struck by Pope Francis's \"profound desire to make everybody seem welcome\".  \"This is one of his phrases, he would say 'all are welcome, todos, todos, todos', because he believed the church should be a universal home,\" he said.

        "title": "Palestinian Red Crescent says Israel lying about Gaza medics' killings",
        "content": "The medics were among 15 Palestinians killed when Israeli soldiers fired on emergency vehicles The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has described an Israeli military report into a deadly attack on its paramedics as \"full of lies\". The Israeli military said in its report that \"professional failures\" led to the killing of the 15 workers in Gaza. It dismissed the deputy commander of the unit involved.  A spokeswoman for the PRCS said the report was \"invalid\" as it \"justifies and shifts the responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different\". Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military. The UN's humanitarian chief in Gaza suggested the investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall. \"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\" The Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) investigation was carried out by its Fact-Finding Mechanism, which it describes as impartial. The IDF report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly. It blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances. But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing. The footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn. The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform. The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. The report said this was done \"to prevent further harm\" and that the decision to do so \"was reasonable under the circumstances\". They were not recovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. Journalists invited to an Israeli military briefing on Sunday were shown aerial footage, shot in the early hours of 23 March, which showed the series of three attacks. It also showed that several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at.  Israeli officials said this proved that troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened. The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. Israel launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

        "content": "Singer-songwriter Tom Grennan has been meeting the BBC's Make a Difference heroes  The singer Tom Grennan said he now found it easier to talk about mental health issues to his friends than when he was younger. The 29-year-old Bedford-born singer made the comment during a conversation with a winner of the BBC's Make a Difference Awards (MAD) which recognises ordinary people who have made a difference to their communities.  Talking to MAD winner, Kevin Willows, who helped set up a bereavement walking group, Grennan revealed the importance of walking to him.  \"If I'm ever feeling like I want to get something off my chest, if it's with friends, or my wife or my parents, I always say, 'can we go for a walk?'\" said Grennan. Discussing the importance of walking and exercise, Grennan said \"a walk can save a life, talking can save a life\". The son of a builder revealed how growing up in Bedford meant he often found it tricky to navigate his emotional side. \"Little towns are very much like alpha (towns), with boys anyway, nobody wants to seem like they're weak,\" he said. It was his mother who encouraged him to express his emotions, telling him \"if you've got emotions then let them out, because letting them out is always the best thing\". Grennan described how on a return visit to his home town, he had open conversations with his friends about \"our feelings, about what was going on and there was a lot of tears, there was a lot of laughter, those barriers were breaking down,\" he said. \"I think as friends we became closer and cut the rubbish out.  \"And as grown men now we can sit down and talk about what we're going through and how we can lend a hand.\" Grennan said being the victim of an unprovoked attack and hospitalised with a broken jaw while at university was when he first encountered being depressed. \"It ruined me (the attack), why did it happen to me, why did these people not like me?,\" he questioned at the time.  It was by joining a music group, where he met his best friend, and talking as well as singing which helped him recover from the trauma.

        "content": "Thousands of mourners have paid their respects to the late Pope The funeral of Pope Francis will take place on Saturday, in front of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.  Preparations have begun for the conclave, the process by which cardinals will elect the next Pope.  The Pope's body is lying in state inside St Peter's Basilica.  Thousands of mourners have queued to say a final goodbye before his funeral takes place on Saturday, at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Papal funerals have historically been very elaborate, but the instructions set out by Francis are much simpler.  He will be the first Pope in more than a century not to be buried inside the Vatican. Instead, he will be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Francis asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket lined with zinc - unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.  Thousands of members of the public and clergy paid tribute to the Pope's body in the days leading up to the funeral The service will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals. Patriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests from across the globe will also take part. After a concluding prayer formally entrusting the Pope to God, the pontiff's body will be moved to St Mary Major for the burial. A nine-day mourning period, known as Novemdiales, will then begin. Dozens of world leaders and thousands of worshippers will attend the funeral. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and French President Emmanuel Macron have said they will attend, as has Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, Francis's home country. The Prince of Wales will represent King Charles. Read more: Who is going to the Pope's funeral? The church Pope Francis kept returning to - and chose as his final resting place Pope Francis died on Easter Monday aged 88, following a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure.  The death was confirmed and announced by the Pope's \"camerlengo\", or chamberlain - currently Irish-American cardinal Kevin Farrell.  The camerlengo manages the various procedures and rites which follow the death of a Pope.  Pope Francis made Kevin Farrell a cardinal in 2016 and named him camerlengo in 2023 As part of this, Cardinal Farrell locked and sealed the Pope's home, and destroyed the Pope's ring and lead seal, which is used to authenticate official documents. The camerlengo also organises the conclave to elect the new pope.  They can become pope, but this has only happened twice: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. Read more: Who is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the Vatican? Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith We're orphans now, say Gaza Catholics the Pope called daily The new Pope is elected by the cardinals - all men who were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. There are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, but only 135 can cast ballots as those over the age of 80 can take part in debate but cannot vote. Traditionally the conclave doesn't start until after a 15-day mourning period.  However, in 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict changed the rules to allow it to begin earlier if the cardinals wished.  Read more: Who will be the next Pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable contest Will the next Pope be from Africa? Choosing the Pope: 'The conclave is intimidating' During the voting period, the cardinals are cut off from the outside world â denied phones and access to the internet or newspapers. They sleep in Casa Santa Marta, a five-story guesthouse within the Vatican complex.  The election is held in strict secrecy inside the Sistine Chapel, famously painted by Michelangelo. Each cardinal votes for the candidate they wish to become Pope. They can vote for themselves if they wish.  A new Pope is elected when a candidate has secured the support of 90 cardinals - which can take several rounds of voting.  In previous centuries, conclaves have gone on for weeks or months. Some cardinals have even died during the process.  Read more:  How the next Pope is chosen To the outside world, the only information about how the conclave is progressing is smoke from the chapel's chimney when ballot papers are burned after each round of voting.  Black smoke signals failure. White smoke means a new Pope has been chosen. The new Pope normally appears on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square within an hour of his selection.  The senior cardinal confirms the decision with the words \"Habemus Papam\" - Latin for \"we have a Pope\" - and introduces the new pontiff by his chosen papal name. For example, Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi. The day before he died, Pope Francis waved to the crowds from the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square and wished them a happy Easter - his final words in public In theory, any Roman Catholic man who has been baptised can be considered. In practice, however, the cardinals prefer to select one of their own. In 2013, Francis became the first pontiff to hail from Latin America - a region that accounts for around 28% of the world's Catholics - and the southern hemisphere.  Historical precedent suggests the cardinals are far more likely to pick a European. Of the 266 popes chosen to date, 217 have been from Italy. Several Vatican analysts have suggested Francis's successor could come from outside Europe - not least because the late Pope appointed more than 140 cardinals from beyond the continent. The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and is an important source of authority for the world's roughly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics.  They believe the Pope represents a direct line back to Jesus Christ. He is considered a living successor to St Peter, who was chief among Christ's initial disciples, the Apostles. About half of all Christians worldwide are Roman Catholics. Other denominations, including Protestants and Orthodox Christians, do not recognise the Pope's authority. The Pope lives in Vatican City, the smallest independent state in the world. It is surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. The Pope does not receive a salary, but all his travel costs and living expenses are paid for by the Vatican. What are your questions about the next stages for the Catholic Church?

        "title": "Vatican announces death of Pope Francis aged 88",
        "content": "Pope Francis became the Roman Catholic Church's spiritual leader in 2013 Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, has died on Easter Monday aged 88. The Vatican said he died following a stroke, less than 24 hours after appearing in a wheelchair at St Peter's Square to lead an Easter address in front of thousands of worshipers.  The Pope's death follows a period of ill-health that saw him spend five weeks in hospital with double pneumonia. Services have been held around the world as some 1.4bn Catholics begin to mark the Pope's death. Meanwhile, mourners have started to arrive at the Vatican. Francis, who was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected as Pope in 2013. In a statement published by the Vatican early on Monday, Cardinal Kevin Farrell said the pope had \"returned to the home of the Father\". A statement continued: \"He taught us to live the values ââof the Gospel with fidelity, courage and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised.\" The Vatican later confirmed Francis died after suffering a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure at abut 07:35 local time (05:30 GMT; 06:30 BST). LIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88  ANALYSIS: The Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church EXPLAINER: What next after the death of Pope Francis? WATCH: The pontiff's last public appearance on Easter Sunday IN PICTURES: Defining images of the first Latin American pope Pope Francis's body will be moved to the Chapel of Domus Sanctae Marthae, the Vatican guesthouse where he opted to live after becoming Pope, as opposed to the more lavish papal apartment used by his predecessors.  Cardinal Farrell - who holds the position of camerlengo, the cardinal who oversees the transition to a new Pope - will be joined by other senior church figures and Francis's family later on Monday when he presides over the official confirmation of the pontiff's death. Francis will lie in state in St Peter's Basilica, where mourners will be able to attend to pay their respects, before a funeral is held, which usually takes place within four to six days after a Pope dies. The Pope requested that some elements of the elaborate death rites which usually take place after a pontiff's death be dispensed with, including using an ornate coffin and displaying his body on a raised platform. In his final testament, released by the Vatican late on Monday, he asked to be buried in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Many of his predecessors instead chose St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. He wrote: \"The tomb should be in the ground; simple, without particular ornamentation, bearing only the inscription: Franciscus.\" Mourners gathered at St Peter's Square in Vatican City following the death of Pope Francis Francis's death sets in motion the process of selecting a new Pope through an election known as a conclave, which typically takes place between 15 and 20 days after a Pope's death. The College of Cardinals - the Church's most senior officials - will be summoned to Rome to take part in the secretive vote. In this case 135 cardinals - those aged under 80 - will be eligible to take part. They will be shut in the Vatican until they reach an agreement, cut off from communicating with the outside world, in a process that can take days. The outcome will set the direction of the Church, possibly for decades. The Pope appointed cardinals from a broader range of geographic and theological backgrounds than some of his successors, which could make the outcome of the process even more difficult to predict than usual. A crowd gathered in St Peter's Square late on Monday for a rosary prayer in the Pope's memory Francis had endured bouts of ill-health in recent years, and was most recently discharged from Rome's Gemelli Hospital on 23 March after being treated for pneumonia in both lungs. The stay involved two \"very critical episodes\" which endangered his life, according to one of his doctors, and medics had advised a period of rest. Francis continued to make some public appearances in his final weeks. Although the pontiff missed services on Good Friday and Holy Saturday, he did mark Holy Thursday with a traditional visit to Regina Coeli prison. However, he did not take part in the tradition of washing prisoner's feet. During his final public appearance on the balcony of St Peter's basilica on Easter Sunday, Francis spoke briefly but did not recite a full blessing, instead inviting an archbishop to do so on his behalf.  Even so, his appearance on a key day in the Catholic calendar was celebrated by worshipers. In the hours after his death was confirmed, tributes poured in from around the globe. The acting head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of York, described him as a \"holy man of God\" who was \"also very human\". Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni praised the Pope as a \"great man\" and said she had the privilege of enjoying his friendship, advice and teachings.   King Charles III, who met with the Pope privately in early April during his state visit to Italy, said in a statement that he was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of the Pope's death and praised his \"tireless commitment\".  UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer shared his condolences \"to the whole of the Catholic Church\" and called the pontiff a \"Pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten\". US President Donald Trump wrote on social media: \"Rest in peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" Before he took the name Francis as his papal name, the Pope was called Jorge Mario Bergoglio He was born on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where his parents had fled to from their native Italy to escape fascism.  In 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI became the first Pope to retire voluntarily in almost 600 years - and for almost a decade, the Vatican was home to two Popes.  Francis was chosen to succeed him during the conclave that followed Benedict's departure, and became the first non-European Pope since Syrian-born Gregory III, who died in 741. During his early life, Francis worked as a nightclub bouncer and floor sweeper, before graduating as a chemist. Prior to being elected as Pope, Francis positioned himself as a compromise candidate by appealing to conservatives while attracting the reformers with his liberal stance on social justice.  His early actions as Pope included washing the feet of the elderly and prisoners and advocating for the rights of refugees and migrants.  But on many of the Church's teachings, Pope Francis was a traditionalist.  He was at times supportive of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but Francis did not favour calling it marriage. This, he said, would be \"an attempt to destroy God's plan\". Shortly after becoming Pope, he took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn \"from the moment of conception\". Francis's papacy heralded many firsts, and while he never stopped introducing reforms to the Catholic Church, he remained popular among many traditionalists.

        "title": "Francis: Traditional Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church",
        "content": "His ascension to the papacy heralded many firsts. Francis was the first Pope from the Americas or the Southern Hemisphere. Not since Syrian-born Gregory III died in 741 had there been a non-European Bishop of Rome.  He was also the first Jesuit to be elected to the throne of St Peter - Jesuits were historically looked on with suspicion by Rome.  His predecessor, Benedict XVI, was the first Pope to retire voluntarily in almost 600 years and for almost a decade the Vatican Gardens hosted two popes. Many Catholics had assumed the new pontiff would be a younger man - but Cardinal Bergoglio of Argentina was already in his seventies when he became Pope in 2013. He had presented himself as a compromise candidate: appealing to conservatives with orthodox views on sexual matters while attracting the reformers with his liberal stance on social justice. Follow our live updates  Send us your questions It was hoped his unorthodox background would help rejuvenate the Vatican and reinvigorate its holy mission. But within the Vatican bureaucracy some of Francis's attempts at reform met with resistance and his predecessor, who died in 2022, remained popular among traditionalists. From the moment of his election, Francis indicated he would do things differently. He received his cardinals informally and standing - rather than seated on the papal throne. On 13 March 2013, Pope Francis emerged on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square.  Clad simply in white, he bore a new name which paid homage to St Francis of Assisi, the 13th Century preacher and animal lover. He was determined to favour humility over pomp and grandeur. He shunned the papal limousine and insisted on sharing the bus taking other cardinals home. The new Pope set a moral mission for the 1.2 billion-strong flock. \"Oh, how I would like a poor Church, and for the poor,\" he remarked. His last act as head of the Catholic Church was to appear on Easter Sunday on the balcony of St Peter's Square, waving at thousands of worshippers after weeks in hospital with double pneumonia. Pope Francis greets his predecessor, Pope emeritus Benedict XVI, at a papal Mass in 2014 Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 17 December 1936 - the eldest of five children. His parents had fled their native Italy to escape the evils of fascism. He enjoyed tango dancing and became a supporter of his local football club, San Lorenzo. He was lucky to escape with his life after an initial and serious bout of pneumonia, undergoing an operation to remove part of a lung. It would leave him susceptible to infection throughout his life. As an elderly man he also suffered from pain in his right knee, which he described as a \"physical humiliation\". Jorge Mario Bergoglio as a schoolboy in Buenos Aires in the 1940s The young Bergoglio worked as a nightclub bouncer and floor sweeper, before graduating as a chemist.  At a local factory, he worked closely with Esther Ballestrino, who campaigned against Argentina's military dictatorship. She was tortured, her body never found. He became a Jesuit, studied philosophy and taught literature and psychology. Ordained a decade later, he won swift promotion, becoming provincial superior for Argentina in 1973. Pope Francis was a lifelong fan of San Lorenzo, his local football team in Buenos Aires Some felt he failed to do enough to oppose the generals of Argentina's brutal military regime. He was accused of involvement in the military kidnapping of two priests during Argentina's Dirty War, a period when thousands of people were tortured or killed, or disappeared, from 1976 to 1983. The two priests were tortured but eventually found alive - heavily sedated and semi-naked. Bergoglio faced charges of failing to inform the authorities that their work in poor neighbourhoods had been endorsed by the Church. This, if true, had abandoned them to the death squads. It was an accusation he flatly denied, insisting he had worked behind the scenes to free them. Asked why he did not speak out, he reportedly said it was too difficult. In truth - at 36 years old - he found himself in a chaos that would have tried the most seasoned leader. He certainly helped many who tried to flee the country. He also had differences with fellow Jesuits who believed Bergoglio lacked interest in liberation theology - that synthesis of Christian thought and Marxist sociology which sought to overthrow injustice. He, by contrast, preferred a gentler form of pastoral support. At times, the relationship bordered on estrangement. When he sought initially to become Pope in 2005 some Jesuits breathed a sigh of relief. Pope John Paul II appoints Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 He was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 and then became Archbishop.  Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal in 2001 and he took up posts in the Church's civil service, the Curia. He cultivated a reputation as a man of simple tastes, eschewing many of the trappings of a senior cleric. He usually flew economy and preferred to wear the black gown of a priest - rather than the red and purple of his new position. In his sermons, he called for social inclusion and criticised governments that failed to pay attention to the poorest in society.  \"We live in the most unequal part of the world,\" he said, \"which has grown the most, yet reduced misery the least.\" As Pope, he made great efforts to heal the thousand-year rift with the Eastern Orthodox Church. In recognition, for the first time since the Great Schism of 1054, the Patriarch of Constantinople attended the installation of a new Bishop of Rome. Pope Francis brought the Israeli President, Shimon Peres (left), and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas, together to pray for peace in 2014 Francis worked with Anglicans, Lutherans and Methodists and persuaded the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to join him to pray for peace. After attacks by Muslim militants, he said it was not right to identify Islam with violence. \"If I speak of Islamic violence, then I have to speak of Catholic violence too,\" he declared. Politically, he allied himself with the Argentine government's claim on the Falklands, telling a service: \"We come to pray for those who have fallen, sons of the homeland who set out to defend their mother, the homeland, to claim the country that is theirs.\" And, as a Spanish-speaking Latin American, he provided a crucial service as mediator when the US government edged towards historic rapprochement with Cuba. It is difficult to imagine a European Pope playing such a critical diplomatic role. Pope Francis meets former President Fidel Castro during his visit to Havana in 2015 On many of the Church's teachings, Pope Francis was a traditionalist. He was \"as uncompromising as Pope John Paul II... on euthanasia, the death penalty, abortion, the right to life, human rights and the celibacy of priests\", according to Monsignor Osvaldo Musto, who was at seminary with him. He said the Church should welcome people regardless of their sexual orientation, but insisted gay adoption was a form of discrimination against children. There were warm words in favour of some kind of same-sex unions for gay couples, but Francis did not favour calling it marriage. This, he said, would be \"an attempt to destroy God's plan\". Shortly after becoming Pope in 2013, he took part in an anti-abortion march in Rome - calling for rights of the unborn \"from the moment of conception\".  He called on gynaecologists to invoke their consciences and sent a message to  Ireland - as it held a referendum on the subject - begging people there to protect the vulnerable. He resisted the ordination of women, declaring that Pope John Paul II had once and for all ruled out the possibility. And, although he seemed at first to allow that contraception might be used to prevent disease, he praised Paul VI's teaching on the subject - which warned it might reduce women to instruments of male satisfaction. In 2015, Pope Francis told an audience in the Philippines that contraception involved \"the destruction of the family through the privation of children\". It was not the absence of children itself that he saw as so damaging, but the wilful decision to avoid them. Pope Francis, wearing a yellow covering against the driving rain, waves to crowds in Manila during a visit to the Philippines The greatest challenge to his papacy, however, came on two fronts: from those who accused him of failing to tackle child abuse and from conservative critics who felt that he was diluting the faith. In particular, they had in mind his moves to allow divorced and remarried Catholics to take Communion. Conservatives also adopted the issue of child abuse as a weapon in their long-running campaign. In August 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria ViganÃ², a former Apostolic Nuncio to the US, published an 11-page declaration of war. He released a letter describing a series of warnings made to the Vatican about the behaviour of a former cardinal, Theodore McCarrick. It was alleged that McCarrick had been a serial abuser who attacked both adults and minors. The Pope, Archbishop ViganÃ² said, had made him a \"trusted councillor\" despite knowing he was deeply corrupted. The solution was clear, he said: Pope Francis should resign. \"These homosexual networks,\" the archbishop claimed, \"act under the concealment of secrecy and lie with the power of octopus tentacles... and are strangling the entire Church.\" The ensuing row threatened to engulf the Church. McCarrick was eventually defrocked in February 2019, after an investigation by the Vatican. Pope Francis met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2023 During the Covid pandemic, Francis cancelled his regular appearances in St Peter's Square - to prevent the virus circulating. In an important example of moral leadership, he also declared that being vaccinated was a universal obligation. In 2022, he became the first Pope for more than a century to bury his predecessor - after Benedict's death at the age of 95. By now, he had his own health problems - with several hospitalisations. But Francis was determined to continue with his efforts to promote global peace and inter-religious dialogue. In 2023, he made a pilgrimage to South Sudan, pleading with the country's leaders to end conflict. He appealed for an end to the \"absurd and cruel war\" in Ukraine, although he disappointed Ukrainians by appearing to swallow Russia's propaganda message of having been provoked into its invasion. And a year later, he embarked on an ambitious four-country, two-continent odyssey; with stops in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Singapore. In recent months, Francis had struggled with his health. In March 2025, he spent five weeks in hospital with pneumonia in both lungs. Pope Francis poses with a model of a dove of peace during a visit to Mexico Jorge Mario Bergoglio came to the throne of St Peter determined to change it.  There will be some who would have preferred a more liberal leader, and critics will point to his perceived weakness in confronting the institution's legacy of clerical sexual abuse. But change it, he did. He appointed more than 140 cardinals from non-European countries and bequeaths his successor a Church that is far more global in outlook than the one he inherited. And, to set an example, he was the no-frills Pope who elected not to live in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace - complete with Sistine Chapel - but in the modern block next door (which Pope John Paul II had built as a guest house). He believed anything else would be vanity. \"Look at the peacock,\" he said, \"it's beautiful if you look at it from the front. But if you look at it from behind, you discover the truth.\" He also hoped he could shake up the institution itself, enhancing the Church's historic mission by cutting through internal strife, focusing on the poor and returning the Church to the people. \"We need to avoid the spiritual sickness of a Church that is wrapped up in its own world,\" he said shortly after his election. \"If I had to choose between a wounded Church that goes out on to the streets and a sick, withdrawn Church, I would choose the first.\" What are your questions about the next stages for the Catholic Church?

Rennan Laurente\nwas a volunteer helping organise the route the Pope would take through the\nstreets of the city. \"It never crossed my mind that I would get so close\nto him,\" she says. When the Popemobile was approaching, a couple asked Rennan to hold up their son, Miguel,\nso he could be blessed. But a security guard signalled no with his finger.  âAt\nthat moment, the Pope passed by in the Popemobile and waved three\ntimes with his hand,\" Rennan recalls. âHe kissed\nMiguelâs head, made the sign of the cross on his forehead, and then placed his\nhand on my forehead,â she says. âWe saw his kindness and nobility. He was the\npeopleâs Pope and he broke all the protocols.â How did Pope Francis die? The Vatican said he died following a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure at 07:35 local time (06:35 BST) on Monday. It followed a period of ill-health that saw the Pope spend five weeks in hospital with double pneumonia. When is the funeral? On Saturday in front of St Peter's Basilica.  The Pope will lie in state inside the church from Wednesday morning, and will remain there until his burial at St Mary Major in Rome, also on Saturday. How is a new Pope chosen? Once Pope Francis is buried, the dean of the College of Cardinals has up to 20 days to summon the cardinals to the Vatican to begin the process of electing the next Pope, known as a conclave. The below graphic goes through the key steps in the process. Who can become Pope? Roman Catholic men who have been baptised can be considered for election to become Pope. In theory, this could be any baptised man, but in practice, cardinals prefer to select one of their own. Marina RossiBBC News Brasil Many in Brazil people remember Pope Francisâs visit to the country in 2013. Murilo Bernardes\nwas among the thousands who\nwent to Rio de Janeiro to see the Pope in\nperson, and says his life was transformed by\nthe experience. âI had a good\njob, I was in a relationship, but I didnât feel happy,â he says. âI went to Rio\nwith no expectations. But when I saw that crowd, I thought, âthis is where I\nbelong'.â âSeeing the Pope\nwas incredibly moving. Heâs so charismatic - it felt like he\nwas looking into each of our eyes.â Bernardes says he\nreturned to his home in the countryside of SÃ£o Paulo âwith a heart full of\ncertainty about what I wantedâ. He left his job as an IT assistant and entered the seminary to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a priest. Father Murilo was ordained\nin 2020.  âI have a deep love for Pope Francis,\" he says. Sebastian UsherReporting from Jersusalem The official Israel X account shared a picture of Pope Francis praying at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, with a caption reading: \"May his memory be a blessing.\" It was just one of the thousands of such messages issued by countries around the world. But it was swiftly removed, apparently out of concern for a backlash from sectors of the Israeli public who see Pope Francis as having been anti-Israeli because of his repeated expressions of sympathy for the Palestinians, which intensified during the war in Gaza. The Pope also spoke of Israeli suffering, but this doesn't seem to have assuaged his critics in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself hasn't issued any public expression of mourning, although the country's president Isaac Herzog did offer an eloquent eulogy, praising Pope Francis as a man of deep faith and boundless compassion.  Shaun Dacosta and Srosh KhanBBC Newsbeat BBC Newsbeat has been speaking to younger people in the UK about how they remember Pope Francis. \"He was a great man,\" Lily, 22, tells us from outside a Catholic church in Liverpool. \"Hopefully the next person can expand on his work and follow the same values and do more.\" \"I think the Catholic church needed a change. You can't really base values nowadays on something that was written thousands of years ago. He went about it in a manner that was still respectful to the Catholic church.\" University student Benul, 20, is an altar server at his church in Sheffield. \"He really changed the way I view religion,\" he says of the late Pope. \"I found I could relate to him on many things. Even his age and where he's from... none of that really mattered to me because I felt I could really connect to him. \"He was a Pope of the people... young people loved him.\" Dressed in striped yellow, blue and red uniforms, the Swiss Guard is a striking sight at the Vatican.  Often known as \"the world's smallest army\", this 135-strong force has protected the Pope for five centuries.  Popular myth says their traditional garb, in the colours of the Medici family, were designed by Michelangelo, but they were actually created by the Swiss Guard Commander in 1905.  The Pope's army hails from Switzerland because during the Middle Ages and Renaissance the Swiss developed a reputation for being among Europe's best and most reliable mercenary soldiers. Recruits of the prestigious force must be Swiss, Catholic, single and under the age of 30. They are also required to complete basic training with the Swiss army. When there is no Pope, they protect the College of the Cardinals during sede vacante. Pope Francis's biographer has just been to pay his respects to the late pontiff, whose body has been placed in an open casket in the chapel of Casa Santa Marta. Austin Iverleigh tells the BBC that it wasn't until this visit that news of the Pope's death had truly sunk in. Asked what Pope Francis was like in life, Iverleigh says he was a \"extraordinary mixture of characteristics\", describing him as a joyful man who \"gave out an enormous vitality\". \"He always made you feel like he wanted you to be with him... he was a person that people are naturally drawn to.  \"He was someone who was full of life, and also showed us how to live,\" Iverleigh adds. In the lead-up to the funeral on Saturday, visitors will be given the opportunity to pay their respects to Pope Francis as he lies inside an open coffin in St Peter's Basilica.  This traditional period of lying in state lasts from from Wednesday until Saturday, giving mourners a chance to say a final goodbye. The Pope's body will be ceremonially moved into position inside the Basilica at 9:00 local time (08:00 BST) tomorrow morning. Following that, the Vatican says the basilica will open to anyone who wishes to visit during the following times: At the Vatican, mourners have been continuing to visit the Pope's residence to pay homage to the late pontiff, who lies in an open coffin. Chief Rabbi of Rome Riccardo Di Segni bows his head as he pays his respects Also visiting the chapel of Casa Santa Marta is Ignazio La Russa, president of the Italian senate Fans started gathering at San Lorenzo football club's chapel from Monday, to bid farewell to Pope Francis. \"The Pope leaves an unbreakable legacy,\" club President Marcelo Moretti tells Reuters news agency. \"For all San Lorenzo fans, he was a source of great pride. It is a very sad day.\" Moretti says he met Francis several times, most recently last September to ask permission to name a new stadium after him in the Boedo neighbourhood where the club is based. \"He accepted, with great emotion,\" Moretti says. Some of those working at the club's chapel on Monday could be seen carrying football shirts, adorned with the Pope's face and name. Ione WellsReporting from Buenos Aires Pope Francis is not just remembered in Argentina for his work helping the poor and serving communities while archbishop of Buenos Aires - he is also known as a big fan of his local football team, San Lorenzo. The club is currently planning commemorative events for him at its on-site chapel, and there is even a statue here of him donning the club colours.  Mark LowenReporting from Rome Iâve spent the last few hours perched between the tables of Il Pozzetto restaurant on the gorgeous cobbled street of Borgo Pio, a couple of hundred metres from the Vatican. It's a place that I used to pop to during my years as the BBC's Rome correspondent, where the usual daily fare of spaghetti carbonara or tiramisu is now enjoyed not just by locals but also by pilgrims, who have come in their tens of thousands since the death of Pope Francis yesterday.  Among them are Savannah, Paul, Alison, Galia and Eli. They tell me the air is thick with emotion. The group travelled to Rome from the US to celebrate Savannahâs recent confirmation, but say theyâre now honoured to be part of a sombre moment in history. Meanwhile, American Catholic Steve Bouchey tells me he has had a tough year - he lost his wife and suffered a string of health issues - so a friend who works at the Vatican arranged a private audience for him with Pope Francis tomorrow. Steve tells me he will instead be going to view the Pope's body. âI think this is meant to be, to be in his presence somehow,\" he says. From tomorrow until his funeral on Saturday, the Pope will lie in state inside the iconic St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican for a period of public mourning. We've created this guide to how the day will play out - take a look at our graphic below get a sense of the space in which mourners will be invited to pay their respects: Laura GozziReporting from Rome Rome is always teeming, and Easter usually kicks off the long\ntourist season.  This year was always busier than usual because of the jubilee\nthat has brought even more Catholics to the city.  Still, a number of taxi\ndrivers I spoke to today said they noticed a gradual but palpable influx of\npeople flocking into Rome since the Pope's death was announced.  This evening,\nthe streets around the Vatican were very busy, and St Peter's Square was\nbustling.  Up to 250,000 are expected to attend the Pope's funeral on Saturday.  Mourners are gathered in St Peter's Square for a rosary prayer for Pope Francis, following a similar service yesterday evening. We'll bring you the latest pictures from the Vatican shortly. The short answer is no. Only Roman Catholic men who have been baptised can be considered for election to become Pope. In theory, this could be any baptised man, but in practice, cardinals prefer to select one of their own. In addition, only men can be ordained as a priest in the Catholic Church. One argument is that Jesusâs twelve disciples were all men, therefore it should be men who lead the Church. But arguments have also been put forward for both male and female ordination.  For example, in Christian teaching, men and women are made in the image of God, therefore both are equal before God and should thus be ordained equally. Sean CoughlanRoyal correspondent Representing King Charles at the funeral of Pope Francis will be one of the biggest international events that Prince William will have undertaken on his own so far. It marks another step on to the global stage, after engagements such as his meeting with US President Trump in France last year. Heâll be with Trump again in Rome, alongside figures such as President Macron of France and Chancellor Scholz of Germany. Sending the Prince of Wales to this weekendâs funeral in the Vatican follows in the footsteps of his father, Charles, who as Prince of Wales, went to the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005. The King and Queen have only recently returned from Italy, and the King, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, has publicly paid his respects to Pope Francis, describing his death as a âdevastating lossâ and praising his legacy of compassion. On Tuesday, the King wore a black tie when he met the New Zealand PM in Windsor Castle â and flags were flown at half-mast on royal residences. The King has been personally committed to building bridges between different faiths and the planned state visit to the Vatican, that was cancelled because of the Popeâs health, would have seen the King at an ecumenical service in the Sistine Chapel. Prince William, who will one day be the head of the Church of England, is now heading to the Vatican for what will be an historic event.

        "title": "How do you solve a problem like Nottinghamshire's potholes?",
        "content": "Will there ever be enough money to fix all of Nottinghamshire's roads? \"Damage to tyres, bent wheels, excessive suspension wear, we've noticed an increase in it all.\" Nottinghamshire mechanic Tom O'Brien says he has seen a steady rise in cars damaged by potholes over the past decade. \"We've had incidents where there's a pothole in the local area and you get two or three cars in that day and they all mention that particular pothole,\" he said. He tells the BBC it is difficult to drive in a straight line on local roads \"because you just find yourself weaving in and out of the potholes\". For local politicians with an election on the horizon, it is the one topic they know they can't swerve. While the vast majority of Nottinghamshire County Council's budget is actually spent on social care, ask any politician or party activist to name the number one topic that comes up on the doorstep - and the state of the roads is often the answer. Mechanic Tom O'Brien says damage caused by potholes can cost hundreds of pounds to fix With a very finely balanced council chamber, where the Conservatives only need to lose one seat to lose overall control, it was always going to be a big election issue. So with less than two weeks until polling day, we asked local political leaders about their pothole pledges. Current council leader Conservative Sam Smith has promised to invest Â£200m in road repairs, but also said he would put an end to temporary fixes \"that come out every time it rains\". \"We will scrap that and do proper patch resurfacing works right across the county,\" he said. He added they would resurface pavements and clear drains at the same time as road resurfacing in what he called \"a whole street approach\". Labour group leader Kate Foale, meanwhile, said pavements needed just as much attention as the roads themselves. She said extra funding had already been provided by central government but she would lobby for more. \"We need to continue working with the [East Midlands] mayor, continue working with the Labour government and say to them - our roads and pavements are in a bad state, we need more funding from you and we need to prioritise it,\" she said. Jason Zadrozny, leader of the Ashfield Independents, said sorting out the county's roads was \"dead easy\".  He said the council should enter into partnerships with \"big companies like Tarmac\" in order to fully resurface more roads. \"It's shown it can work, we would bring that to Nottinghamshire and put some pride back into our county,\" he said. Mr O'Brien and his team are seeing more and more damage caused by potholes Reform UK's John Doddy said potholes were \"no laughing matter\", and the council's approach to repairs had not been good enough. \"There's no point in going to an individual pothole if there's 10 other potholes,\" he said. \"There's no point in doing 10 potholes if you need to do the whole road. Sometimes you've got to prioritise resurfacing roads.\" Liberal Democrat candidate David Watts says there needs to be a programme to tackle \"the very worst roads\". \"It needs money investing in it. If that means it takes slightly longer to do because we have to raise the money, so be it,\" he said. \"We want to able to say to people - here is our programme to repair the roads in your area over this time period so people know that it will happen.\" The Green Party's Ben Gray said there needs to be a \"fresh approach,\" and he would look into the \"oversight\" of Via East Midlands - the council-owned company that carries out road repairs. \"We need to improve the quality of repairs that are done and improve the general quality of roads across the East Midlands,\" he said. Reading these quotes from different parties, it is striking how similar much of the messaging is. There appears to be near-unanimity that at least two things are required - more money and a focus on resurfacing rather than repairs.  In the long-term, it is hoped part of the solution may lie with a different organisation entirely, with the East Midlands Combined County Authority having taken on responsibility for highways funding in the region, rather than cash coming directly from the Department for Transport. For now at least, those who want to run the county council know they will have to answer to the disgruntled drivers they meet on the doorstep, for whom the arguments over who is to blame are superfluous. As Mr O'Brien told us: \"They've got to spend more on the roads. They're quick enough to charge us high taxes.\" Polling day for the Nottinghamshire County Council election is 1 May.

        "title": "Trump backs defence secretary after reports of second Signal chat leak",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Hegseth calls media 'hoaxsters' in response to new Signal leak allegations President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. In the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages. \"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\" This video can not be played Watch: Trump brushes off latest Signal leak: 'Try something new' White House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it. Trump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary. \"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said.  Trump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\". Hegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times. In a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared. The messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets.  Hegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders. His brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans. Unlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen. The existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser.  Although the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel. Signal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices. Hegseth and his wife Jennifer Rauchet, who reportedly was part of the second Signal chat, attended the White House Easter egg roll Five takeaways from first leaked US military chat group Pentagon watchdog probing Hegseth's Signal app use Four lingering questions about 'Signalgate' What is messaging app Signal and how secure is it? The second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (Â£670bn). Hegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\". In a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired. \"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said.  Hegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\". In an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\". He added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\" Ullyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\" However, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\". He echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\". Washington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. US air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry.

        "title": "John Cena becomes most decorated WWE wrestler in history",
        "content": "WrestleMania has come to a close with John Cena making history winning the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Championship for a record-breaking 17th time. The win over Cody Rhodes, which came following a surprise interference from rapper Travis Scott, means Cena has overtaken Ric Flair by winning more world titles than anyone in the history of the company.  Cena previously announced he would retire at the end of 2025, meaning this was the final WrestleMania ever for the most decorated wrestler to ever set foot in a WWE ring (though most know never to say never in wrestling).  Other new champions were crowned amid further twists and surprises, but none more significant than the final match of the weekend. It was a historic night for many reasons, not least that this was the first WrestleMania to air live on Netflix, where it could be watched by many of the firm's 300 million subscribers around the world. The company paid a pretty penny for the privilege - a 10 year $5bn (Â£4bn) deal to bring WWE's weekly shows and monthly events to the streaming service (though not all territories get to see everything). Netflix's experience airing WWE shows since January - it says the first live show picked up just shy of five million views, external - seemed to pay dividends as WrestleMania aired largely without glitches. And the firms had an even greater argument to make for its significance before the first bell was rung, when WWE announced it had acquired Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, one of the largest wrestling promotions in Mexico. But fans will say all of that is fine and dandy - what matters is what happens between the ropes. And on that front, there would be few who left disappointed. The show could be said to have two main events - one on Saturday and another on Sunday - and the first night's show featured three of WWE's biggest stars. Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins and CM Punk met in a match the company billed as generational, in no small part due to the 46-year-old Punk finally getting to his first WrestleMania main event. The fans were firmly behind Punk to begin with, and the match lived up to the billing - a ferocious war with plenty of big moments and false finishes before a series of twists led to Rollins standing tall. The weekend had kicked off with a feel-good story as Jey Uso defeated Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship, the other major title men battle for in WWE. Jey Uso exploded in popularity in 2024, leading many to believe he would be rewarded with a championship win The more than 60,000 fans in attendance were not disappointed as Uso won his first ever world title to open the show on Saturday - in doing so, bettering the career achievements of his father, 90s and 00s wrestler Rikishi. This was not the only moment celebrating legacy - Dominik Mysterio, the son of WWE legend Rey Mysterio, won the Intercontinental Championship to mark his first ever title in the company. The title changes did not stop there, with the New Day (Xavier Woods and Kofi Kingston) beating War Raiders, and Jacob Fatu winning his first ever title in WWE by defeating the popular LA Knight for the United States Championship. But the big moments were not limited to titles changing hands. It proved to be a massive weekend for WWE's women, who struggled to put a foot wrong across title matches, rivalries and a major return for a fan favourite. First, Becky Lynch, one of the most popular women to ever wrestle in the company, made a surprise return after a year out of action, with her appearance drawing tears from some in the live crowd. Becky Lynch has not wrestled in a WWE ring since 2024 Lynch's return was a winning effort, picking up the Women's Tag Team Championships along with Lyra Valkyria, defeating champions Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez. WWE's fans had already been treated to several excellent matches by this point, with Jade Cargill - who joined a year ago from rival company AEW - beating Naomi on Saturday before Tiffany Stratton faced Charlotte Flair in a fierce fight for the Women's World Championship. Stratton beat Flair to defend her title in what felt like a proverbial handing of the torch from one of the WWE's most decorated champions to the new blood midway through her first title reign. Tiffany Stratton won in a stiff hard-hitting contest Then on Sunday, the live crowd were on their feet for the opener between Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair for the Women's World Championship. Sky was able to successfully defend her title in what was a showcase match for all three women, which some online have already labelled \"an instant classic, external\". But it was not all plain sailing for WWE. While the show was well-received by fans for the in-ring action, one thing that didn't go unnoticed was the quantity of adverts throughout the event. Brand names written on the ring canvas and a sports drink brand synonymous with YouTuber-turned-wrestler Logan Paul, who faced AJ Styles on Sunday, have become a common part of WWE furniture in recent years. But this WrestleMania seemed to pack in the ads far more than previous years, with one fan saying it was, external \"challenging to even focus\" on the action, and another even calling it, external \"Ad-a-Mania\". The adverts were even embedded into elements of the presentation itself, with multiple wrestlers making their way to the ring in special costumes designed to promote video games. And all that's before the ad breaks which split up the event. But it's worth remembering that for those who already had a Netflix subscription, this is the first WrestleMania they won't have had to shell out any extra money to see. While this event is often billed as a showpiece on par with cup finals, there is one big difference - tomorrow, WWE will continue on with the next chapter of its never-ending soap opera. And while the way Netflix bosses feel will come down to pure numbers, fans will surely be happy with what they saw in the ring this weekend. Will WWE's big Netflix gamble pay off at WrestleMania?

        "title": "Prison staff to demand electric stun guns in dangerous jails",
        "content": "Hashem Abedi attacked officers at HMP Frankland in County Durham Prison officers are to demand that staff be immediately given electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding the UK's most dangerous jails when they meet the justice secretary on Wednesday.  The meeting with Shabana Mahmood comes after Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing, threw hot oil at officers and stabbed them with makeshift weapons at HMP Frankland in County Durham. Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the Prison Officers' Association (POA), told the BBC that they are \"calling for the tactical use of taser\".  In a statement, Mahmood said \"we must do better to protect our prison officers in the future\". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Fairhurst said: \"My concerns are that when we face life threatening situations, we no longer have tactical options.  \"If extendible batons and incapacitant spray fail to work adequately, we have no other options available.\"  \"That's why we are calling for the tactical use of taser. We want specially trained staff on site who respond to incidents with the ability to deploy taser to neutralise that threat. \"At the moment we haven't got that.\" Prison officers currently only carry an extendable baton and Pava incapacitant spray - synthetic pepper spray.  The POA will also renew calls for all staff to have stab vests. Mr Fairhurst has also called for American \"Supermax\"-style rules imposed on the UK's most dangerous inmates. This would mean selected high-risk inmates would leave their cell only when handcuffed and escorted by three staff, he told the Guardian, external newspaper.  There would also be no mixing with other prisoners, and they would be restricted to their basic entitlement of rights and privileges. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said there will be a full, independent review into the incident, which has drawn criticism from survivors and the families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing. Former prison governor Ian Acheson said the current protective equipment issued to prison officers, particularly those that deal with the most dangerous prisoners, is inadequate compared to the \"level of threat\" they face.  \"We need some urgent action by the Ministry of Justice to protect frontline staff or we are very close to having a frontline prison officer murdered on duty,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Security measures at the separation centre did allow prisoners access to kitchens - where Abedi carried out his attack - but this has been suspended by the MoJ following the incident.  Abedi has since been moved to London's high-security Belmarsh prison Mahmood said the review would \"provide recommendations and findings that highlight whether there are any changes in process or policies that can be implemented at HMP Frankland and more broadly across the High Security Estate\". An internal review into protective body armour will be also carried out, she said. There was no mention of electric stun guns in the statement. Abedi, who helped his older brother Salman plan the Manchester Arena bombing, was jailed for life with a minimum 55 years in prison after being convicted of murdering 22 people. He had been held in a separation centre - which holds a small number of inmates deemed to be dangerous and extremist - at Frankland. He moved to Frankland after carrying out an earlier attack on prison officers in London's Belmarsh prison in 2020, for which three years and 10 months was added to his sentence. Abedi has since been returned to Belmarsh.

        "title": "Trump tariffs: China slams nations trying to 'appease' US in trade deals",
        "content": "China has warned it will hit back at countries that make deals with the US that hurt Beijing's interests, as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies threatens to drag in other nations. The comments come after reports that the US plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with China in exchange for exemptions to US tariffs. The Trump administration has started talks with trading partners over tariffs, with a Japanese delegation visiting Washington last week and South Korea is set to start negotiations this week. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed hefty taxes on Chinese imports, while other countries have also been hit with levies on their goods. \"Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect,\" a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said, external. \"China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures\". The remarks echoed an editorial last week in the state-controlled China Daily, external, which warned the European Union against trying to \"appease\" the US. The comments came after reports that the US plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure dozens of countries into imposing new barriers on trade with China. The BBC has asked the US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative for responses to the reports. Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced. What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck 'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs \"If you put the numbers on it, about 20% of Japan's profitability comes from the United States, about 15% comes from the People's Republic of China,\" said Jesper Koll, from Japanese online trading platform operator Monex Group. \"Certainly, Japan doesn't want to [have to] choose between America and the People's Republic of China.\" Japan kicked off negotiations with the US last week when its top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met the US President in Washington DC. South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, has said his country will begin trade talks with the US later this week.  Meanwhile, US Vice President, JD Vance, is expected to meet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to the country this week. India faces a tariff rate of 26% if it is unable to agree a trade deal with the Trump administration. Last week, Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK. \"We're certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer's government,\" he said in an interview with the UnHerd website. Since Trump's inauguration, there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs. The US president has said the import taxes will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to major investments in the country. But critics have said bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime. Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements. Just hours after steep levies on dozens of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, he announced a 90-day pause on those tariffs to all countries bar China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\". The trade war between the world's two biggest economies sent shockwaves through the global financial markets earlier this month.

        "title": "Mortgages: Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
        "content": "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people. Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.  We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home. The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is Â£34,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better. A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each Â£4,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra Â£1,000. Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young. \"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up Â£22,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana. \"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of Â£450,000.\" Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country. In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. \"Yorkshire Building Society offers a Â£5,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth. \"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\" However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria. Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest. Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright. \"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes. \"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\" The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all. An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender. While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected. \"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo. \"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\" As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.  The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments. Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income. Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.  For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers. \"Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,\" says David Hollingworth. \"It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.\" But he adds: \"It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.\" Are you looking to get on to the property ladder? Share your experiences.

        "content": " Amin Gulgee finds healing by curating a museum of his murdered father’s work in Karachi Amin Gulgee defies easy categorisation: he’s a metal sculptor, a curator, and one of Pakistan’s most innovative and cherished artists, the beating heart of his home city of Karachi’s creative scene. His metalwork is as dramatic and eccentric as Amin is. He’s in your face, uncompromising, a living and breathing performance piece. Amin also comes from a prestigious family: his father, Ismail Gulgee, was one of Pakistan’s most famous modernists, creating abstract paintings that have been exhibited across the globe, and even sketching heads of state like Reagan and Gaddafi. In 2007, Ismail and Amin’s mother Zaro were tragically murdered by their driver. It was Amin who found their bodies, in their house which adjoins his own studio and gallery. Much of Amin’s work since has been an attempt to come to terms and heal from this most tragic of events. Presenter Harry Stott meets Amin on location in his Karachi studio-cum-gallery-cum-home, as he prepares to open a new museum of his father’s work – the ‘most momentous’ thing he has ever attempted. We listen in as Amin shows us the calligraphy adorned doors which he has created for the museum’s entrance. We go inside his studio to hear about his creative process more widely. And we hear Amin come to terms with the tragedy of his parents’ death and the solace that he finds in his workshop. Amidst the tumult of this momentous museum opening in the already tumultuous city of Karachi, this episode of In the Studio attempts to understand how Amin’s two year process of creation, curation and healing will change his creative process for the years to come.

        "title": "Men's health: Why do men go to the GP less?",
        "content": "Men go to the GP less than women and are less likely to be registered at a dental practice or use a pharmacy Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\". Though he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\" Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection. But \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls. It was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor. His GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis. Dan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" Dan Somers says It's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up. The NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey, external from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days. Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too. They also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments, external than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted. Men are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York. This all affects men's health outcomes. Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play. In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024. Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\". \"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer. \"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds. Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help. \"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham. This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111. \"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says. Kevin McMullan says many men try solve their own mental health problems Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns. Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men. Women, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton. And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says. Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas. And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely, external to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\" For Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool. \"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\" Jonathan Anstee, pictured with his daughters, says he was too embarrassed to talk about his symptoms He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022. Throughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says. Last year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four. Having blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\" In recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up. Matthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023. Matthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\" Through the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together. \"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds. Prof Paul Galdas says men respond better if services are redesigned to meet their needs, like offering focusing on actions rather than talking Experts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done. Prof Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues. \"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says. For Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care.  They're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.

In a statement, the IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces.  The IDF said its investigation found six of the casualties were Hamas members, and rejected that there had been summary executions. In an on-the-record briefing, Major General Yoav Har-Even - who investigated the incident - told journalists that the Israeli military maintained that six of the emergency workers were Hamas operatives and said they would later be named.  The report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly.  It blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances. Another commanding officer \"will receive a reprimand\" for \"his overall responsibility for the incident\", the report added. Journalists invited to Sunday's military briefing were shown aerial footage, shot in the early hours of 23 March, which showed the attacks. The footage also showed several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at.  Israeli officials said this proved troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened. A UN official in Gaza suggested the IDF investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall.  \"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\" Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing. The footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn. The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform. The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra.  The Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident. The IDF's decision to fire a commander and discipline another senior officer is not unheard of - the military dismissed two officers and took action against others after seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen were killed in April of last year. Israel launched its first major operation in Rafah in May 2024, leaving large parts of it in ruins. Tens of thousands of people returned to what was left of their homes in the city during a recent two-month-long ceasefire. Israel renewed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of the ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled. Israel launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

        "title": "RAF Typhoon jets intercept Russian aircraft near Nato airspace in Poland",
        "content": "An RAF Typhoon flies close to the Russian aircraft near Nato airspace Two Russian aircraft flying close to Nato airspace were detected by British fighter jets in separate incidents earlier this week, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said.  A pair of RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M \"Coot-A\" intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea on 15 April, while another two Typhoons intercepted an unknown aircraft leaving the Kaliningrad airspace on 17 April.  The two intercepts, which took off from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing.  They were the RAF's first intercepts since aircraft arrived in the region to begin the defence of Nato's eastern flank, working alongside Sweden. The UK's involvement in Nato's enhanced air policing is called Operation Chessman and sees personnel from across the RAF deployed to Malbork alongside Sweden, Nato's newest member. The undertaking follows Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. Minister for the Armed Forces Luke Pollard said that the UK was \"unshakable\" in its commitment to Nato.  \"With Russian aggression growing and security threats on the rise, we are stepping up to reassure our Allies, deter adversaries and protect our national security through our Plan for Change,\" he said.   Mr Pollard added that the \"mission shows our ability to operate side by side with NATO's newest member Sweden and to defend the Alliance's airspace wherever and whenever needed, keeping us safe at home and strong abroad\".  This is not the first time RAF jets have been used to intercept Russian aircraft.  Last year, two Typhoons based at RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland were scrambled after a Russian Bear-F bomber flew over the North Sea.   At the time, the MoD said the Russian reconnaissance plane had been detected in the UK's \"area of interest\", but had not been able to enter UK sovereign airspace.  Fifty Russian aircraft were also intercepted by RAF pilots based at Lossiemouth in 2023, when 21 aircraft were intercepted in a 21-day period.  In a separate incident in 2023, Typhoon fighters and a Norwegian F-35A fighter aircraft were launched as part of Nato's response to a Russian aircraft near Uk airspace.  Incidents like this - known as quick reaction alerts - are not uncommon and involve RAF crews shadowing Russian military aircraft near UK airspace and during operations further afield, if necessary. They have occurred since the Cold War era. Intercepts are not just used to track Russian aircraft, though. In October 2024, RAF fighters were scrambled to intercept a civilian airliner which had reported a bomb on board.  Afterwards, an RAF spokesman said the alert ended without incident, and the Boeing 777-300 \"was released to continue to its original destination\". How much do Nato members spend on defence?

        "content": "Nairobi National Park is home to animals such as lions, buffalos, giraffes, leopards and cheetahs (stock image) A 14-year-old girl has been killed by a lion on the outskirts of Nairobi, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) said.  The child was snatched from a residential compound on a ranch next to Nairobi National Park, according to the conservation agency.  The alarm was raised by another teenager and KWS rangers followed tracks to the nearby Mbagathi River, where they found the primary school girl's remains.  The lion has not been found but KWS said it had set a trap and deployed search teams to look for the animal.  The agency added that additional security measures had been taken to prevent any further attacks.  Nairobi National Park lies just 10km (six miles) from the city centre and is home to animals such as lions, buffalos, giraffes, leopards and cheetahs. It is fenced on three sides to stop animals roaming into the city but it is open to the south to allow animals to migrate in and out of the area. While lions often come into conflict with humans in Kenya, especially over livestock, it is not common for people to be killed. Last year, CCTV footage captured the moment a lion snatched a Rottweiler dog from another home near Nairobi National Park. KWS also reported that a 54-year-old man was killed by an elephant on Saturday. The incident happened in the central Nyeri county, about 130km (80 miles) north of Nairobi. The elephant was grazing in Mere Forest when it attacked the man, who sustained serious chest injuries, fractured ribs and internal trauma. He was taken to a nearby hospital where he died from his injuries. Paula Kahumbu, head of the WildlifeDirect conservation group, said the deaths were not isolated incidents and urged KWS to improve \"risk assessments and ensure accurate, real-time communication of wildlife movement and behavior, especially in known high-risk areas such as Savannah Ranch,\" where the 14-year-old was killed. She also said that all lodges, camps, and residential developments near areas where wildlife lived should be \"equipped with anti-predator deterrent systems - including lights, alarms, secure fencing, and anti-predator sprays\".  \"Prevention is our first and best line of defense,\" she added.

        "title": "Westminster statues graffitied at London trans protest",
        "content": "A statue of former South African prime minister Jan Smuts was targeted by vandals Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has called the vandalism of several statues in Parliament Square, including one of women's votes campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, \"disgraceful\". Transgender campaigners gathered on Saturday in front of Parliament to protest against the Supreme Court ruling that biological sex defines a woman for the purposes of the Equality Act. Cooper said she welcomed the Metropolitan Police's investigation and that the government would strengthen the law \"to better respect and protect important memorials\". The force said seven statues were damaged and they are investigating the incidents as criminal damage. No arrests have been made. Graffiti on the statue of Dame Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square A statue of former South African prime minister Jan Smuts was graffitied with the words \"trans rights are human rights\". \"Criminal damage like this, including to statues of men and women who fought for freedom and justice like Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Millicent Fawcett, is disgraceful - it is right the police are investigating,\" Cooper said.  \"We are strengthening the law to better respect and protect important memorials. Freedom of speech and protest are important in our democracy, but this kind of criminal damage is completely unacceptable.\" The Met said its officers were in the area policing Parliament Square \"but did not witness the criminal damage take place as the area was densely populated with thousands of protestors and it was not reported at the time\". It confirmed it is investigating the graffiti as criminal damage and has asked anyone  with information, footage or pictures to come forward. The Greater London Authority plans to remove the graffiti but this requires specialist equipment and \"we are confident this will be done shortly,\" the Met added. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\" rather than \"certificated sex\". Protests against the ruling also took place on Saturday in Reading, Edinburgh and Glasgow.  The statue of the women's votes campaigner was unveiled in 2018 Ch Supt Stuart Bell, who was leading the policing operation for the protest, said: \"It is very disappointing to see damage to seven statues and property in the vicinity of the protest today. \"We support the public's right to protest but criminality like this is completely unacceptable.\" A spokesperson for Women and Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson, speaking on the damage to Dame Millicent's statue, said she \"utterly condemns the appalling defacement of such an important national monument to the fight for women's rights\". \"There is no excuse for this disgraceful criminal damage.\" The Met confirmed it is also dealing with a number of complaints from the public about signs and images shared on social media that were reportedly displayed at the protest yesterday and \"action will be taken if there are signs displayed that  breach of the law\". The statue of Dame Millicent by artist Gillian Wearing is the only statue of a woman in Parliament Square, where others honoured include international statesmen like Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, and former prime ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd-George. Unveiled in 2018, it is also the only statue by a female artist in the square, and was erected following a campaign and petition by the feminist activist Caroline Criado Perez. Correction: This article originally said that the ruling means that transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) can be excluded from single-sex spaces if \"proportionate\". However, this is inaccurate and so this line has been removed from the story.

        "content": "This video can not be played Pope Francis wishes the faithful 'happy Easter' from Vatican city Pope Francis has appeared at the Vatican's St Peter's Square to wish \"Happy Easter\" to thousands of worshippers. The Pope, 88, came out in a wheelchair and waved from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica to cheering crowds below, saying: \"Dear brothers and sisters, Happy Easter.\" His traditional Easter address was delivered by a clergy member.  After the blessing, the Pope was driven around the square. As he passed through the crowds, his procession paused a number of times as babies were brought over for him to bless. His appearance on Easter Sunday had been highly anticipated. Last month, he was discharged from hospital after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to double pneumonia. The Pope's Easter blessing, delivered by a clergy member as the pontiff sat looking frail beside him, said: \"There can be no peace without freedom of religion, freedom of thought, freedom of expression and respect for the views of others.\" \"What a great thirst for death, for killing we see in the many conflicts raging in different parts of the world,\" the Pope said in the address. The Pope remembered the people of Gaza, in particular its Christian population, as the conflict \"causes death and destruction\" and creates a \"deplorable humanitarian situation\". Pope appears on Easter Sunday after serious illness Watch: Celebrations usher in the dawn of Easter Sunday In pictures: Easter celebrated around the world from Greece to Iraq He also called growing global antisemitism \"worrisome\". \"I express my closeness to the sufferings... for all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people,\" the message said. \"Call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace.\" The Pope also encouraged all parties involved in the Ukraine war to \"pursue efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.\" Prior to Sunday's celebrations, the Pope had been seen out twice this week. Tens of thousands of Catholics had gathered in Rome for Easter Mass during this special jubilee year, which takes place every 25 years and sees millions of pilgrims descend on the city. The jubilee year kicked off with the Pope opening the usually bricked-up Holy Door at St Peter's Basilica on 24 December. For the first time since becoming pope in 2013, he had missed the majority of Holy Week events, including Saturday's Easter vigil at St Peter's Basilica, where he delegated his duties to cardinals. But, during a brief appearance inside the basilica on that day, he prayed and gave sweets to children. When he was discharged from hospital in March, his doctors had said he would need at least two months of rest at his residence. The pontiff had presented \"two very critical episodes\" where his \"life was in danger\" while in hospital, according to one of the doctors who took care of him. Dr Sergio Alfieri added that the Pope was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented in hospital. Pope Francis, who is from Argentina, has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections. This video can not be played 'I pray for you every day': JD Vance greets Pope Also on Sunday morning, US Vice-President JD Vance - a Roman Catholic who converted as an adult - had a brief private meeting with the Pope. Vance arrived in Rome on Friday, and on Saturday met with the Vatican's Secretary of State and Secretary for Relations with States and International Organisation. During \"cordial talks\" on Saturday, the parties expressed satisfaction with \"good existing bilateral relations\" and a \"common commitment\" to protect freedom of religion, the Vatican said in a statement. \"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement read.

        "content": "DHL Express is suspending deliveries to the US worth more than $800 (Â£603) because of a \"significant increase\" in red tape at customs following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime.    The delivery giant said it will temporarily stop shipments from companies in all countries to American consumers on Monday \"until further notice\". It added that business-to-business shipments will still go ahead, \"though they may also face delays\". Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside Trump's tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered. DHL said that the change \"has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock\". It said that while it is working to \"scale up and manage this increase, shipments worth over $800, regardless of origin, may experience multi-day delays\". The company said it will still deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks. But the White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May when it closes a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties. The removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will impact the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.   Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".       The Trump administration has claimed, external that \"many shippers\" in China \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the US through deceptive shipping practices\". Under an excutive order, the White House said the measures were aimed at \"addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain\" which it said \"play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the US\".  Beijing has said that the opioid fentanyl is a \"US problem\" and China has the strictest drug policies in the world. Last week, Hongkong Post said it was suspending packages sent to the US by sea and, from 27 April, would stop accepting parcels destined for America. It said: \"The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively.\" Shein and Temu warn tariffs will raise prices in US Americans could pay more for these everyday basics under Trump's new tariffs Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "content": "Don Pettit has now spent a total of 590 days in space during his four missions America's oldest serving astronaut Don Pettit has returned to Earth on his 70th birthday. The Soyuz MS-26 space capsule carrying Pettit and his Russian crewmates Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner made a parachute-assisted landing in Kazakhstan's steppe at 06:20 local time (01:20 GMT) on Sunday. They spent 220 days on board the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting the Earth 3,520 times, the US space agency Nasa said. For Pettit - who has now spent a total of 590 days in space - it was his fourth mission.  Still, he is not the oldest person to fly in orbit - that record belongs to John Glenn, who aged 77 flew on a Nasa mission in 1998. He died in 2016. Pettit and the two Russian cosmonauts will now spend some time readjusting to gravity. After that, Pettit - who was born in Oregon on 20 April 1955 - will be flown to Houston in Texas, while Ovchinin and Vagner will go to Russia's main space training base in Zvyozdniy Gorodok (Star City) near Moscow. Before their departure from the ISS, the crew handed command of the spaceship to Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi. The Soyuz MS-26 capsule landed in remote steppe in Kazakhstan Last month, two Nasa astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, finally returned to Earth after spending more than nine months on board the ISS - instead of the initially planned just eight days. They flew to the ISS in June 2024 - but technical issues with the spacecraft they used to get to the space station meant they were only able to return to Earth on 18 March this year.

        "content": "The technology is using human waste to create fuel and a wonder material Technology that can turn sludge from sewage into both hydrogen fuel and the miracle material graphene is being tested in what has been described as a \"world first\" trial in Manchester. United Utilities is working with British climate tech firm Levidian on the project at its Davyhulme sewage works in Trafford.  Under the scheme, the sludge by-product of sewage treatment is used to produce a biogas, that is then turned into graphene and hydrogen using cutting-edge technology. Lisa Mansell from United Utilities said recovering these \"high value\" materials and fuels from the waste could help the provider \"drive down operational cost and ultimately customer bills\". The sludge can be turned into biogas and converted into valuable materials Levidian's conversion process, under way in several containers at the works, sees biogas split using microwave energy into hydrogen gas, which is then fed back into generators to help power the site. Carbon is also generated from this process in its solid form - graphene. Both the water company and Levidian estimate the biogas generated from sewage waste could produce up to 75,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually, enough to fuel more than 40% of all UK bus and coach journeys. In the short-term, United Utilities plans to use the clean hydrogen and graphene to bring down its own carbon footprint. But if successful, the technology could be used across the North West and potentially the entire country. About 50% of all sewage waste in the North West is treated at the Davyhulme site Graphene, a substance said to be the thinnest and strongest ever recorded, was discovered in Manchester twenty years ago, and can be used in a number of ways. These include cutting the carbon footprint of concrete production, boosting the life of tyres, and the performance of batteries.  The works in Trafford, first built in 1894, is one of the largest in Europe, and has pioneered the improvement of the waste treatment process.  \"To be stood here 110 years later to talk about turning sludge into hydrogen or graphene is really really exciting,\" said Tom Lisset, director of Bioresource & Green Energy at United Utilities.

        "title": "Can Reform beat Labour in County Durham's local elections?",
        "content": "Nigel Farage visited County Durham twice in a week ahead of local elections Reform UK leader Nigel Farage says he is parking his party's tanks on Labour's lawns as he senses an opportunity to win a slew of council seats in the local elections on 1 May. Perhaps nowhere would be more symbolic of that boast than winning big in County Durham.  It is the home of the annual Miners' Gala, after all, a parade of working-class pride and heritage that Labour would like to think sums up its traditional values. And it was in a speech in a working men's club in Newton Aycliffe in Durham that Farage made his intention to park his tanks and win over Labour voters clear. It was his second visit to the county in a week and although he has refused to make predictions on how many councillors he may have after polling day, privately some of his candidates are dreaming of getting the 50 wins needed to take control. That would be some advance. The only Reform UK councillors to sit on Durham County Council were four former Conservatives who defected in the dying days of the current council. Former GB News presenter Darren Grimes is standing for Reform UK But this could be a perfect scenario for Reform UK to exploit. Labour is already a wounded beast in County Durham. At the last county election in 2021, the party failed to get a majority in the council chamber for the first time in a century. There were signs of a comeback last July when the party won all six parliamentary seats in Sir Keir Starmer's landslide General Election win, but any feel-good factor disappeared rapidly as Labour lost ground in the polls. Soon it became clear this would be another tough local election year. But Reform UK also has another target - the coalition of Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and independents that has run Durham County Council since 2021. As well as attacking Labour, Reform's leaflets have accused the administration of waste and failure. \"Durham is broken,\" according to the Farage rhetoric. Labour has also been on the attack against the coalition, but Reform UK believes County Durham's traditional loyalties have been shredded. One of their candidates is former GB News presenter Darren Grimes, who has returned to where he grew up to fight for a council seat. \"You could put a donkey with a red rosette on it at one point and it would win,\" Grimes said. \"But no-one I know is voting Labour now. They are in really dire straits because they have neglected voters here for much too long. \"What we are hearing is that we are going to do very well and County Hall better be ready because we are going to get the auditors in and make sure every penny is being spent wisely.\" Councillors Amanda Hopgood and Richard Bell have led the Durham County Council coalition But the different groups running the council believe their track record in the last four years shows they can be trusted to remain in charge. Liberal Democrat Amanda Hopgood has been its leader since 2021, and says the coalition has shown what life after Labour can be like. \"We came in on the back of an unpopular 100 years of Labour control with them not listening to residents,\" Hopgood said. \"What we've done is come in and delivered what we promised. \"We've seen four years of growth as a county, we've got 8,000 more jobs than four years ago and we've delivered investment here at a level never seen before.\" And the council's Conservative deputy leader, Richard Bell, said Reform UK's accusations of waste were nonsense. \"I'm in charge of finance, and although budgets have been very tight over the years, we've looked to make efficiencies, and we've managed to protect frontline services,\" Bell said. \"So I think Conservative councils, or Conservative-influenced councils, are certainly well run.\" The leader of one of the independent groupings that joined the administration said they have also contributed to a successful blend. Councillor John Shuttleworth said: \"When you're an independent person, not tied to any party, you can say your piece and make your own mind up. \"You're not governed by the whip. [The coalition] has worked reasonably well. There have been no fall-outs of any description.\" But Labour has criticised the controlling groups for raising council tax and accused them of failing to invest in the poorest communities.  The party's candidates insist that on the doorstep, the reception is not as hostile as their opponents claim. Group leader Councillor Carl Marshall said: \"I think it's time for change.  \"County Durham can look forward with a bit of optimism to what Labour are going to deliver if we are successful. \"That's going to include tackling issues with off-road bikes, anti-social behaviour, working to bring investment back to our high streets and putting the council back where it should be in the community.\" Another political party looking to make gains - the Green Party- believes it is insurgents and not previous incumbents who are best placed. Their only current councillor, Jonathan Elmer, says it is clear voters are looking somewhere other than Labour for change. \"We know when we ask the question on the doorstep that people are choosing Greens and Reform, and Reform not because they believe in their far-right agenda, but because they are protesting about mainstream politics,\" Elmer said. \"My message is if you elect a Green councillor, that's a sensible protest vote, you're actually getting somebody who's going to work hard week in and week out.\" Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy (left) recently visited County Durham and Councillor Carl Marshall (middle-right) So competition in County Durham is fierce.  Apart from Nigel Farage, the county has also had recent campaign visits from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, Green co-leader Carla Denyer and Labour's Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy. However there is no question that Reform UK is shaking up this race, and has momentum. The party knows strong gains would add to the sense of trepidation many northern \"red wall\" Labour MPs are already feeling. But we have been here before. UKIP and the Brexit Party both threatened to break the mould in the North, but then faded away. There is a confidence about Nigel Farage this time, though, because with both Labour and the Conservatives struggling, he is sitting pretty. But should Reform UK perform as they hope - and actually have to run councils - rhetoric could meet reality. Nigel Farage has promised Elon Musk-style efficiency measures - Doges (Departments of Government Efficiency) for councils - to slash spending and transform local government finances. Council tax payers in places like County Durham would no doubt welcome an end to rising bills, but as anyone who has run a local authority knows, a majority of the money is spent on social care, and room for manoeuvre beyond that is strictly limited. As Labour is finding in government, being the incumbents and facing tough choices is not a recipe for popularity. But we will have to wait till after polling day to see whether Reform UK will move from insurgency to power in Labour's heartlands.

        "title": "Are these Roman remains in Colchester Britain's earliest church?",
        "content": "Archaeologist Adam Wightman says while there is no \"definitive evidence\" the building was a church, a number of clues suggest it was Christians are coming together to celebrate their most important festival, Easter. While the arrival of the faith in England is usually associated with St Augustine's mission from Rome in AD597, its roots go further back. Archaeologists now believe 4th Century remains unearthed in Colchester are probably those of Britain's earliest known church. So what does the evidence say? When it was first unearthed during the Victorian era, it was assumed to be the remains of a Roman temple or shrine. But now archaeologists believe a 25m by 7.5m (82ft by 24ft) Roman building in the Essex city may have a rather different origin. The 4th Century foundations in Butt Road, along with dozens of graves, were first excavated by Victorian archaeologist William Wire, and further digs were held in the 1930s and 1960s. Archaeologists returned in the 1970s and 80s, and made more discoveries, suggesting another way of looking at the finds, external and the building itself. \"It was rectangular, had stone and tile walls and a tiled roof and was aligned east-west, with a curved eastern end,\" says Adam Wightman, director of archaeology at Colchester Archaeological Trust. Experts began to suspect the ruins, just a stone's throw from a major roundabout and the city's police station, were in fact those of a Christian church. The date of the building was crucial, since it was from a time shortly after religious toleration for Christians was established.  Built between AD320 to 340, some archaeologists have suggested it was instead a mithraeum - a sanctuary or temple of the god Mithras Mr Wightman admits there is no \"definitive evidence\", such as the discovery of Christian iconography, that the building must have been a church. \"But you get this wholesale change in burial practice surrounding the building and it's very, very apparent; 61 of the later Roman burials were oriented east-west,\" he says. East-west burials were associated with Christian beliefs that Jesus was expected to return to Earth from the east. Christian churches were also aligned in the same way. \"There is also a lack of the grave goods seen in earlier Roman burials. The Christian belief is the soul goes up to heaven and that you don't need all of this material to take with you,\" adds Mr Wightman. Mr Wightman says there was an abrupt change in burial practices around the building from the 4th Century, suggesting \"Christianity coming to Colchester\" In addition, the graves were laid out \"very, very neatly... much like a cemetery today\". This contrasts with early Roman cemeteries, where people \"just cut across\" the old graves, he says. In the east-west graves, the bodies were buried on their backs, whereas in earlier Roman burials, they were laid out in a variety of positions, including on their sides. Mr Wightman has excavated many Roman cemeteries in Colchester over 20 years Finally, a hoard of more than 500 coins, dating from AD330, was discovered on the site, after the Roman Empire became officially Christian. The building dates from AD320 to 340, was divided by a wooden screen, and seems to have been in use until at least AD400. \"As archaeologists, we're trying desperately as detectives to piece these things together, but there's lots of smaller bits of evidence and it's those weighed together that suggest it's a Christian church,\" says Mr Wightman. Constantine was proclaimed emperor in York in AD306, while still a pagan, eventually becoming sole emperor in AD324 and attributing his success to Christianity Ancient Rome was a pagan empire, believing in a pantheon of gods, which included some of its emperors.  Christians rejected this, arguing there was only one true god, and refused to make sacrifices to the Roman deities.  They remained a small cult, suffering periods of persecution by emperors including Nero (AD54 to 68), Domitian (AD81 to 96) and Diocletian (AD284 to 305) - and while some were \"thrown to the lions\", external, other horrible punishments were more typically meted out.  This changed when the Edict of Milan (AD313), external permanently established religious toleration for Christianity, helped by a soldier called Constantine who attributed his victory in a key battle a year earlier, external to the Christian god. He became emperor (AD324 to 337), proclaimed his conversion and began the empire's evolution into a Christian state.  Colchester - or Camulodunum as it was known - was one of the most important Romano-British towns and had extensive trading links across the empire After the withdrawal of the Roman armies in AD410, Anglo-Saxon settlers from the Germanic lands brought their own pagan beliefs, external. Christianity did cling on in west and north parts of the British Isles, including Cornwall and Wales, but the re-Christianisation of much of England began with St Augustine's arrival, external on a mission from Rome in AD597. It is possible the remains of other Romano-British churches have been found at sites, including St Albans, Hertfordshire, and Lincoln, external. But Colchester is home to some of the best Roman finds in Britain, external, so perhaps it is not surprising that one of these could the foundations of its oldest church.

        "title": "Ed Miliband accuses opponents of net zero carbon emissions 'nonsense and lies'",
        "content": "Ed Miliband said his opponents will make up \"nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda\" Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said the government will \"double down\" on its environmental agenda and accused those against the move to net zero of \"making up nonsense and lies\". Political opponents in the Conservatives and Reform UK - and some trade unions â have argued that his agenda is putting jobs in traditional industries at risk and have urged a change of course. The UK is legally committed to moving to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 â a goal set under a previous Conservative government. Writing in the Observer, external, Miliband warned that an anti-net zero agenda would not only risk \"climate breakdown\" but \"forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future\". A green power transition will help secure social justice and national security, Miliband argued. He said that the UK's reliance on fossil fuels meant \"markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed\" after Russia waged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \"The cost of living impacts caused back then still stalk families today,\" he said.  \"So the argument for the clean energy transition is not just the traditional climate case but the social justice case too â it is working people who pay the greatest price for our energy insecurity.\" On his opponents, he said there are \"siren voices that want to knock us off course\" and added \"they will also make up any old nonsense and lies to pursue their ideological agenda\". Despite her party committing to net zero while in government, current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said this cannot be achieved without potentially bankrupting the country. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has criticised what he calls \"net-zero lunacy\",  told the Sun on Sunday, external that the policy could become \"the next Brexit â where Parliament is so hopelessly out of touch with the country\".  Nigel Farage has been a staunch opponent of net zero Miliband has been concerned that political opponents have been blaming his green policies for the well-publicised difficulties at British Steel, when in fact the trade body UK Steel has said high industrial energy costs are due to the price of gas, and not renewables. The government passed an emergency law to take control of British Steel amid accusations that its Chinese-owner Jingye was planning to switch the furnaces off. Beijing has accused the government of \"politicising trade co-operation\" and said this situation had raised doubts about Chinese investment in the UK. Parts of the labour movement, including unions such as the GMB and Unite, have warned of risks to thousands of well-paid jobs in the oil and gas sector. But Miliband has attempted to reassure them by declaring that green energy generation will provide the good unionised jobs of the future. Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets?

        "title": "Free breakfast clubs to open at 750 schools",
        "content": "Free breakfast clubs are to launch at 750 schools across England next week but teachers have voiced concerns that government funding for the scheme will not meet the cost. From Tuesday, thousands of parents can access half an hour of free morning childcare as part of the trial that will run to July, ahead of an expected national rollout. But teaching unions have raised concerns the funding is too low. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the move would help with \"breaking down barriers to opportunity\". Labour campaigned on a promise of free breakfast clubs in every English primary school and later tripled funding to Â£30m. The scheme will give parents of primary-aged children up to 95 additional hours and save them Â£450 per year in childcare costs, ministers say. Find out which schools are on the list The headteachers union welcomed the expansion of breakfast clubs, which some schools already run, but said schools have suggested the funding is not enough.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"While we welcome the intentions behind the programme, the initial feedback we are hearing from many school leaders participating in the pilot is that the funding just isn't sufficient. \"At a time when school budgets are already stretched, most can ill-afford to subsidise this shortfall.\" He added it was \"absolutely crucial\" the funding is addressed before the scheme is rolled out nationally and it has received assurance from the government the funding would be looked at carefully during the trial.  Teaching union NASUWT said the scheme would make a \"significant contribution\" to tackling child hunger but it needed to be closely monitored to ensure funding issues can be addressed without it impacting other provisions within schools.  Announcing the first 750 schools to join the pilot scheme, the Department for Education said breakfast clubs had \"an important role to play in the government's commitment to remove the stain of child poverty\". Education Secretary Phillipson said: \"Free breakfast clubs are at the heart of our Plan for Change, making working parents' lives easier and more affordable, while breaking down barriers to opportunity for every child.\" Reacting to the upcoming launch of the scheme, shadow education minister Neil O'Brien said the Conservative government supported more than 2,000 schools through its national school breakfast club programme and he criticised Labour for scrapping planned reforms to child benefit. ''Children and their families deserve better,\" he added. Devon tops the list with 25 schools in the programme, followed by England's largest local authority, Birmingham, with 24. Both Wales and Scotland have programmes to provide free breakfasts to children in some primary schools. Guidance sent to schools taking part in the pilot scheme says they will receive a set-up payment to cover equipment and material. Under the scheme, schools will then be reimbursed by the government based on attendance at the clubs - a school with 50% participation in the pilot scheme could get Â£23,000 a year, the government said.

Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of Ãbrego GarcÃ­a, a citizen of El Salvador.  Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of Ãbrego GarcÃ­a. He believes Trump \"could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back\". The protests were generally reported as peaceful, although Representative Suhas Subramanyam, a Democrat, posted a video on X of a man holding a Trump sign and pushing through a crowd to angrily confront him. Many demonstrators carried signs reading \"No Kings,\" a nod to the anniversary of the start of the country's revolution against British rule.  During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday. \"This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,\" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. \"I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.\" A Tesla dealership in Florida Parade goers in Lexington, Massachusetts Trump's popularity appears to be edging down, especially when it comes to the economy. When he took office in January, his approval rating was 47%, according to Gallup. His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day. In the same poll, only 37% approved of his performance on the economy, compared to 42% during inauguration.  Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered for the largest nationwide show of opposition since Trump returned to the White House. Those protests - which were larger than Saturday's - happened in 1,200 locations in all 50 US states.

        "content": "Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts says a number of companies had pulled their advertising over the site's gender discussions Ocado has apologised \"unreservedly\" to Mumsnet for citing \"hateful political views\" when it pulled out of a commercial partnership over the parenting forum's stance on the definition of sex in the Equality Act. Founder Justine Roberts said Ocado \"abruptly pulled out\" of the partnership after Mumsnet called at the last election for the act to be reformed \"to ensure women can access single-sex places\". Ms Roberts said she had \"feared the site might not survive\" because of the number of advertisers which withdrew support over the discussion of gender issues on its forums. Her post came after the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act. Mumsnet's call for reform would have allowed for spaces to be reserved for biological women. Ms Roberts said the forum had also made \"repeated attempts to explain our position - as a platform committed to amplifying women's voices\" but Ocado had \"refused to speak to us\". In a post on X, Ocado said the comments were \"not representative of us as a company\" and that they were made by a \"temporary contractor\" who has since left. \"We apologise unreservedly to Mumsnet,\" the online grocery site added. Ms Roberts wrote her post in a discussion on the forum about the Supreme Court ruling. In the post, she congratulated those on the website \"who played a part in securing what I think most would agree is much-needed clarity in the Equality Act\". The ruling was on a case campaign group For Women Scotland brought against the Scottish government, arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female. Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people. Mumsnet's policy of allowing discussion of gender issues over a number of years had led to intense criticism, Ms Roberts said, adding that the site \"risked being permanently labelled as bigoted, vicious, and 'on the wrong side of history'\". She claimed that a number of organisations had pulled their advertising over pressure from trans activists, both \"internal and external\", threatening the survival of the site. Ms Roberts added the site \"never considered banning discussion of this issue altogether\". Her post only listed one other example, saying Mumsnet had been \"blacklisted on instruction from the top brass at Barclays\". Barclays said it would not comment when approached by the BBC.

Weston-super-Mare's market opened last week and is running every Wednesday at the Italian Gardens close to the sea front. Organiser Michelle Beck told the BBC: \"It's a really fantastic square and the reaction from locals has been really positive.\" There were 44 stalls at the first Weston Independent Market, with traders selling items from house plants, to cakes, to brightly patterned clothes. Ms Beck added: \"I think Weston has been crying out for a regular market for a very long time and we're hoping that it will attract people from all over Somerset and further afield.\" Trader Sean Swords, who runs Your House Plants, at the market's opening Trader Sean Swords from Your House Plants said he was keen to get involved. \"We wanted to support our town and we know markets are a draw â and Weston-super-Mare needs a draw,\" he said. \"The location is spot on â it's just the right area for it, the back of the Sovereign [shopping centre], you're just off the sea front.

It's more sociable and it's more instant â even though you think the internet is instant. \"This is instant because you see it, you like it, you buy it. You know it fits you, you know it looks good on you â job done.\" One trader is selling cakes at Weston Independent Market The market was started as part of Weston-super-Mare Town Council's strategy for 2020 to 2030, which is based on consultations with thousands of locals. Many residents told the council a permanent weekly market was a top priority. Weston's mayor, John Crockford-Hawley, was at the official opening. He said: \"We all know that high streets are not what they were, because shopping has changed. \"Markets are a more exciting way of bringing people in â people just enjoy wandering around markets. \"It's a modern version of a medieval concept.

        "content": "Paltrow won the best actress Oscar in 1999 for Shakespeare in Love and has gone on to become a wellness influencer Gwyneth Paltrow said she has returned to eating food she previously restricted, including sourdough bread, pasta and cheese, having been on a strict paleo diet for several years. The Oscar-winning US actress-turned-health guru has advocated for the benefits of a range of different diets while promoting her lifestyle business. Speaking on her most recent Goop podcast this week, she said: \"I went into hardcore macrobiotic for a certain time, that was an interesting chapter where I got obsessed with eating very, very healthily.\" Paltrow said she got into \"wellness and food\" because of her father's throat cancer but has now broadened out her food choices. A paleo diet is based on the idea that if we eat like our ancient ancestors, we'll be healthier and reduce our risk of certain diseases.  \"I really deepened my connection with food and the whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan, so very local, very seasonal,\" she explained. \"Lots of fish, vegetables, rice, no dairy, no sugar, etc.\" The star went on to admit that during that period of time she \"might have got a little didactic about it.\" \"I felt so good, I wanted to share that with my dad, my friends and family.\" She said she had become \"intoxicated by that idea\" that if she and her loved ones stayed hydrated and ate \"whole foods\" then \"we could just feel so much better\". 10 things you may not know about carbs She added she still feels the same way today, to an extent, but that things had \"gotten a little more complicated\" as she had gotten older regarding \"inflammation and health stuff.\" \"It's the reason that Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little bit sick of it, if I'm honest,\" she added, with reference to her husband Brad Falchuk, co-creator of the Glee TV series. \"I'm getting back into eating sourdough bread, and some cheese - there, I said it. A little pasta after being strict with it for so long. \"But again I think it's a good template, right? Eating foods that are as whole and fresh as possible. I don't think there is any doctor or nutritionist that would refute that, it's a good starting point.\" Priya Tew, specialist dietitian from Dietitian UK, external and media spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said it was \"great to hear\" that Paltrow was \"adding back into her very restrictive diet\". \"This is definitely a good thing,\" she told the BBC. \"Carbohydrates are a vital part of our diets, providing fibre, B vitamins and energy. They are also key for our gut microbiome and also bring taste and enjoyment to meals. \"It sounds like Gwyneth is moving towards a more balanced and nutritious diet, considering her realm of influence it is good to hear that she is finding this of benefit.\" She added: \"Nutrition research shows us that cutting out whole food groups is not good for our overall health. \"We need diversity and variety to help us meet all our nutritional needs, to bring taste into out diets and prevent boredom and to also bring pleasure!\" Having largely stepped away from Hollywood in recent times to focus on health and wellness, Paltrow is set to make her big screen return opposite TimothÃ©e Chalamet in the upcoming sports action movie Marty Supreme.

        "content": "China has called on the US to cancel its sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods entering the country as a sign that the President Donald Trump is serious about resolving the trade war between the two countries. A Chinese official said there had been no trade talks with the US, despite suggestions otherwise from the Trump administration. The trade war between the world's two largest economies has been escalating, with China sending back Boeing planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over tariffs. But Trump has appeared to soften his stance on China, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". A trade war between China and the US is in full swing, with Trump imposing import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US, and China hitting back with a 125% tax on American products. In one of China's strongest statements yet over the tariff war, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said the US should remove all \"unilateral tariff measures\" against China \"if it truly wanted\" to solve the issue. \"The person who tied the bell must untie it,\" he added. Separately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said China and the US had \"not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement\". He added that reports to the contrary were \"false\". Trump previously said negotiations between the countries were \"active\" - but this was also contradicted by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Wednesday they had not yet begun. Bessent added that there was an opportunity for a \"big deal\" between the US and China on trade. He has previously said he expected a de-escalation of the \"unsustainable\" trade war, and said the current situation was \"not a joke\".

The boss of plane manufacturer Boeing revealed China had sent back aircraft it had ordered from the US as part of its retaliation to tariffs. Kelly Ortberg said this week that two planes had already been returned and another would follow due trade tensions between the two countries. China held a roundtable on Wednesday to address the concerns of more than 80 foreign firms over the impact of US tariffs on their investments and operations in China, the commerce ministry said. \"It is hoped that foreign firms will turn crises into opportunities,\" said Vice Commerce Minister Ling Ji.

        "title": "Why Zelensky can't and won't give up Crimea",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula. Those \"little green men\" marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion. The future of Crimea is now at the centre of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognising Russian control of the peninsula. The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognising Crimea as a legal part of Russia - de jure in Latin. For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was \"lost years ago\" and \"is not even a part of discussion\" in peace talks. But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable. Follow latest updates on Ukraine war  In the words of opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko \"territorial integrity and sovereignty is a red line for Ukraine and Ukrainians\". Trump made the point that \"if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?\" Few shots were fired, but Crimea was seized at gunpoint during a power vacuum. Putin later admitted hatching the land-grab in an all-night meeting with his officials days after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was ousted in Kyiv. Unidentified \"little green men\" seized Crimea and it soon became clear they were Russian For a US leader in a hurry to secure a peace deal, Crimea could become a big stumbling block. Trump is correct that there is little chance of Ukraine regaining Crimea in the foreseeable future, and it is in reality - de facto - under Russian control. But that is a far cry from recognising it as legal. Zelensky points to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Pompeo said the US rejected \"Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea\" and pledged to continue until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored. Trump criticises Zelensky over Crimea US intensifies bid to end war Zelensky's implication is that Trump backed Ukraine on Crimea then, and should stick to that now. If a landgrab unrecognised by the international community is approved by the US as legal, what would that mean for international law and the principles of the UN charter? Weeks after Russia's full-scale war began, there was an initial proposal in Istanbul to park the issue so that Russia and Ukraine would aim to resolve it in the next 10-15 years. The idea did not take hold but it was a way of getting over that stumbling block. Trump and Vice-President JD Vance have repeatedly appeared frustrated by Zelensky Zelensky was adamant that he has no power to give up Crimea: \"There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.\" Article 2 of the constitution states that Ukraine's sovereignty \"extends throughout its entire territory\" which \"within its present border is indivisible and inviolable\". Any change to Ukraine's territory has to go to a national referendum, which must be authorised by the Ukrainian parliament. It is not just President Trump that has problems with Kyiv. Russia also sees the Ukrainian constitution as an \"obstacle\" to peace efforts. Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law. Approving Russia's illegal annexation would not just be a red line for Ukraine but would be a terrifying precedent for countries such as Romania that border the Black Sea. The precedent would be felt far beyond the Black Sea. Vladimir Putin staged a concert and a speech in Moscow to mark the anniversary of the annexation of Crimea in 2022 For historical reasons, Russians have long seen Crimea as part of their territory and Putin has spoken of a \"living and unbreakable bond\" with the peninsula, with its Black Sea resorts and balmy summer climate. But Crimea along with the rest of Ukraine voted for independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991. It had the status of autonomous republic within and Kyiv allowed Russia to lease the port of Sevastopol as a base for the Black Sea Fleet. After its annexation in 2014 Putin sought to cement Russia's control over Crimea, first with a 12-mile bridge built over the Kerch Strait in 2018 and then by capturing a land bridge along the Sea of Azov coast in 2022. Putin felt he was righting a wrong inflicted on Russia when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Russia, he said, was \"not simply robbed, it was plundered\". Ukraine in Maps Why did Putin invade Ukraine? Crimea was first annexed by Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great in 1783 and largely remained part of Russia until Khrushchev's decision. Russia and Ukraine were both Soviet republics so it was not a big deal for the Kremlin in 1954. More than half the population of Crimea was Russian, mainly because the original majority population of Crimean Tatars were deported under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944. Tatars were only able to return to Crimea from exile from 1989 as the Soviet Union fell apart, and they now make up about 15% of Crimea's population. Russia quickly organised a referendum in March 2014 but it was rejected as a sham by the international community and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution backing Ukrainian sovereignty. The International Criminal Court ruled that Russia's activity in Crimea amounted to \"ongoing occupation\". Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, has insisted that Ukraine must categorically reject any territorial concession in exchange for peace. \"Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine,\" he said. Trump's peace plan has not yet been published, but according to various reports and remarks by US officials, Ukraine would be required to adhere to other difficult conditions. Russia's occupation of almost 20% of Ukraine would be de facto recognised behind existing front lines, in effect freezing the conflict in four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. That would be backed up by a \"robust security guarantee\", according to US outlet Axios, presumably backed up by a \"coalition of the willing\" involving the UK, France but not the US. There would be a promise not to admit Ukraine into Nato, although it could join the EU. All US sanctions would be lifted and economic co-operation with the US enhanced. Axios also suggests Russia would return a small occupied area of the Kharkiv region and allow Ukraine \"unimpeded passage\" on the Dnipro river, while the US would take charge of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, seized by Russia in 2022. And then there is a US-Ukraine deal to share minerals profits, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to seal with the US by Saturday.

        "title": "Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children",
        "content": "The couple unveiled a memorial in New York The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying \"enough is not being done\". Prince Harry and Meghan unveiled a memorial in New York City which is dedicated to the memory of children whose families believe harmful material online contributed to their deaths.  \"We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,\" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York. \"Life is better off social media,\" he added, saying that he was \"grateful\" that his children were still too young to be online. Prince Harry and Meghan spoke about children and social media \"The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media,\" Prince Harry said at an Archewell Foundation event in New York. \"The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else.\" The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial and is made of 50 smartphone-shaped light-boxes, each displaying a photograph of a child whose life was lost \"due to the harms of social media\". It will be open for 24 hours. The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network. This is a support network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation, for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media. Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children. They have backed calls to technology firms that say parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy. Prince Harry: 'Keep your kids away from social media' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex speak to BBC Breakfast's Jon Kay.  The prince said tech firms were \"getting away with it\" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations. \"You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,\" he said.  Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and \"one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe\". She praised the parents who were speaking out. \"I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" said Meghan. This video can not be played 'You don't know what your children are looking at' warn parents of teen Jools Sweeney Separately to Prince Harry and Meghan's event in New York, a group of British parents staged a protest outside Meta's offices on Thursday. Ellen Roome, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was among the families.  She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022. She says his social media accounts could provide evidence. An inquest into his death found he took his own life. Earlier in the week, Ms Roome told BBC Breakfast: \"It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally. \"There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem.\"  Some parents held their own protest in New York  Mark Kenevan, whose son Isaac died aged 13 in 2022, said: \"All we're asking is... please help us protect our children.\" A coroner ruled that Isaac died as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame. Lisa Kenevan, Isaac's mother, said the families banding together had given them strength. \"Our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,\" she said. The Kenevans filed a wrongful death lawsuit against TikTok in the US earlier this year alongside three other British families. The lawsuit accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online. The firm said it had recently introduced \"teen accounts\" with enhanced protections. \"We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,\" Meta said in a statement. In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended to improve protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.

        "title": "Solihull man discovers he has bought his own stolen car",
        "content": "Ewan Valentine's black Honda Civic Type-R was stolen off his drive on 28 February A man who bought a Â£20,000 car to replace the one he had stolen has discovered he has accidentally bought back his own stolen car. Ewan Valentine, 36, from Solihull, woke up on 28 February to find his car, a black Honda Civic, had disappeared from his drive overnight. After informing police and his insurers, he started looking for a replacement 2016 Type-R model and found one that looked \"identical\" about 70 miles away. But after he bought it, he noticed similar items in the vehicle. It was then Mr Valentine realised he had bought his stolen car - he also found his previous addresses in the car's sat-nav. He told the BBC he was \"gutted\" when his car was stolen, and he was determined to replace it with the same model. The car's mileage display had also been wound back and number plates replaced \"It was sort of a mid-life crisis car, and you don't get many of those, so I was pretty determined to get it replaced before one day I have to get a sort of family car,\" he said. \"I spotted one that was identical, same colour, same year, same slightly obnoxious exhaust system on it as well,\" he explained. \"It fit the bill precisely.\" Mr Valentine paid Â£20,000 for the replacement car at a reputable garage, but upon driving it home, he started to get suspicious. \"I started noticing things in the car were a little bit odd, like a single tent peg and some Christmas tree pines and some, like, Mars bar wrappers and things that they hadn't cleaned out,\" he said. \"All very similar to what you could have found in my stolen car.\" Mr Valentine was \"gutted\" when his car was stolen and he wanted an exact replacement Despite the car having a new number plate and a lower mileage, Mr Valentine's suspicions were confirmed when he later discovered his and his parents addresses in the history of the built-in navigation system. \"I nearly crashed, to be honest, because I was in shock... My hands were shaking; my heart was pounding,\" he said. \"A part of me felt sort of triumphant for a moment until I realised, actually, no, this isn't some heroic moment; you didn't go and get your car back; you've actually done something a bit stupid.\" He took the vehicle to a Honda garage in Solihull and informed the police, who he said could not believe he had \"bought his own car\" and suspected it was stolen to order by unidentified thieves. The deception was uncovered when he found his addresses in the car's sat-nav system \"The first Honda technican. He pulled the physical key out [of the original smart key], puts it straight in the door and unlocks it and he's like, 'Yes, it's your car',\" Mr Valentine said. \"You could see signs where they'd tampered with things and removed VIN numbers and replaced other ones and things.\" Mr Valentine said he believed the garage he bought the car from was also duped, and he now hoped to get his money and deposit back for the vehicle. \"The police and the Honda garage all said this was one of the best clone jobs they'd ever seen, so if it wasn't for these little artefacts, no one would have ever known.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Birmingham and the Black Country Follow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "content": "Armed French officers were seen outside the school on Thursday after four students were stabbed A teenage girl has been killed and three students were injured in a stabbing at a private school in western France. The attack took place at Notre-Dame-de-Toutes-Aides school in Nantes on Thursday afternoon. The attacker is said to have been arrested at the scene after being restrained by a teacher. A significant police presence and emergency services were sent to the school, with army officers also present. It has since been evacuated. Eye-witness accounts in local media described students running through the site, with some confined to classrooms after an alarm was sounded around lunch time.  Families were informed of the knife attack and told students had been immediately held inside the school. Authorities helped students gradually leave the site from 15:30 local time (13:30 GMT), as some parents waited nearby. One father told the Reuters news agency they were \"waiting to hold them [our children] in our arms\" and \"help deal with the stress this will have caused\". The school has around 2,000 students and educates pupils from nursery through to high school, according to its website.  Psychological support has been put in place for students and teachers. Rue des Ãpinettes, where the school is located in the east of the city, has been closed off. There was a large police presence at the Nantes school French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed the casualties on X later on Thursday, and praised teachers at the scene. He wrote, external: \"By their intervention, the teachers undoubtedly prevented further tragedies. Their courage commands respect.\" After the attack, Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Bayrou urged \"an intensification\" of checks for knives in schools. National and local politicians visited the school after the attack, where Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told reporters: \"This tragedy is not a news item, it is a social phenomenon.\" He added that the \"psychological profile\" of the suspect was not known. Nantes public prosecutor Antoine Leroy is said to have visited the school and will hold a news conference in the coming days.

        "content": "A presidential spokesman described the killings as a âheavy lossâ Benin's government has admitted that 54 soldiers were killed by suspected jihadists in the country's north last week near the borders with Burkina Faso and Niger.  The authorities had previously said that only eight soldiers were killed.  The revised figure makes it the deadliest known attack since insurgents began operating in northern Benin at the beginning of the decade.  The attack has been claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked group - Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, (Jnim), which is based in Mali but has in recent years expanded its operations to neighbouring countries. The jihadist group had said it killed 70 soldiers in raids on two military posts in the north, according to intelligence group SITE. Jnim is one of several jihadist groups operating in West Africa's Sahel region, especially Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military governments are struggling to contain the insurgency. Benin and Togo have seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south. \"Heavy losses for the nation,\" wrote presidential spokesman Serge Nonvignon in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Another government spokesperson, Wilfried Leandre Houngbedji, said that Benin was determined to continue the fight against the jihadists. \"We won't give in... I can assure you that sooner or later, sooner or later, we will win,\" he said.

While less well-known than his contemporaries Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, his popularity has increased among philosophers in recent years. Merleau-Ponty rejected Rene Descartes’ division between body and mind, arguing that the way we perceive the world around us cannot be separated from our experience of inhabiting a physical body. Merleau-Ponty was interested in the down-to-earth question of what it is actually like to live in the world. While performing actions as simple as brushing our teeth or patting a dog, we shape the world and, in turn, the world shapes us.

        "title": "Tanzania bans South Africa and Malawi imports as trade row escalates",
        "content": "Tanzanian traders have been ordered to halt all shipments to South Africa and Malawi A normally bustling border crossing between Tanzania and Malawi was noticeably quieter than usual on Thursday as a result of an escalating regional trade row. From midnight, Tanzania banned the entry of all agricultural imports from Malawi and South Africa in response to what it sees as restrictions on some of its exports. South Africa has for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania. Malawi last month blocked imports of flour, rice, ginger, bananas and maize from its northern neighbour. \"We are taking this step to protect our business interests... in business, we must all respect each other,\" Tanzania's Agriculture Minister Hussein Bashe said on Wednesday, confirming the ban.  Diplomatic efforts to resolve the trade issues have so far failed but Bashe said fresh talks were ongoing.  The row comes at a time when Africa is supposed to be moving towards greater free trade through the establishment of a continent-wide free-trade area, which began operating four years ago. South African exports of various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania will be hit. Meanwhile, landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods. Trump's tariffs could be death knell for US-Africa trade pact Africa is important to Trump, despite aid cuts, envoy tells BBC Malawi's ban on the import of certain produce, announced in March, was designed as a temporary measure covering goods from all countries to protect local producers, according to the authorities in Lilongwe.   \"It is a strategic move to create an environment where local businesses can thrive without the immediate pressure of foreign competition,\" Malawi's Trade Minister Vitumbiko Mumba said at the time.  Tanzania's agriculture minister said Malawi's move had \"directly affected\" his country's traders and described the restrictions as \"unfair and harmful\". While confirming the import ban, Bashe assured Tanzanians that it would not threaten their food security. \"No Tanzanian will die from a lack of South African grapes or apples,\" he said, adding that, \"we are taking these actions to protect Tanzanian interests\".   Neither South Africa nor Malawi have commented on Tanzania's move. Empty lorries were seen at the Tanzanian side of the border with Malawi on Thursday morning  At the Kasumulu crossing, through which most Tanzania-Malawi trade passes, only a handful of lorries transporting cargo such as fuel were spotted on the Tanzanian side. On a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the frontier, drivers told BBC. On the Malawian side, many lorries that should be transporting bananas and tomatoes through Tanzania were parked and empty. \"[The drivers] are now trying to find alternative products to transport. It's been very difficult for them because they are used to carrying agricultural goods, and now they can't carry not just bananas and tomatoes, but even maize and potatoes,\" Happy Zulu, a business person, told BBC. Trade flows between Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa - all members of the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional political, security and economic body - were already being affected last week. On Saturday Bashe posted a social media video showing a pile of rotten bananas, external in a truck stranded at the border with Malawi, saying it was hard for Tanzania  to tolerate the trend.  Tonnes of tomatoes also spoiled at the border recently after lorries from Tanzania were denied entry into Malawi. Malawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures. But while Tanzania can seek alternative markets such as in Kenya, Namibia and South Sudan, landlocked Malawi may find it harder to get its goods out of the country. Much of its exports go through the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, as well as essential imports such as fuel and machinery. Losing access to Dar es Salaam would likely force Malawi to move shipments through the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala - options that may be more expensive. Bashe argued the ban was not meant to provoke a trade war but to protect Tanzania's interests.  \"Tanzania will not continue to allow unequal market access to persist at the expense of its people,\" he said.

        "title": "Zelensky cuts short South Africa visit after Russian attack on Kyiv",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has said he is \"not happy\" with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and that President Vladimir Putin should \"stop\" - but has not said if further action might be taken against Russia.  Overnight into Thursday, the attacks on the Ukrainian capital killed at least 12 people and injured 90 others. The US president said he is \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war in Ukraine, following the deadliest attacks Kyiv has seen since last July. It is the latest road bump in efforts to advance a peace deal between the two countries - something the US president said he would be able to quickly do as part of his election campaign last year.  In rare criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social: \"Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!\" The attack has come at a time of growing pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky to accept Russian occupation of its territory as part of a peace deal.  On Thursday, Trump appeared alongside Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr StÃ¸re at the White House and said he had \"no allegiance to anybody\" only an \"allegiance to saving lives\".  While he admitted frustration with Putin, Trump said he would wait a week \"to see if we have a deal\" - but that \"things will happen\" if the bombings do not end. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Putin in Moscow later on Friday. President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the attacks during a visit to South Africa, saying he felt the US could be more forceful with Russia to secure a ceasefire. South Africa and Ukraine woo each other - as relationships with Trump turn sour \"We believe that if more pressure is applied to Russia, we'll be able to make our positions closer,\" Zelensky told reporters.  When asked if he would be willing to make any concessions, Zelensky said the fact that Ukraine is prepared to negotiate with Russia at all is a \"huge compromise\" and a \"ceasefire must be the first step\". \"If Russia says it is ready to cease fire, it must stop massive strikes against Ukraine. It is Ukrainians who are running out of patience, because it is us who are under attack, and no one else,\" he added. The attack caused Zelensky to cut his trip short and return home. In an interview with CBS's Face the Nation TV programme, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military\".  Lavrov provided no evidence to back his claim. He added that some elements needed to be \"fine tuned\" for Russia to agree to the US-proposed peace deal. Zelensky met with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria Before the attack on Kyiv, the week had seen a fraying of the already imperilled relationship between Trump and Zelensky - as the US president has suggested the need for Ukraine to make land concessions as part of a peace deal.  On Wednesday, Trump claimed a deal to end the war was \"very close\", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms \"will do nothing but prolong\" the conflict. Ukraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. On Wednesday, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would \"freeze the territorial lines [...] close to where they are today\", and added that Ukraine and Russia \"are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own\". Trump criticises Zelensky as Ukraine refuses Russian control of Crimea When asked by reporters at the White House this week about whether the administration was looking to recognise Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end. Recognising Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea would not only be politically impossible for Zelensky to accept, it would also be contrary to post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by force. \"We've shown them the finish line,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday in the Oval Office, where he appeared alongside Trump and the Norwegian prime minister. \"We need both of them to say yes, but what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.\" President Zelensky's visit to South Africa, during which he met President Cyril Ramaphosa, signalled a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations. Ramaphosa said during a news briefing alongside Zelensky that he was deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He also reiterated South Africa's commitment to speaking to all parties in the conflict. He added that he had spoken to both Putin and Trump on the need to bring an end to the conflict.  Ramaphosa, in the briefing, did not go into whether Ukraine should cede territory to Russia.  The US was one of Ukraine's closest allies until the re-election of Trump in November. Now Ukraine is keen to broaden its pool of international partners - particularly in Africa where many countries have strong links with Russia. South Africa has also suffered from strained relations with Washington, which has expelled its ambassador and removed aid funding. South Africa says its non-aligned position puts it in a prime position to help bring about a peace deal with Russia.

        "title": "Dad and son write song for Pennine Way 60th anniversary",
        "content": "Jon and Ben Avison say the Pennine Way is a \"pilgrimage\" for many A father and son have recorded a song to mark the 60th anniversary of the opening of England's first national trail. The 268 mile (431km) Pennine Way runs from the Peak District, across the Yorkshire Dales, and ends in the Scottish borders. Singer-songwriter Ben Avison and his father Jon, who both live in the Yorkshire  Dales, said their song, Making Memories on the Pennine Way, was all about their personal history and connection to the trail. Jon Avison, a former ranger and deputy chief executive of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, said the song reminds him of the \"passion\" he has for the area. \"The Dales is home for me, it's where I come from, I'm rooted here,\" he said. Ben's earliest childhood memory is helping his father Jon build the steps at Malham Cove Ben is a musician and songwriter whose music, a blend of folk and alternative styles, aims to capture the connection between people and landscapes. \"I grew up in Kirkby Malham, on possibly the most celebrated section of the Pennine Way,\" he said. \"My earliest memories are of the towering cliffs of Malham Cove and Gordale Scar, and the bleak expanse of Malham Moor. \"The landscapes you grow up in shape who you are.\" The Pennine Way was partially inspired by similar trails in the USA The original idea for a national trail came from Tom Stephenson, a British journalist and keen walker, who wrote an article in 1935 asking for a long distance walk in England - a long green trail, partially inspired by similar routes in the United States. It was 30 years before his idea became a reality when Mr Stephenson, by then secretary of the Ramblers' Association, attended the official opening of the Pennine Way at Malham Moor on 24 April 1965. The trail runs from Edale, in the northern Derbyshire Peak District, north through the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland National Park, before reaching its end at Kirk Yetholm, just inside the Scottish border. The Avison's say the song relfects the \"enduring beauty\" of the trail Ben said the trail was a \"pilgrimage for so many\". \"It's a journey that offers both challenges and rewards, much like life itself.\" He said the song had been inspired by the landscape and his relationship with his father. It aimed to \"honour\" the experiences of walkers and the trail's \"enduring beauty,\" he said. \"It celebrates the Pennine Way as a place of reflection, inspiration, and connection, whether you're local or a visitor.\" Jon's former band, The Moonbeams, also released three albums of songs celebrating the Yorkshire Dales and he said creating the song had been a bonding moment with his son. \"I have spent most of my working life caring for and encouraging others to care for the beautiful Yorkshire Dales,\" he said. \"This song and video reminds me of the passion I have for the Dales and brings back wonderful memories of sharing that passion with Ben.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire Listen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.

        "content": "It is the latest truce since the rebels stepped up an offensive in eastern DR Congo The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have agreed to halt fighting in the east of the country until peace talks mediated by Qatar reach their \"conclusion\".  It is the latest truce since the rebels stepped up an offensive in eastern DR Congo where authorities say 7,000 people have been killed since January. Both sides on Wednesday jointly announced to work towards peace following more than a week of talks, which they described as \"frank and constructive\".  Last month, Congolese President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame also reaffirmed their commitment to an \"unconditional\" ceasefire in a surprise meeting in Doha.  The decades-long conflict has intensified since January when M23 staged an unprecedented offensive, seizing Goma and Bukavu - eastern Congo's two largest cities - and sparking fears of a wider regional war. DR Congo accuses Rwanda of arming the M23 and sending troops to support the rebels in the conflict. Despite assertions from both the UN and US, Rwanda has denied supporting the M23. What's the fighting in DR Congo all about? The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo Rwanda has said its forces are acting in self-defence against the Congolese army and allied militias, some of which it accuses of links to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. DR Congo also accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda denies. In a joint statement released separately by the M23 and Congolese government on Wednesday, each side pledged to give peace talks a chance.  \"By mutual agreement, both parties reaffirm commitment to the immediate cessation of hostilities, a categorical rejection of any hate speech, intimidation, and call on all local communities to uphold these commitments,\" they said in a statement read on Congolese national TV and and posted on X by the M23 spokesperson, external Lawrence Kanyuka.  They said the ceasefire would apply \"throughout the duration of the talks and until their conclusion\". Sources in the Qatar talks told Reuters news agency that the outcome of the meetings were almost derailed by \"technical\" issues.  It is not clear how long the truce will hold as several ceasefires have been agreed since 2021, before later collapsing. Belgium's Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevot termed the truce a \"crucial step towards ending the violence\", external.   Qatar has been mediating between the two parties after the rebels refused to attend peace talks in Angola last month.  The Congolese government had long refused to hold direct talks with M23, branding it a \"terrorist\" group.

        "title": "Ukraine war: Russian attacks on Kyiv kill nine as Trump accuses Zelensky of preventing peace",
        "content": "Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Moscow is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the US to end the Ukraine war, although some elements need to be \"fine-tuned\" \"The president of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" he tells CBS, the BBC's US partner Meanwhile, Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to hold talks with President Putin in Moscow later In Ukraine, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has suggested the country may have to give away territory as part of any peace deal with Russia Three people have been killed, including a child and a 76-year-old woman, in the latest Russian drone strike on Ukraine This video can not be played Watch: At the scene of devastation after strike on Kyiv Edited by Rorey Bosotti and Nathan Williams This video can not be played As we wait for more information on Witkoff's visit to Moscow, we can bring you more on those comments from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that we posted about earlier. Lavrov has been speaking to CBS's Margaret Brennan on the Face the Nation programme, where he says  the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the US on Ukraine. He is also challenged about this week's missile strikes on Kyiv which left 12 dead. Lavrov insists Russia \"only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military\". US special envoy Steve Witkoff's plane has landed at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow after travelling from Florida, two Russian news agencies are reporting. Witkoff is expected to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin today to continue talks on a Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Details of the meeting have yet to be confirmed by either the White House or the Kremlin. As we've been reporting, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin today. The prospective meeting comes after the US president criticised both Ukraine and Russia. Here's a quick look at what he has said: When Trump wanted someone to meet Russian President Vladimir\nPutin in February to open negotiations for a potential deal to end the\nRussia-Ukraine war, he didn't dispatch his secretary of state. The man he sent to the Kremlin to handle a titanic\ngeopolitical challenge does not even have a diplomatic background. Steve Witkoff was one of Trump's first picks for his top\nteam after his presidential election win in November. Trump wrote: \"Steve\nwill be an unrelenting voice for PEACE, and make us all proud.\" As a long-time Republican donor, he has known Trump for\ndecades, and, like the president, made his fortune in real estate in both New\nYork and Florida. Witkoff's deal-making skills were on display during Trump's\n2024 campaign, when he helped ease tension between Trump and his defeated\nRepublican presidential primary rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. He currently serves as chairman of the University of Miami's\nbusiness school real estate advisory board, and was appointed by Trump during\nhis first term to the board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the\nPerforming Arts. A plane that took off from Florida has entered Russian airspace, multiple local state-run agencies report citing public flight data. The Bombardier Global 7500 aircraft crossed over the Russian border at 09:40 local time (07:40 BST). It comes as US envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to meet Putin today to continue talks on a Russia-Ukraine peace deal. As we continue to report on attacks on Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says Russia is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the US to end the war, although some elements need to be \"fine tuned\". Speaking to BBC's US partner CBS News, Lavrov adds: \"The president of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction.\"  Asked what made it worth killing civilians after Ukraine had said in March that it's ready for a ceasefire, Lavrov says \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military\". Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring Three people including a\nchild and a 76-year-old woman have been killed in a Russian drone attack on the\ntown of Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk region. Regional governor Serhiy\nLysak says 10 people were injured and shares pictures from the scene suggesting\na residential apartment block was hit. Ukraine's air force says Russia launched 103 drones in\novernight attacks, which killed three people. The fatalities were reported in Pavlohrad, in Ukraine's eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.  Posting on Telegram, regional governor Serhiy Lysak says: \"The aggressor again massively attacked the region with drones... several fires also broke out in Pavlohrad.\" Ukraine's north-eastern city of Kharkiv also came under attack with its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, saying several private buildings were damaged.  Russia fired no missiles at Ukraine overnight,\nUkraineâs air force adds. Witkoff and Putin during talks in St Petersburg earlier this month. White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to hold talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow later today to discuss a possible peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Witkoff, a former real estate developer, has already met Putin three times over the last two months. Earlier this month, Donald Trump's special envoy suggested a potential peace deal hinged on the status of five Ukrainian regions.  Witkoff appeared to be referring to Crimea and the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions in eastern Ukraine, much of which are under Russian military occupation after Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022 with the aim of taking control of the whole country. The Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, says it's up to Ukraine to decide the terms of any peace deal with Russia. It comes after US President Donald Trump accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of harming peace negotiations by ruling out recognising Russian control of Crimea. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Starmer says: \"It's Ukraine that must decide on those issues, it's not for other people to decide on behalf of Ukraine.\" The PM also describes Zelensky as courageous and says he was not to blame for being unable to find a solution to end the war.  The mayor of Ukraine's capital Kyiv says the country might have to give up some of its territory, albeit temporarily, in order to secure a peace agreement with Moscow. It's the first time a senior Ukrainian official has seriously broached the idea after President Volodymyr Zelensky's repeated dismissals. \"One of the scenarios is to give up territory,\" he tells BBC Radio 4's Anna Foster. \"It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution.\" Ukraine finds itself under extraordinary pressure from the US and the Kremlin to accept concessions of land and rights to mine its vast mineral deposits.  This week, US Vice-President JD Vance added to that pressure, saying that a peace deal would need to \"freeze\" territorial lines \"close to where they are today\". But Klitschko admits he doesn't have a seat at the table that would make such a decision.  \"It's not my function,\" he says. \"It's the function of President Zelensky.\" Good morning and thank you for joining us as we resume our Ukraine coverage.  Yesterday, in a rare criticism of Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump said he was  \"not happy\" with deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv that left 12 dead on Thursday -  but he didn't say if further action might be taken against Russia. However,  efforts to achieve a truce continue, with Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, expected to hold talks with Putin later today. On the Ukrainian side, concessions are being considered by high-profile politicians.  The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko,  tells the BBC his country may have to give away territory as part of any peace deal with Russia.  He says such a settlement would be unfair, but could be a temporary solution to end the fighting. Here in the UK,  the Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, says it's not for him to say if he would accept a peace deal that defined Crimea as part of Russia.  Stay with us as we follow the day's events. Overnight in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Russian strikes killed at least 12 people and left dozens injured, in the deadliest attack on the capital since last July.  The strikes came hours after US President Trump accused Ukrainian President Zelensky of harming the negotiations and \"prolonging the killing field\".   In Ukraine, the strikes left parts of Kyiv flattened - we heard from one resident, Tanya, who says: \"Kyiv keeps on living, attacks like these make people stronger.\" Zelensky made a plea for more pressure to be placed on Russia and said \"Putin has no fear\". As the day progressed, world leaders reacted to the attacks. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP!\" Later on, Trump said the he has his \"own deadline\" for peace talks, adding that the US is putting a lot of pressure on Russia and Ukraine, but he refused to give specifics. We're now pausing our live coverage, for more on this story: It's been 55 days since the colossal fallout between Zelensky and Trump in the Oval Office Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko says Kyiv and\nWashington have made progress on the long-awaited minerals deal, but it will not be finalised this week.  The proposal is thought to be a co-owned cash pot which would receive 50% of the profits from Ukraine's critical minerals, as well as oil and gas. The money would then be invested in the country's recovery. The latest memo on the deal says US and Ukraine \"intend to establish a reconstruction investment fund as part of an economic partnership between the two peoples and governments\". It does not include the promise of a security guarantee from the US, something Zelensky has pushed hard for throughout negotiations It's almost two months since President Zelensky first travelled to the US to finalise this deal. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte says the ball is \"clearly\" in Russia's court, after meeting President Trump at the White House.  \"There is something on the table now, I think, where the Ukrainians are really playing ball,\" Rutte tells reporters.  \"And I think the balls are clearly in the Russian court now, he adds.  Before Russia launched its overnight attacks, US President Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations. Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring The head of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis, a body representing the indigenous population of the annexed Ukrainian region, has rejected suggestions to recognise it as part of Russia. âCrimean Tatars categorically reject attempts to recognise Crimea as Russian territory, no matter who makes them,â Majlis head Refat Chubarov said. He also told Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform that any deals on Crimeaâs status reached without the involvement or agreement of Ukraine and the Crimean Tatar people would be illegitimate. Chubarov is currently in New York attending the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. Together with thousands of Crimean Tatars, he fled Crimea following its annexation by Russia in 2014. Dozens of members of the Crimean Tatar community have since been jailed by the Russian authorities, often on dubious charges of extremism seen as Russia's revenge to the community that has generally opposed the annexation. In 1944, Stalin deported almost all Crimean Tatars to Central Asia in what Ukraine recognises as an act of genocide. They were only allowed to return home in the late 1980s. Abdujalil AbdurasulovUkraine reporter As we've been reporting, Crimea has been a point of contention in peace talks for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Donald Trump has recently accused\nUkraine of failing to defend Crimea in 2014. It's true that Ukraine\ndidn't put up armed resistance to Russian soldiers at the time. But they made\nthat choice because they wanted to avoid a full-scale invasion and the kind of\nwar weâre seeing now. Russia moved to take Crimea\nduring a power vacuum in Ukraine. President Yanukovich had fled, and law\nenforcement was demoralised. At a Security Council\nmeeting in February 2014, acting defence minister Ihor Tenyuh said the\nUkrainian army was virtually destroyed by the previous administration and\nwarned against open confrontation with Russian troops. Council members argued that\nany use of force would give Moscow an excuse to invade more of Ukraine. Ukrainian leaders hoped not\nfighting back might appease Russia, but soon realised this only encouraged the\nKremlin to seize more territory. Because of such painful\nexperience, today Kyiv insists on having âsecurity guaranteesâ as part of a\nlong-lasting peace deal with Russia. This video can not be played \"My hands are still shaking\": Kyiv resident reacts to attack Back on the ground in Ukraine now, and the Ukrainecast team have been speaking to Vitalii Pashchenko, a student in Kyiv who got caught up in Russia's strikes on the Ukrainian capital. He describes the emotions he felt following the attack, including \"a sense of the loss that the entire nation is experiencing on practically a daily basis.\" You can hear the full interview in the latest episode here. Gary O'DonoghueSenior North America correspondent Donald Trump declined earlier on to say what specific pressure he's putting on Vladimir Putin in peace negotiations. But, according to reports, the White House is working on a seven-point plan that has already been rejected by President Zelensky. The plan would require enormous concessions from Ukraine, including on Crimea -  which is a huge red line for Kyiv. In fact, the first Trump administration was very clear that Russia illegally annexed Crimea and that shouldnât have happened. There are also big concerns around Russia keeping parts of provinces that itâs occupied during the war - which would effectively freeze the frontlines where they are . Again, this is something that would be incredibly hard for Ukrainians to accept. There are some issues that remain for Moscow too. For example, Russia would not want to hand over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which it currently occupies, to the US. There are also questions around whether the Russians will be happy with Ukraine joining the EU-  even if itâs prevented from joining Nato. These are not small concerns in any negotiation, and even President Trump - despite his optimistic tone today - canât wish those issues away in a short period of time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claims \"Russians used a ballistic missile manufactured in North Korea\" in the strike on Kyiv, according to \"preliminary information\".  In a post on X, Zelensky says if this is confirmed it will be \"further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang\". \"They kill people and torment lives together â that is the only meaning behind their cooperation,\" he says. Zelensky says no country \"should be left alone to face such threats\" and calls for \"real pressure on Russia to stop this\". He says the fact that strikes continue amid international diplomatic efforts shows \"Putin is not afraid\". Copyright Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

        "content": "About 80 million packets of chocolate digestives are made each year at McVitie's factories across Stockport and London  The boss of the biscuits factory where McVitie's chocolate digestives have been made for the last 100 years reckons people have always eaten them incorrectly. Anthony Coulson, general manager at the company's chocolate refinery and bakery in Stockport, said the teatime staple was originally meant to be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down. \"It's the world's most incredible debate, whether you have the chocolate on the top or the chocolate on the bottom,\" mused Mr Coulson, who admitted he was a chocolate-on-top man.  The factory opened in 1917, with the chocolate digestive launched eight years later. About 80 million packets are made every year, with all of the chocolate made in Greater Manchester.  Mr Coulson told BBC Radio Manchester: \"One of the very first things I learnt when I  got to join McVitie's was chocolate side down to eat the digestive. \"Now, up until then, I'd always eaten it the other way round... You can do it exactly how you want to do it.\" This video can not be played \"It makes sense\" to eat the biscuit chocolate side down, Mr Coulson tells BBC Radio Manchester Mr Coulson said the theory was \"it starts to melt, you start to get the flavour and away you go\", adding: \"It makes sense, right?\" The chocolate digestive was launched about a quarter of a century after the plain variety, whose name was inspired by the belief that the baking powder in the recipe would help with digestion.   Its creation came two years before one of the food manufacturer's other famous brands, the Jaffa Cake, which itself has become something of a confectionery conundrum. And although people might think of the chocolate digestive as being topped with chocolate, the company has said that as the plain biscuits pass through a \"chocolate reservoir\", the chocolate actually coats the underside of it.   The firm's factory in Stockport opened in 1917 Lynn Loftus, who has worked at the factory for 36 years, called the biscuit \"timeless\", adding that she thought it would be around for many years to come. Craig Leech, who has worked at McVitie's for 21 years, started off in the factory by putting the chocolate on the biscuits. \"I just come in with a positive attitude. I know the people and the products inside out,\" said Mr Leech, who is now a planning manager for the refinery. Alix Knagg, who has been working there for six months, said the chocolate digestive was \"still a great product 100 years on\".

        "content": "The swan that died was one half of a mating pair which recently laid a number of eggs Authorities are investigating after a nesting swan was found dead in a park. The body of the bird was found in Albert Park, Middlesbrough, on 12 April and removed from the area by officers from Defra. It was part of a pair and the remaining swan is trying to keep their eggs incubated on its own - a role usually divided between the parents. Defra has not commented on claims locally the bird had been attacked by a dog. The ongoing investigation is trying to establish the cause of death. The gender of the swan has not been confirmed. The remaining swan has sat on the eggs to keep them warm Seth Elliott, who has lived next to the park for three years, described how it had been a \"really sad day\" discovering that one of the swans had died. He said: \"When spring comes round and people are actively out around the park more, it's exciting to see all the birds nesting.  \"My son loves to feed the birds and we go most days to walk our dog so it's been a noticeable change.  \"The remaining swan really seems to be trying alone - we've seen it turning its eggs and sitting on the eggs. We just hope the brood will thrive against the odds.\" A Middlesbrough Council spokesperson said it was awaiting results from Defra \"about the cause of the swan's death\". Defra confirmed it was \"looking into\" the death as part of its wild bird surveillance programme. Follow BBC Tees on X,, external Facebook, external, Nextdoor and Instagram, external.

        "title": "Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping as residents protest",
        "content": "Public criticism of Hamas is rare, with protests violently dispersed and opponents jailed, tortured and killed - this protest took place in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza on 26 March \"Out! Out! Out!\" The voice in the Telegram video is insistent. Loud. Sometimes musical. And the message unambiguous. \"All of Hamas, out!\" On the streets of Gaza, more and more Palestinians are expressing open defiance against the armed group that's ruled the strip for almost 20 years. Many hold Hamas responsible for plunging the tiny, impoverished territory into the worst crisis faced by Palestinians in more than 70 years. \"Deliver the message,\" another crowd chants, as it surges through Gaza's devastated streets: \"Hamas is garbage.\" \"The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip,\" says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former organiser of the 2019 anti-Hamas \"We Want to Live\" movement.  Al-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him. \"The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,\" he said. \"We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. \" Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March. \"To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,\" he wrote, \"not Palestinian freedom\". Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him. \"We need to take a risk and speak out,\" he replied without hesitation. \"I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.\" Moumen al-Natour says Hamas can no longer stay in power in the Gaza Strip Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts. \"Humanity demands that we raise our voices,\" al-Natour said, \"despite suppression by Hamas\". Hamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics. At the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City. Hours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds. The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death \"a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing\". Oday al-Rubai's family blames Hamas for his killing Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice. Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him. \"Gaza has become a city of ghosts,\" he said, glancing over his shoulder. \"I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.\" At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza. Amin Abed, a long-term critic of Hamas, was beaten by masked militants in Gaza last year. He now lives in Dubai Last summer, Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas. Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad. Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished. \"Hamas' power has begun to fade,\" he told me. \"It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.\" Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power. But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war. Some of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas. Hundreds gathered in Beit Lahiya for last month's protest, with people chanting anti-war and anti-Hamas slogans Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition. In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness â who asked not to be named â described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community. On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan. \"They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,\" the eyewitness told us. \"But he refused.\" The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out. \"They were not intimidated by the bullets,\" the eyewitness said of the protesters. \"They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.\" Hundreds join Gaza's largest anti-Hamas protest since war began Hamas faces growing public dissent as Gaza war erodes support Elsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes. But such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead. With little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas. Asked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was \"a choice between cholera and the plague\". The protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Dads David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar on why they're running the London Marathon Two dads whose daughters were killed at a dance class in Southport last year have told the BBC how their children will be with them in spirit as they run the London Marathon. David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar are raising money for projects established in their daughters' memory. Alice Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died last July while they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop. Mr Aguiar tells BBC Breakfast he talks to Alice when he's running alone. \"I tell her to keep going with me, that we're going to do this together, you're going to be with me - always.\" Mr Stancombe says his daughter would be very proud of his efforts. The pair had watched coverage of the marathon on TV last year and she told him he should run the race in honour of her grandmother. Southport dad runs for Elsie's 'legacy of hope' Playground appeal for Southport victims hits Â£250k \"A little bit of me was like, 'oh yeah, alright Els,'\" says Mr Stancombe. \"I just never thought I would be running it for these reasons.\" Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, will both be at the marathon to support the pair, on Sunday.  \"It is just incredible what they are both doing,\" says Mrs King. \"And we want to be a part of it every step of the way.\" The dads are raising money for projects commemorating the lives of Elsie, Alice and Bebe Mrs King says it is important to the couple that they are at the roadside as they want to represent their daughter while David and Sergio, who are running in honour of their girls, are cheered towards the finish line. \"They were such wonderful, caring little children,\" she says. \"Even though none of them knew each other, they were all so similar. And I reckon they are just up there watching over us and looking out for us.\" Mr Stancombe is raising money for Elsie's Story, a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young people and support others in the Southport area. \"I keep saying Elsie and those other girls will live longer than us,\" says her mum, Jenni Stancombe. \"Elsie's Story and the work that we're doing in the community will continue [her legacy].\" She says the grants are for \"causes that will bring joy, happiness and support to children... Elsie wouldn't want it any other way\". Mrs Stancombe says she chokes up at the thought of David crossing the finish line and imagining what their daughter's reaction would have been. \"She'd be shouting from the line, you'd hear her above everybody else,\" she tells us. \"She'd take his medal off him straight away.\" David Stancombe says he can't imagine what he will be like when he finishes the marathon but wants to enjoy it Mr Stancombe says around 40 friends and family will be in London to cheer him on, all wearing hoodies and t-shirts featuring the Elsie's Story logo. \"I've seen so many videos of people crying at the end of the London marathon and I can't imagine what that will be like,\" he says. \"But I want to enjoy the day. I want to do it for me and I want to do it for Elsie.\" Mrs Stancombe is certain her husband will complete the marathon, having witnessed his resilience and determination during training. \"I have absolutely no doubt, but I know it will be Elsie who'll be the one to carry him over that finish line.\" The 26.2 mile (42 km) route finishes on The Mall in central London and, like David, Mr Aguiar is committed to reaching it. \"Twenty-six miles, I've never done anything like that before. But for my girl, I would do 26 or 50 - whatever,\" he says. \"The pain doesn't matter, I'm going to do it.\" Sergio Aguiar says he talks to his daughter when running alone and tells her they will do the marathon together He is raising money to build a new playground, including a performance stage and library, at Churchtown Primary School, where Alice was a pupil. It will be dedicated to Alice and Bebe, who previously attended the school. Alexandra Aguiar, Alice's mum, says her daughter would have loved to see \"her friends play on the playground that [bears] her name\". \"The fact her name will be overlooking the playground forever, that would make her feel special,\" she says. \"And [I'm sure it's the] same for Bebe.\" Mrs King agrees, saying the new playground is a fitting tribute. \"It's really special that all [Bebe's] friends from that school will have this lasting legacy of her,\" she says. \"She'd be over the moon that she could bring some happiness to her friends and the kids of Churchtown.\" Ben and Lauren King will be at the marathon representing Bebe as they cheer on David and Sergio Ms Aguiar also feels her daughter will be accompanying her dad in spirit during the marathon. \"She's always with us. And she's going to be there helping daddy.\" She says she knows how Alice would have celebrated his efforts: \"She would have made a big thing of it and told everyone. She would also bring her shopping list to do after the marathon!\" Running alongside Mr Aguiar will be Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School. She says she has been struck by his courage to run and focus on the playground project. \"His determination [and] his resilience give me so much strength,\" says Ms Payne. The project, she says, is ultimately about Southport remembering the girls. Mrs Stancombe and Ms Aguiar will be at the marathon to support their husbands. However, both say it will be their daughters - not them - who helps them cross the finish line.

        "content": "The meme coin is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump The price of Donald Trump's cryptocurrency has soared after the US president promised to host two special events for its top investors. The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the \"most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world.\" According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (Â£42.40) reached shortly after its launch in January. The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the \"crypto president\". As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be \"an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President\" for the top 25 coin holders, the coin's website said. Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2.5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January. The move was criticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it \"a stunt\". The invitation on the meme coin's website First lady Melania Trump also launched a cryptocurrency on the eve of the inauguration. Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture. Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations. He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies. Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings. This week, Trump's media company announced, external plans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs). The financial products to be launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a \"Made in America focus\". ETFs are investment funds that hold multiple assets. They can be bought and sold in a similar way to shares.

        "title": "Exhausted hospital staff putting patients at risk, says watchdog",
        "content": "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.  The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals. It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents. In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.  In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed. In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures. The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".  Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis. And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\" The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work. Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue. The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue. It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.   Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.  \"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\" Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite. She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.  But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too. A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care. \"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added. He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff. Do you work in the NHS?

        "title": "Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky meets South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa to counter Russia",
        "content": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has ended an historic visit to South Africa, signalling a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations.  The visit marked a diplomatic breakthrough for the Ukrainian leader in his efforts to counter Russia's strong - and growing - influence in Africa. \"I'm sure that Russia will be annoyed by the visit, but I don't think it can do much about it,\" said Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Relations think-tank.  But Russia disrupted Zelensky's visit by carrying out an air strike on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, forcing him to announce that he will cut short the trip by returning home immediately after meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa. The South African leader said the visit had \"reaffirmed\" the bonds between the two nations, pointing out that Zelensky's visit was the first in 33 years by a Ukrainian head of state. Apart from a brief stopover in Cape Verde in 2023 while flying to Argentina, this was also Zelensky's first visit to Africa since he became Ukraine's president in 2019. Ukraine grasped the diplomatic significance of African states, when many of them - including regional powerhouse South Africa - refused to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion of its territory in 2022.  \"Ukraine neglected the continent in terms of foreign policy, but it has changed that over the last three years, doubling its embassies from 10 to 20,\" Mr Gruzd told the BBC.  \"But it's in a very crowded space - Russia, China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates are all trying to increase their influence in Africa.\"  Zelensky's visit to South Africa at this point was especially significant, as Ukraine's relationship with the US - its main weapons supplier - has soured since President Donald Trump took office in January.  He briefly paused military aid, denounced Zelenksy as a \"dictator\", and has accused Ukraine of being responsible for the war.  \"Ukraine needs every bit of legitimacy it can get internationally - not just in Europe.   Wars aren't only won in the battlefield, but also in courts of public opinion around the world,\" said Prof Siphamandla Zondi, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg.  For South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, the visit was equally significant, as his country, too, was under intense pressure from the Trump administration.  \"The US has turned diplomacy on its head,\" Mr Gruzd said, adding: \"Everyone is looking for new friends.\"  The war has led to heavy casualties and widespread destruction Ramaphosa saw Zelensky's visit as an attempt to boost his credentials as a peacemaker, saying their talks focused on efforts to reach a \"comprehensive peace\".  The South African leader also held a phone conversation with Putin ahead of Zelensky's visit. \"We both affirmed the strong bilateral relations between our respective countries,\" Ramaphosa said in a post on X, external.  \"We further committed to working together towards a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,\" he added. Ramaphosa first tried to assume the role of peacemaker in 2023 when he led a delegation of African leaders to both Kyiv and Moscow in an attempt to mediate an end to the conflict.  The initiative came as South Africa faced a backlash from then-US President Joe Biden's administration, which questioned its professed neutrality in the conflict after it held a naval exercise with Russia and China. Relations worsened after Washington's then-ambassador to Pretoria accused South Africa of supplying arms and ammunition to Russia. Ramaphosa later appointed a judge-led inquiry to investigate the allegation. It found no evidence to back up the ambassador's claim, but relations between South Africa and the Biden administration remained strained. South Africa's ties with Russia have not been a sore point for Trump, as he too gets along with Putin and has been pushing Zelensky to make a deal with the Russian leader. However, Trump's relationship with South Africa has reached rock bottom over its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and for what he calls the \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white-minority Afrikaner community - an allegation Ramaphosa's government denies.  Prof Zondi said South Africa would have to ensure that Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky did not hurt its attempts to mend relations with the Trump administration.  \"South Africa will want to explain that it is adding to the efforts to build peace, and its role is not in competition with that of the US,\" he added.  Ramaphosa was on cue, announcing on Thursday that he had spoken to Trump about the conflict in Ukraine. Crucially, Ramaphosa also seized the opportunity to discuss relations between South Africa and the US, and said he and Trump had agreed to meet soon.  This would be their first meeting since Trump's return to office, and Ramaphosa will be hoping that US-South Africa relations get back on track. Earlier this month, Trump announced a 30% tariff on South African goods, although he later paused the hike for 90 days.  Ramaphosa will be hoping that their talks lead to Trump softening his stance, as such high tariffs would be a major blow to South Africa's economy. Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky also focused on strengthening trade ties with Ukraine, as South Africa's economy was in crisis, with low growth and high unemployment. \"Any volume of trade, no matter how small, is critical for South Africa,\" Prof Zondi said, adding that strong relations between the two nations could also benefit Ukraine in its efforts to extend its influence on the continent. \"South Africa could be Ukraine's gateway to Africa because of its ports and financial systems,\" Prof Zondi said.  If this happens, it would mark a new chapter in Ukraine-Africa relations, though not necessarily at the expense of Russia. \"Both Russia and Ukraine are the biggest exporters of cereals to Africa. Africa needs both. It cannot be expected to choose sides,\" the analyst said.

        "title": "'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day'",
        "content": "Chris Brookes-Smith no longer lives in fear of eating the wrong thing Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut. Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory. \"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\" His voice tails off, full of emotion.  \"I thought I was going to die.\" Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.  \"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says. But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\". It took Chris days to recover from his worst allergic reaction, in 2014 Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.  As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse. An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious, external. Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.  Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".  Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences. Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy. As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life. It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react. Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up. In the trial, patients were started on tiny amounts of peanut powder to slowly build up their tolerance Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts. By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris. Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\". \"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that. \"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\" The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift. \"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"  This trial, published in the journal Allergy,, external shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times. Medical help was always on hand when Chris upped his dose of peanut during the study Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine. \"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"  But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction. \"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\" However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring. Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is. \"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\" Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food. How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people. And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result. Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay â as recommended by his doctors. He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment. While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life. \"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\" Early peanut butter can give lifelong allergy defence Give babies peanut butter to cut allergy - study Children with peanut allergies improving - trial Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.

        "title": "India closes main border crossing with Pakistan after Kashmir attack",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: First responders on the scene after gunman opens fire on tourists at Pahalgam India has announced measures targeting Pakistan, a day after 26 people were killed by gunmen at a Himalayan tourist attraction in Indian-administered Kashmir.  They include the closure of the main border crossing linking the two countries, the suspension of a landmark water-sharing treaty, the expulsion of diplomats and an order for some Pakistani visa holders to leave within 48 hours. Pakistani officials, who have denied the country's role in the attack, are meeting on Thursday to come up with a response, its foreign minister said. The attack in Pahalgam was one of the deadliest in recent memory for the restive region - and is threatening to aggravate already icy bilateral ties. India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but control it only in parts. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought wars over the territory. The Indian government has responded furiously to the attack and has signalled it holds Pakistan indirectly responsible. India has long accused successive governments in Islamabad of supporting armed groups in the region, which Pakistan strongly denies. \"Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X. \"Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and it will get even stronger.\" India also said it would suspend the Indus Water Treaty - a treaty that has been in place since 1960 and survived decades of hostile diplomacy.  The treaty gives India control over the eastern rivers, and Pakistan the western ones, of the Indus river and its tributaries. The agreement stipulates that India must, with few exceptions, allow water from the western rivers to flow downstream into Pakistan. Indian security agencies believe a group called the Kashmir Resistance was behind the attack, though BBC News has not independently verified that. A manhunt for the gunmen responsible was continuing on Wednesday evening.  Pakistan's government said its National Security Council - the country's highest military and security body - would meet on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, the Pakistani foreign ministry said it was \"concerned at the loss of tourists' lives\" and expressed condolences.  Under the measures announced by India on Wednesday, Pakistani military advisers based at the Delhi embassy were told to leave immediately, and more diplomatic expulsions are planned for next week, a statement said. The Pahalgam attack risks reigniting long-running tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals.  Earlier, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also signalled India's response would go beyond targeting the perpetrators.  He said: \"We will not only reach those who have perpetrated this incident but also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to commit such acts on the soil of India.\" The attack has been widely condemned by international leaders and has generated outrage and mourning in India. Eyewitnesses have described chaotic and bloody scenes as holidaymakers including entire families fled for their lives.  Some witnesses said it appeared the gunmen targeted non-Muslims but others have described the shooting as random.  Most of the victims were Hindu men, though a local Muslim man was among the victims. \"We cannot get over the fact that such an incident has occurred, and that too in the place we call heaven on earth,\" Akib Chaya, a hotel owner and a member of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce, told BBC's Newshour.  \"Tourists have been coming to Kashmir since the last three or four decades and they have never been touched.\" India's government has not given an official account on whether people were targeted on the basis of religion.

        "title": "Bites on gladiator bones first evidence of combat with lion",
        "content": "The skeleton of the young man was found during a 2004 dig in York Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say. The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery. Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion. Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats. \"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said. \"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\" The bite wound was confirmed by comparing it to sample bites from a lion at a zoo Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis. Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death. \"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\" As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.  \"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.   The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death. The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\" Fictional depictions of gladiatorial combat with big cats have featured in films such as Gladiator starring Russell Crowe The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones. Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts. Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\". Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".  His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat. Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\" Malin Holst said the discovery was \"hugely exciting\" The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.  Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.  The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.  David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\" Branded merchandise can boost ROI and brand loyalty for Yorkshire companies - learn how Identical twins from York to run London Marathon in memory of loved ones 5 photos that show how this popular York street has changed over the decades Archbishop of York joins Anglican delegation at Pope Francisâs funeral in Rome Police swoop after incident in York park Woman attacked stranger because she was in a bad mood, court told Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "content": "A Boeing 737 MAX 8 intended for a Chinese airline is returned to a Boeing airfield, as trade tensions escalate over US tariffs on Chinese imports China has sent back planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over Trump tariffs, the boss of aircraft maker Boeing has said. Kelly Ortberg said two planes had already been returned and another would follow after trade tensions between the two countries escalated. Boeing's chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them. The US put 145% tariffs on imports from China and it hit back with a 125% tax on US products. A Boeing 737 MAX 8, the second jet intended for use by a Chinese airline to be returned to its manufacturer, flies mid-air before landing at Boeing Field. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs he had imposed would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\". However, Mr Ortberg said China \"have in fact stopped taking delivery of aircraft because of tariff environment\". Boeing is America's largest exporter with about 70% of its commercial aircraft sales outside of the US. Mr Ortberg said Boeing was assessing options to re-market 41 of the already built planes to other customers as there was high demand from other airlines. He said there were nine planes not yet in Boeing's production system and he wanted to \"understand their intentions and if necessary we can assign to other customers\". He added Boeing was \"not going continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them\".  Later in the afternoon, Mr Ortberg told an investor call \"there is not a day that goes by that we're not engaged with either cabinet secretaries or either POTUS himself (President Trump) regarding the trade war between China and the USA.\" He added he was \"very hopeful we'll get to some negotiations\". On Wednesday, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference there was an opportunity for a \"big deal\" between the US and China on trade. Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an \"incredible opportunity\" to strike an agreement, if China was \"serious\" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports. Mr Ortberg also told investors others in the Boeing supply chain were now exposed to tariffs - mainly in Japan and Italy where universal tariffs of 10% are being implemented. Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer said during the call \"free trade policy is very important to us\" and Boeing will continue to work to with suppliers to ensure continuity. Boeing has reported smaller losses for the first quarter of the year after it manufactured and delivered more planes. Production had slumped in 2024 due to a series of crises and a strike by about 30,000 American factory workers. It wants to increase output of its 737 MAX jets to 38 a month in 2025.

        "title": "Rachel Reeves signals UK could lower US car tariffs in push for trade deal",
        "content": "This video can not be played Chancellor Reeves says she wants to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduce Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports as she tries to broker a trade deal with the Trump administration. Reeves said she wants \"to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US\". The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports. One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these. Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.  The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal. President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US â including from the UK. The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies â most of which are currently on pause until July. UK negotiators are working \"flat out\" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington. \"We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event. Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK. Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\". But she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\". \"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added. Reeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\". \"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said. Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s. The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones. Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\". He said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations. \"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said. China sends Boeing planes back to US over tariffs Trump hints at softening China tariffs and says no plan to sack Fed boss US growth forecast to be hit hardest from Trump tariffs, IMF says Trump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs. These include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products. The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets. Prices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs. The IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest. On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\". Reeves signalled the UK may lower levies on US car imports However, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\" She said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\". She added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\". This, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said. This mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May. It is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties. The removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant. Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\". The UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.

        "title": "Coachella: Kneecap say statements 'not aggressive' after criticism",
        "content": "DJ PrÃ³vai from Kneecap performing onstage at Coachella on 11 April The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at a call for their US visas to be revoked after their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages. Writing on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio \"took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements\". When asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: \"Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.\" The festival's organisers have also been approached for comment. Kneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances. Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza? Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. The number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures. Kneecap member Mo Chara wore a keffiyeh scarf - a symbol of Palestinian identity - during the band's performance on 18 April Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÃ , Kneecap's manager said: \"If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.\" Daniel Lambert added: \"Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.\" He also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as \"too severe to get into\". In a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that \"may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted\". The band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months. Sharon Osbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent On Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included \"projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech\". \"This band openly support terrorist organizations,\" she added. Ms Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). \"Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,\" Osbourne said. \"However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,\" she continued. \"This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,\" Osbourne said. \"I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,\" she said. Osbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent. She also managed her husband's solo career. Osbourne finished her post by saying: \"As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved. \"I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.\"  The festival organisers have been approached for comment. Warning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive At the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, the band projected a message: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\" At the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text. The first message said: \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,\" followed by: \"It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,\" and a final screen added: \"[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.\" During the performance, band member Mo Chara said: \"The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go. \"The Palestinians have nowhere to go.\" The band also led the audience in chants of: \"Free, free Palestine\". On 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland. A US State Department spokesperson said: \"Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.\" They said the Trump administration \"is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process\". \"When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,\" they added. \"This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.\" Call for Kneecap's US visas to be revoked after Coachella Badenoch blames 'cowardly' Labour for Kneecap settlement Kneecap wins first Bafta but misses out in five categories Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Live updates: Harvey Weinstein New York rape retrial begins after original verdict overturned",
        "content": "Disgraced ex-Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein's retrial begins today after his landmark 2020 rape conviction in New York was overturned  He is being re-tried on charges of rape and sexual assault, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to 23 years in prison back in 2020. He has pleaded not guilty But the state's court of appeals found he did not get a fair trial because women who were allegedly abused by Weinstein were allowed to testify against him despite not being a part of the charges Weinstein also faces a new charge of allegedly sexually assaulting a woman in a Manhattan hotel in 2006. He denies any wrongdoing  Weinstein is behind bars on a separate conviction for raping an Italian model and actress in a Beverly Hills hotel in 2013 Edited by Jenna Moon with Madeline Halpert reporting from court Imogen JamesLive reporter Opening statements from both sides have finished and the court has taken a lunch break. Here's what happened so far in the retrial of ex-Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The prosecution The prosecution outlined claims of three women this case is focusing on: Miriam Haley, Kaja Sokola and Jessica Mann.   Haley and Mann's allegations were heard in the 2020 trial, where Weinstein was convicted. But that conviction was later overturned by the court of appeals. Sokola alleges Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006 when she was 19.  The prosecutor, Shannon Lucey, called Weinstein a \"Hollywood gatekeeper\" who held \"unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry\".  The defence Arthur Aidala told the jury that after they hear the evidence, the case âis going to fall flat on its faceâ. Aidala suggested the women were not taken advantage of. Weinstein's lawyer claimed the acts were consensual, and that the women believed the producer could advance their careers. He told the court that many of the women continued to see Weinstein after the alleged sexual assaults. We're now finishing our live coverage. You can read New York reporter Madeline Halpert's coverage of day one of Harvey Weinstein's retrial here. Thanks for joining us. We have another glimpse inside the New York courtroom to share with you. Artist Jane Rosenberg sketched Harvey Weinstein as he watched his lead attorney Arthur Aidala during opening remarks. Earlier, we saw sketches of prosecutor Shannon Lucey and Justice Curtis Farber. Madeline HalpertReporting from court Both sides have finished their opening statements, which lasted roughly two hours. Aidala is continuing to try to cast doubt on the women's claims because they stayed in contact with Weinstein after the alleged assaults.  He claims Jessica Mann did not tell her agent and her friend who were waiting downstairs minutes later that Weinstein allegedly raped her.  âThere was chemistry between Jessica and Harvey,\" Aidala says.  The women, he argues, were after money and wanted to use Weinstein for his fame and power.  âThese women are addicted to that fame,â Aidala says. âThey want to be heroes.â Weinstein's defence attorney has just pointed out lawyer Gloria Allred, who is sitting in the public space in the courtroom.  Allred is a prominent women's rights attorney. She's represented several women who were victims of Harvey Weinstein.  She was the lawyer for Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, in the trial that saw Weinstein's now-overturned conviction in 2020. Haley is one of the accusers again in this trial.  She also represented victims during the Los Angeles trial.  Allred is currently representing claimants in the UK case against former Harrods boss Mohammed al-Fayed, and previously represented victims in the case of singer R Kelly.    Madeline HalpertReporting from court Aidala is accusing the three women of lying for money.  He says the women were put in contact with lawyer Gloria Allred, who Aidala says is âknown for suing celebsâ.  Prosecutors mentioned that some of the women received settlements from civil suits against Weinstein over the alleged abuse.  He gestures to Allred, who is sitting behind reporters in the back row of the courtroom today, looking dismayed by his remarks. Aidala is now using a metaphor related to a circus, when he is interrupted by the judge, who says \"I'm not sure where he's going with this.\"  Prosecutor Shannon Lucey points to former film producer Harvey Weinstein during opening statements Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg watches as former film producer Harvey Weinstein is wheeled into court before state Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber Madeline HalpertReporting from court Aidala is attacking the three women who have made accusations against Weinstein.  He is using some of the alleged victim's claims against them, including that Polish model Kaja Sokola - who alleges Weinstein assaulted her at age 16 - has had her struggles.   Sokola, Aidala says, is âtroubledâ.  âSheâs got a lot of problems,â he says, attempting to cast doubt on her claims, noting that she wrote Weinstein kind text messages later. Madeline HalpertReporting from court Aidala is not denying that Weinstein had sexual relations with the women, but is instead suggesting that the sexual acts were consensual, calling them Weinsteinâs âfriends with benefitsâ.  âThe casting couch is not a crime scene,â Aidala says.  Weinsteinâs lawyer admits that it was âimmoralâ for Weinstein to cheat on his âgorgeousâ wife with the women. But, Aidala claims, it was wrong âon both endsâ.  Aidala claims there was nothing stopping one of the women from running away from Weinstein during their encounter in the middle of the day. Aidala points out that many of the women continued to see Weinstein after the alleged sexual assaults.  âSheâs taking her rapist to have lunch,â Aidala says of one of the women. Madeline HalpertReporting from court Aidala starts by outlining his clientâs extensive Hollywood credentials.  Weinstein is watching his lawyer from his wheelchair as Aidala walks around the court, delivering his opening statement with frequent hand gestures.  He tells jurors that they do not have the full story about his client.  âWhat youâre going to learn about all three of these women is that they realized very quickly, Harvey Weinstein, heâs got the key to that room they want to go to,â Aidala says. âNone of them have the qualifications to get into that room.â  âThey want him to like them when they need it,â Aidala says, claiming the women were âflirtatiousâ and that âthey wanted\" Weinstein.  Madeline HalpertReporting from court in Manhattan We're back from a short recess, and it's now to Weinstein's lawyers to deliver their opening statement.  Weinstein's attorney Arthur Aidala paces as he talks to jurors, introducing himself to them.  \"Folks, after you hear all the evidence, their case is going to fall flat on its face,\" he tells them. \"They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense.\"  While we wait for more details to emerge from opening arguments at Weinstein's rape and sexual assault retrial in a Manhattan court, let's take a look back over how we got here.  You can read many more dates and details in our in-depth timeline. Madeline HalpertReporting from court Lucey is now telling jurors about the âprofoundly psychologicalâ and âphysicalâ hold Weinstein had over his alleged victims.  Weinstein âdefined the fieldâ of acting, she says.   The three victims âkept their shame and their pain to themselvesâ for years because of his role as a film mogul, Lucey says.   But, she says, that all ended in October of 2017, when the New York Times published its investigation into Weinsteinâs alleged sexual abuse and harassment.  The story led dozens of women to come forward with their own allegations against Weinstein, galvanising the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.  Then, Lucey says, the three victims âsuddenly realized they were not aloneâ. Mann (centre) reacts outside of court as Weinstein was handed his now-voided prison sentence in 2020 Actress Jessica Mann is one of the original accusers in this case.  She took Weinstein to court for rape and sexual assault. She's been very vocal about her allegations against Weinstein.  Mann, now 39, is an actress, known for starring in Fantasy Tales, This Isn't Funny and Asylum: Twisted Horror.  Her latest work was released in 2020.  Madeline HalpertReporting from court Prosecutors are now introducing the third woman at the heart of this case, Jessica Mann.  Mann met Weinstein around 2012, when he allegedly expressed interest in her acting career. During a business meeting in a hotel restaurant with Mann, Weinstein directed waiters to bring their food upstairs to a private room because they were being interrupted too much.  In the room, Lucey says, Weinstein asked her to take her shirt off so he could give her a massage. She declined. Weinstein then asked Mann to give him a massage, to which she agreed, Lucey says. Mann left after this interaction, Lucey says.  Lucey recounts a later meeting in March 2013 that Mann had scheduled with Weinstein in a hotel lobby. Weinstein was using a fake name to book a hotel room. He later led Mann to the room. She tried to avoid going in, but Weinstein pushed her inside, Lucey alleges.  He asked her to take off her clothes, but she refused, the prosecutor alleges. He kept pressuring her until Mann found herself on a bed, lying there while Weinstein raped her, Lucey alleges.  Later, Weinstein allegedly told Mann: \"I just couldn't help myself.\" Madeline HalpertReporting from court During the first hour of opening statements, Lucey has attempted to prep jurors about potential concerns that may arise during the accusersâ testimony.  The prosecutor has been transparent that at times, some of the women were not prepared to come forward about their story, and some of the details may be fuzzy for them as they recall a traumatic incident.  Lucey has said that during some of the alleged assaults, even if the women didnât âkickâ or run or scream, they only didnât do so because they did not think they could safely get away.  Madeline HalpertReporting from court Years later, after speaking to Weinstein from time to time, Weinstein tried to grab Sokola's breast when she was in a car with him, the prosecutor says. She told him no and got out of the car, Lucey says.  As Lucey gives her opening statement - often delivering graphic details of Weinsteinâs alleged assaults - jurors look closely at the prosecutor with their arms crossed, appearing to concentrate on her words.  In another incident, Lucey alleges, Sokola had a meeting with Weinstein, where she found herself trapped in a room with the defendant. Weinstein pushed her onto the bed and forcibly performed oral sex on her, the prosecutor alleges.  During the incident, Sokola cried and said over and over \"please don't do this\", Lucey says. Lucey claims that after the incident, Weinstein said to the Polish model: \"See, that wasn't so bad.\"  After the incident, Weinstein allegedly recommended her to an elite acting studio, though she struggled to land gigs and moved back to Poland. We are now hearing from the prosecution about Kaja Sokola. She's the third woman bringing forward sexual misconduct allegations in Weinstein's retrial - she didn't participate in the previous trial. She alleges Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in 2006. She was just 19 at the time and is reported to be the youngest accuser speaking out. A former model, Polish-born Sokola now is an advocate, psychologist and producer.  Madeline HalpertReporting from court Lucey is now introducing a second woman who has brought claims against Weinstein, Kaja Sokola, an actress and model who was born in Poland and sent to live in New York city alone when she was a teenager, Lucey says.  Her parents were focused on her becoming a modelling success.  She found her way into the acting business after promoters recruited her, with the Weinstein company later contacting her to talk about her \"acting potential\", Lucey says.  Sokola was later taken in a car to meet Weinstein for what she thought was a business meeting. Upon meeting her, Weinstein took her up in an elevator into an apartment with a bedroom.  Lucey says Weinstein told Sokola to âtake off her shirtâ. Lucey says Sokola thought the request was just a normal part of the acting business.  Weinstein then proceeded to sexually assault her and force her to perform sexual acts on him, Lucey says. Sokola was just 16 at the time. Since the alleged assault, Sokola has suffered from an eating disorder, substance abuse and other mental health issues, the prosecutor tells jurors.  Weinstein has been looking at his lawyers or straight ahead for most of the opening statement.  Madeline HalpertReporting from court Prosecutor Shannon Lucey says that from the first time Haley reported that the defendant raped her, she had no plans to sue.  She didnât even think she had the option because it happened in 2006, and it was now 2020, Lucey says.  Ultimately, before the criminal case against Weinstein was brought, Haley was awarded $475,000 for her claim that Weinstein raped her in exchange for releasing him for any civil liability, the prosecutor says.  Haley - who testified in the first Weinstein trial - does not want to do so again, Lucey says.  \"It is traumatising to relive and repeat the details\" of the incident, she says. \"She is afraid and paranoid about the defendant's power.\" Copyright Â© 2025 BBC.

        "content": "Benson Boone's hit Beautiful Things was streamed two billion times last year Benson Boone scored the world's most popular song of last year with Beautiful Things - but that success has come with a backlash. The US singer has now sent a message to his haters, asking them to make their criticism more constructive. \"If you hate me or my music at least have a good reason for it,\" the 22-year-old wrote in a message on TikTok, external. \"I just read a comment that said 'idek [I dont even know] why I hate Benson Boone but it feels right.' Like WHAT!? how am I supposed to improve after reading that?\" The star, who is also known for his love of sparkly jumpsuits and doing athletic on-stage backflips, added: \"At least say something valid like 'he low key just flips everywhere can he doing anything else?' \"Or even 'I just don't like his songs even though I'm basing my opinion off the only one that I've heard over and over' (super valid).\" Boone captioned the video containing his message: \"I'm literally giving you ideas.\" Boone showed off his athleticism on stage with Brian May at Coachella Boone's breakout hit has been near-inescapable on radio and social media, and the impassioned folk-pop anthem is still in both the US and UK top 10s more than a year after its release. It was the most popular single of 2024 across digital platforms, with more than two billion streams, according to global music trade body the IFPI, beating hits by Sabrina Carpenter, Teddy Swims and Billie Eilish. Boone was nominated for a Grammy and two Brit Awards, and made headlines at the first weekend of the recent Coachella festival when he brought out Queen guitarist Brian May to perform Bohemian Rhapsody, external. But with such ubiquity comes criticism.  Pitchfork's savage review, external of his first Coachella set pulled no punches and summed up the sentiment of those who can't stand him. \"Benson Boone is horrible, just godawful, the kind of act that makes you wonder if this whole medium has been worth it,\" the site's critic Paul A Thompson wrote. \"His main stage set, at 7pm on Friday - a preposterous slot for him - was nine absolutely insipid originals that seem designed to soundtrack tearful front-facing confession videos followed by a galling (and inexplicably Brian May-assisted) cover of Bohemian Rhapsody. \"I didn't love it.\" Nora Princiotti, co-host of the We're Obsessed podcast, then waded in, external. \"I'm also a Benson Boone hater,\" she said. \"So... reading these [Pitchfork] paragraphs and seeing them tweeted out cleared my skin and corrected my posture, because I don't care that that man can do a flip, I hate that song that's all over TikTok, Beautiful Things.  \"I hated having to talk about it in conjunction with the Grammys. It didn't deserve anything and I never want to think about him again.\" But Boone isn't going away - he is playing a string of other North American festivals this summer, and is releasing his second album, American Heart, in June.

        "title": "Ex-paddleboard firm owner jailed over deaths of four people",
        "content": "This video can not be played Bodycam footage captures Nerys Bethan Lloyd at the scene A former paddleboard firm owner has been jailed for 10 years and six months after the deaths of four people on a river in south-west Wales. Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers and Nicola Wheatley died after paddleboarding in \"extremely hazardous conditions\" on the Western Cleddau river in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire in October 2021. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, 39, an ex-police officer from Port Talbot, pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter last month.  She was sentenced during a two-day hearing at Swansea Crown Court, which heard she was unqualified to lead a paddleboard tour of this kind.   As it happened: Paddleboard firm owner jailed over river deaths Paddleboarder was guided to her death, court told Four paddleboarder deaths were avoidable - report Neither Lloyd nor co-instructor Mr O'Dwyer were qualified to lead the tour, and Mrs Justice Stacey criticised the \"abysmal\" approach to health and safety during her sentencing remarks. Citing her police and RNLI training, the judge said Lloyd \"knew better\", although acknowledged she was \"horrified\" at what happened.  The group of seven participants, led by Lloyd and Mr O'Dwyer, set off after 09:00 BST on 30 October 2021. Three particpants died along with Mr O'Dwyer.  Lloyd was jailed for 10 years and six months During the sentencing hearing, the court heard there had been heavy rain in the days before and \"the river was in flood conditions\" with a \"visibly strong current\". On Tuesday, the court was shown photos of a weir the group was trying to navigate. This included a section called fish pass, which was 11m (36ft) long and on an incline of about one in seven, or 14%.  The court was shown conditions on the weir on the day of the incident, with Mark Watson KC, prosecuting, explaining on Tuesday it showed \"immense turbulence\" of the water.  Nicola Wheatley, Morgan Rogers, Paul O'Dwyer and Andrea Powell died after paddleboarding in 2021 Mrs Justice Mary Stacey said the group \"fell down the face of the weir\" in no more than 20 seconds. They were sucked into a hydraulic jump - or spin - a recirculating flow similar to a washing machine. She added: \"The ankle leashes attached to the boards of those stuck in the hydraulic spin, which are totally unsuitable for fast-flowing water, made it even harder for them to get free.\" Mrs Justice Stacey said that the \"four participants were not wearing wetsuits and one had decided that a life jacket would not be necessary.\" She added there had been \"no safety briefing\" beforehand, none of the participants had the right type of leash for their boards in these conditions and Lloyd did not have any next of kin details. Mr O'Dwyer initially exited the river safely, but then re-entered the water in an attempt to rescue the others. Mr O'Dwyer, from Port Talbot, Ms Rogers, from Merthyr Tydfil, and Ms Wheatley, of Pontarddulais, Swansea county, all died at the scene. Ms Powell, from Bridgend, died in hospital on 5 November 2021, about a week after the incident.  This video can not be played Paddleboard company owner sentenced to 10-and-a-half years in prison The judge said it was clear to her Lloyd intended for the group to go over the weir down the fish pass if possible \"which would be more interesting\" than carrying the boards round the weir. Mr O'Dwyer had researched alternative routes, but all were \"dismissively rejected by you\", the judge said. Mr O'Dwyer deferred to Lloyd as the company owner to decide the final route but raised valid concerns, such as the drop over the weir.  Mrs Justice Stacey said Lloyd's interest \"seemed to be more in an exciting route than safety\" and it was clear from CCTV she went straight down the middle of the weir rather than making any attempt to get to the side.  She added she showed \"a blatant disregard for a very high risk of death\".  Her lawyer told the court Lloyd took \"full blame for the mistakes\" that led to the deaths. He said there was a plan to get out of the water ahead of the weir but the force of the water meant she and the others were carried over it.  The paddleboarders got into difficulties at a weir outside County Hall in Haverfordwest Mrs Justice Stacey asked Mr Elias to explain why Lloyd's arms could be seen in a \"joyful, confident, triumphant\" manner in the video of her going over the weir. The judge said this gave the impression it was \"all intentional,\" adding the gesture seemed to convey \"excitement and fun\". David Elias KC, defending, responded saying this was not the case and Lloyd \"simply couldn't wait for those who were coming behind her because of the force over the weir\". Mrs Justice Stacey said in her sentencing remarks said that Mr O'Dwyer and Lloyd did not intend to harm any participants.  \"But you chose to lead the group over a weir in conditions that could not have been more treacherous, placing all of them in extreme danger,\" the judge added.  Lloyd trained as a firearms officer after joining South Wales Police following university and Mrs Justice Stacey said she would have been \"well-versed\" in the importance of health and safety and risk assessments. Lloyd was sacked by the police in November 2021 for a matter \"unrelated to the paddleboarding incident,\" the force said. A month earlier she accepted a caution for fraud, relating to a vehicle insurance claim. The judge paid tribute to the families of those who died for their \"dignity and courage in the midst of overwhelming grief\". Det Supt Cameron Ritchie, of Dyfed-Powys Police, described the paddleboarding tragedy as \"completely avoidable\".  CCTV footage shows Lloyd with her arms outstretched and standing on the paddleboard Speaking after the sentencing, Lisa Rose, specialist prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service special crime division, said Lloyd was not qualified to take inexperienced paddleboarders out in such conditions. \"There are no words that can articulate the devastation this tragedy has caused, and I can only hope that this sentence provides a sense of justice for those affected,\" she said.  Helen Turner, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector said the victims placed their trust in Lloyd to deliver a safe and enjoyable paddle, \"but through her incompetence, carelessness and complacency she failed to plan or assess the obvious risk at the weir or to take even basic safety measures\". On Tuesday, the court heard powerful impact statements from the families of each of the victims.  Morgan Rogers' mum, Theresa Hall said Lloyd \"guided Morgan to her death\" and the \"physical and mental pain that I now live with is too much to bear\". Speaking to Lloyd, she said, \"you, in your arrogance have stopped me being able to fully grieve for my daughter\". Nicola Wheatley's husband Darren Wheatley called Lloyd \"a coward\" who had \"hidden behind your carefully orchestrated smoke screen\". With audible anger in his voice he said while they \"cried all day\" that Christmas, Lloyd was posting pictures on social media celebrating Christmas lights with her family and friends. This video can not be played Families of the paddleboard tour victims have shared tributes to their loved ones after the woman responsible for their deaths was jailed Mark Powell, the husband of Andrea Powell, said when he saw his wife in a coma he \"burst into tears\" seeing the cuts and bruises to her face and body.  Mr Powell said their son Finn \"had the most amazing bond\" with his mum. When he told Finn, who was seven at the time of her death, that she had died, he burst into \"uncontrollable tears\" and that noise would stay with him forever. Ceri O'Dwyer, the wife of Mr O'Dwyer, had a statement read on her behalf. She told Lloyd she was once her friend but was met with \"blame, rejection and gaslighting\" when she tried to \"shift blame\" on to her husband. Paul made a \"devastating mistake\" but \"died trying to save others\". \"Grief is in our household every single day. You carried on as if nothing ever happened,\" she added.

        "title": "EU hits Apple and Meta with €700m of fines",
        "content": "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined â¬700m (Â£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech. It has issued a â¬500m (Â£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined â¬200m (Â£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection. \"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement. The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\" The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump. The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America. EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\" The White House has been contacted for comment. The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The case against Apple was over its App Store. The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this. Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection. Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.  The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used. In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\" The Commission is currently assessing the new option. In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\". Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines. \"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.  \"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"  Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\" It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings. Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement. The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's â¬2.4bn fine from last September. But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation. In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum, external complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.  \"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC. Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power. They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added. One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.  They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices. Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X., external He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform. A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\" \"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said. The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.  \"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.

        "title": "Istanbul earthquake live: Buildings shaken in Turkey's largest city",
        "content": "Several earthquakes have hit Turkey's largest city Istanbul - the strongest with a magnitude of 6.2 The tremors - also felt in the Turkish capital 275 miles away - sparked panic as people fled shaking buildings More than fifty aftershocks have been recorded but no significant damage has been reported so far No deaths have been reported but at least 151 people are injured after jumping from heights in fear, officials say The BBC's Orla Guerin says the quake was one of the strongest to hit the city in recent years Scientists have long said a big earthquake could hit the city at any time, so moments like this always strike fear into residents, our reporter Asya Robins says This video can not be played Panic and confusion moments after Istanbul earthquake Edited by Emily McGarvey and Alex Smith, with Orla Guerin reporting from Istanbul As we've been reporting, a series of earthquakes have struck near Istanbul, shaking buildings in Turkey's largest city and prompting people to flee apartment blocks. At 12:49 local time (10:49 BST), a 6.2 magnitude quake in the Sea of Marmara triggered panic in Turkey's largest city. Tremors were felt in neighbouring provinces and in the city of Izmir, some 550km (340 miles) south of Istanbul. There have been scores of aftershocks too. So far, there are no reports of major damage, but one abandoned building in the central Fatih district has collapsed. Officials say at least 151 people are being treated in hospital after jumping from high places due to the panic caused. We're now pausing our live coverage, here's our news story which contains everything you need to know. Fatima ÃelikBBC Turkish, reporting from Istanbul Although the earthquakes hit Istanbul on a weekday afternoon, Wednesday is a\nnational holiday here, so schools, universities and public institutions were closed. This meant that more people than usual were at home when the quake struck. Worried about aftershocks and whether buildings were safe, hundreds of\nresidents have decided to spend the night outdoors. In BeÅiktaÅ, one of the city's\nbusiest neighbourhoods, people have gathered in open spaces like the main\nsquare. Selim UstaoÄlu, a university student, was in his dorm room when the\ntremors began. \"At first I thought I was going to faint,\" he says. \"Then\nI realized it was an earthquake. I yelled to alert others and ran\noutside.\" He packed a small bag with essentials like a charger, toothbrush\nand his favourite sweater before heading to the square. \"I'm staying here\ntonight,\" he says. \"I was in the supermarket with my family when everything started to\nshake,\" says Zeynep AkÄ±ncÄ±oÄlu, another student. \"We rushed outside.\nI don't feel safe going back inside, our building doesn't look strong.\" Zeynep AkÄ±ncÄ±oÄlu says she doesn't feel safe going back inside Omar Syed, who is originally from India and has lived in Istanbul for 10 years, says it was the strongest quake he has ever experienced. \"My wife and I were having brunch when it started. We left our building immediately,\" he says. \"You never really feel prepared for something like this.\" Omar Syed and his wife were having brunch when the first quake hit Istanbul A woman holidaying in Istanbul with her family tells the BBC that the building she was staying in \"started to shake quite violently for what seemed like about five minutes\", around Wednesday lunchtime. Caroline and David Warburton, from Rugby in the UK, are visiting with their two children.  The family - who have been staying on the eighth floor of an apartment block - soon realised it was an earthquake, so gathered their passports and phones and rushed out of the building. Caroline says children were crying as residents ran down the stairs. They fled to a local park, along with many others, to try and get away from high-rise buildings. âThe children\nsay they could see cracks in the building, and there is a\nlot of traffic, sirens and fire engines,â Caroline says.  Istanbul Mayor Ekrem ImamoÄlu, who was arrested last month and placed in a high-security jail, says his \"greatest sadness\" is that he can't be with the city's residents today. ImamoÄlu - a key rival  to President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan - is being held on corruption and terrorism charges, which he denies. Turkey's opposition has condemned his arrest as a \"coup attempt against our next president\". In a post on X via his lawyer, ImamoÄlu says: \"As managers and urban planners who have dedicated their lives to disaster-focused planning in Istanbul and who have struggled for this purpose, my greatest sadness is that we can't be with you.\" \"The issue of earthquakes is greater than winning elections,\" he says, adding: \"We urgently need unity, solidarity and common sense.\" Having evacuated their buildings, we're seeing images of people putting up tents in parks in Istanbul's BaÄcÄ±lar district. The city's residents have long feared a major earthquake, and scientists have been warning that one might hit for some time. Duru says people from her neighbourhood are camped out at a public gathering point Duru Yunek\nassumed she was fainting when she started to feel shaky in the middle of her\nmorning shower - but after hearing loud bangs from outside, quickly realised\nher entire home was moving. She says her mobile phone network\ncut out as soon as the earthquake hit, and she couldnât reach her family and\nfriends. âI was really panicked\nbecause I thought it was the major earthquake that weâve all been expecting in\nIstanbul,â she tells the BBC World Service's OS. âThis is a wake up call,â Yunek  says. âI wasnât prepared, my family wasnât prepared. We just froze.â Orla GuerinReporting from Istanbul The pavement cafes in my neighbourhood are full of customers who arenât ready to go back inside yet. Some returned home earlier, only to leave again. When I went back to my flat briefly to collect some broadcasting equipment, there was another tremor as soon as I got through the door. It lasted only a few seconds, and was much milder than the major earthquake earlier - one of the strongest to hit the city in recent years, according to Turkey's disaster agency. There are no reports of deaths or serious injuries. On the streets you can hear the buzz of phones â many people are still getting calls from loved ones to check they are OK. But shops and restaurants remain open, and the city is returning to its normal noisy rhythm. There is a sense here that the city has had a lucky escape, because the earthquakes were offshore in the Sea of Marmara. But everyone knows that more quakes may come. Some here keep an âearthquake bagâ ready, by the front door, with essentials, in case they have to run from their homes. One neighbour told me she was heading home, to pack one.  Schools in Istanbul will be closed on Thursday and Friday, Education Minister Yusuf Tekin has announced. He adds that no serious incidents have been reported at any schools in the city, and that school gardens will be open to members of the public to be used as safe spaces. A total of 51 aftershocks have been recorded following the powerful 6.2 magnitude earthquake which hit Istanbul earlier, according to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya. The strongest of those was 5.9 magnitude, he says. Yerlikaya adds that the 6.2 magnitude earthquake was recorded approximately seven kilometres underground and lasted 13 seconds. Turkey's emergency call centre has so far received over 6,000 calls, he says, with most people contacting the line for information. Earlier we reported that the Istanbul governor's office said 151 people had been injured after jumping from height in panic after the earthquake. Fatima ÃelikBBC Turkish, reporting from Istanbul When the earthquakes hit Istanbulâs\ncentral district of BeÅiktaÅ, loud screams came from the houses. People didnât\nknow what to do and ran outside in panic. Now, you can see many of them waiting\non the streets in their pyjamas, holding bags and pets. Everyone is on their\nphone, trying to reach their loved ones. The traffic is jammed. Fear is written on\nevery face. At least 151 people have been injured after jumping from high places due to panic caused by the earthquakes, Istanbul's governor's office says. In a post on X, it adds there have been no recorded fatalities, and no residential buildings have collapsed. An abandoned building in Istanbul's Fatih district collapsed, it says, but no deaths or injuries have been recorded as a result. Energy and gas supplies, drinking water and sewage infrastructure are also unaffected, it adds. While we wait for more details, let's look back at the powerful earthquakes that struck southern Turkey and Syria in early 2023. In February 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit south-eastern Turkey, close to the Syrian border, killing tens of thousands and injuring many more. The quake struck near the city of Gaziantep and was quickly followed by several aftershocks, including one almost as big as the first. It was so destructive because it broke along around100km (62 miles) of fault line, causing major damage to buildings nearby. We're now hearing from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is speaking about the quakes at a children's festival in Ankara, the country's capital. He says search efforts are ongoing and he's following the situation closely, adding that ministers earlier told him that there were \"no problems\" so far.  Weâve now got more images showing what the streets look like after the earthquake hit. From what we can see, thereâs a large crowd on the street. Some people are sitting on the ground, while others are making phone calls. Burak AbatayBBC Turkish, reporting from Istanbul I was in Pendik, one of the large districts on the Asian side of Istanbul, when the earthquake hit. The 6.2 magnitude quake was the most terrifying experience my father â who has limited mobility â and I have had in a long time. Everyone in our building rushed outside. While we were still trying to process what had happened, we felt another tremor. People panicked â grabbing their pets, holding their children, helping the elderly. Istanbul is huge, and people Iâve spoken to say there are too few safe open spaces to shelter in during a disaster. One person asked: âWhat will we do if thereâs an even bigger earthquake? Where will we go?â Another, worried about the condition of her very old apartment, said: âI probably shouldnât go back in tonight. But what am I supposed to do?â We're now seeing pictures of a partially collapsed abandoned building in Istanbul's Fatih district after a series of earthquakes. Itâs not yet known if there are any casualties. Authorities are urging people not to go near buildings that could be damaged. Today's earthquakes struck during a live TV interview on CNN Turk, with presenter Meltem BozbeyoÄlu staying on air as the studio shook.

Paul KirbyEurope digital editor Istanbul sits on the North Anatolian fault line so it is vulnerable to earthquakes. The city has seen deadly tremors before and its residents have long feared an even bigger one. The Kandilli observatory has put the risk of Istanbul experiencing a 7-magnitude quake by 2030 at 64%. In 1999, a 7.4-magnitude quake claimed 17,000 lives and last year Turkey's environment minister warned that Istanbul did not have the capacity to withstand another one. \"One in every five houses in Istanbul, almost 1.5 million, are considered structurally unstable,\" said Murat Kurum. The environment minister recently spoke of fighting earthquakes as a matter of national security. The devastating twin quakes in south-eastern Turkey and Syria in February 2023 were of 7.6 and 7.7 in magnitude and left 55,000 people dead. Turkish geologist and earthquake expert Naci GÃ¶rÃ¼r says todayâs earthquakes happened on the Kumburgaz fault. The Kumburgaz and Adalar faults are the closest to Istanbul, and both are key to the larger earthquake that has long been expected in the city. GÃ¶rÃ¼r says in a post on X that todayâs earthquakes are \"not the big earthquakes we expect\", which he thinks will be above magnitude seven, but they do add to the stress on the Kumburgaz fault and make it more likely to break. He calls on the government, Istanbul municipality and the public to work together to prepare the city for earthquakes. The map below shows the first three earthquakes that struck Istanbul's Silivri and Buyukcekmece districts earlier today. They happened in the Sea of Marmara, to the west of the city.

        "title": "Driving test backlog to be cleared by next summer, UK pledges",
        "content": "The transport secretary has pledged to reduce the number of learner drivers in England waiting more than five months to sit practical tests. Heidi Alexander said the government would aim to clear the backlog by next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue. Current driving test wait times are \"totally unacceptable\", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday. There is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK, according to data from the AA. The transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an \"increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour\" for the backlog. In order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available. She said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily \"return to the frontline\". She said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests. A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added. Six-month driving test waits in some areas, AA says Driving test backlog sees exams sold for over Â£200 Three quarters of driving test centres hit maximum wait time  She said there were plans to crackdown on test booking bots which she said were \"exploiting learners\". Test booking bots are automated software which can act much faster than a human to rapidly book an appointment on the DVSA website. Such bots can secure multiple test slots and some companies have used this technology to resell driving test slots at inflated prices. Learner driver Millie Moyler is due to sit her test this summer - almost 18 months since she started looking for a slot in December 2023. \"It's had a massive impact on my life,\" the university student from High Wycombe told BBC Radio 5 Live. Millie said she had been held back by the delay and was \"hopeful\" she would pass her long-awaited first try in July. The wait for a test used to be a mere 10 weeks, according to driving instructor Sue Howe. \"But since Covid, it's just so difficult to get a test,\" she told the BBC on Wednesday. The instructor from Swindon said a shortage of examiners was to blame: \"If they're short of examiners, they just can't produce the tests.\" Emma Bush, managing director of AA Driving School, welcomed the \"further details of how the DVSA will meet its target waiting time of seven weeks by the end of the year\". \"Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,\" she said. \"Many people, particularly young people, need to pass their driving test for their job or to access education. Unblocking the system by creating extra tests will help ensure people are not being held back due to a lack of a driving licence.\" Have you been waiting a long time for a driving test?

        "title": "The battle to ban greyhound racing in Scotland",
        "content": "Narisa Rojanamonthien, who adopted rescue dog Crafty, is backing a proposed ban on greyhound racing  Once a sport that packed out stadiums across the country, greyhound racing is facing extinction in Scotland.  As the nation's last track shuts its door indefinitely, MSPs are considering a bill that would ban the sport for good.  Campaigners are demanding Scotland follow Wales in committing to outlaw what they describe as outright animal cruelty.  Trainers and owners insist their sport is a misunderstood hobby that prioritises the welfare of dogs.  In recent years just one greyhound track in Scotland, Thornton Stadium in Kirkcaldy, has been staging races. It closed until further notice in March, citing difficulties with finding a betting partner and concerns about the proposed ban.  The sport may appear to be dying out. Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell is determined to keep it that way.  He has lodged a members bill in parliament proposing a ban, though he is seemingly facing an uphill battle to win government support.  According to the latest data, external from the Greyhound Board of Great Britain (GBGB), the sport's regulator, 109 greyhounds died trackside in the UK in 2023. A further 4,238 injuries were recorded.  \"These dogs deserve so much better,\" says Narisa Rojanamonthien, who adopted rescue dog Crafty in 2023. \"They deserve a loving home.\" Lorraine Baker runs an organisation which finds homes for former racing greyhounds  Like many greyhounds raised in racing kennels, Crafty has numbers tattooed on his inner ears, and has struggled to socialise with other dogs and humans. Lorraine Baker, who runs the Scottish Greyhound Sanctuary, says racing dogs are at risk of shattered legs and broken necks. One dog her organisation took in even had a parasitic brain worm.  \"The sooner the ban happens the better,\" she tells BBC Scotland News.  Animal welfare charities have also raised concerns about owners euthanising dogs that are deemed unfit to race, whether due to age, injury or simply being deemed surplus to requirements.  There were once more than 20 tracks in Scotland. But the sport has been in decline across the UK since the middle of the 20th century.  Back then it used to attract punters by their thousands and generated huge revenues as a key part of Britain's gambling industry.  In recent decades tracks were marketed to stag and hen parties, or as a fun office night out.  There are fewer than 30 greyhound racers left in the country. Currently without a track, their sport's looming extinction could render moral arguments about a ban redundant.  Gill Docherty, founder and trustee of campaign group Scotland Against Greyhound Exploitation, has spent years protesting outside Thornton and other tracks.  Her petition calling for the sport to be banned, external is the most signed in Scottish parliamentary history.  She tells BBC Scotland News: \"If there's not a legislative change yes Thornton might eventually die off, but we don't want to leave that door ajar for a resurgence if there became more interest in it in decades to come.\" Scotland Against Greyhound Exploitation campaigners are backing a ban proposed by Green MSP Mark Rusekll, centre James Shand, an owner and trainer from Cowdenbeath, has been racing greyhounds at Thornton for 40 years. With the track \"highly unlikely\" to re-open, he has just given up his last three dogs.  He tells BBC Scotland News family circumstances mean he is unable to keep the greyhounds as pets. \"My dogs were better fed than some of the bairns running in the streets,\" Mr Shand says. \"That's what really annoys me about the people trying to ban greyhound racing.\" He says he has never put down a dog because it could no longer race, and insists he does not know a trainer who would do so.  As his lifelong passion seemingly dies out in Scotland, Mr Shand is mournful over the dwindling community of trainers.  \"We never even got a last meeting,\" he says. \"So there are boys you'll never ever see again.\"  James Shand, right, has been racing dogs at Thornton for 40 years  If passed, Ruskell's Prohibition of Greyhound Racing (Scotland) Bill would create an offence of permitting a greyhound to compete at racetracks in Scotland, with a maximum sentence of up to five years. The Green MSP tells BBC Scotland News: \"From the dogs' point of view, it doesn't matter whether they're at Thornton or elsewhere in the UK. \"They're still facing that inherent risk of being raced at speeds of up to 40mph. And that's where they can break their legs, that's where they can break their necks.\" He adds: \"And these are just gentle creatures. We shouldn't be putting them under this kind of risk of racing. It's unacceptable.\" Paul Brignal has owned Thornton Stadium since 2002. He tells BBC Scotland he has hopes of racing dogs there again but will hold off on any decision until he sees the outcome of Ruskell's \"outrageous\" and \"seriously flawed\" bill. As it is not licenced by the GBGB, Thornton has not been compelled to keep a record of injuries and adhere to safety standards.  Mr Brignal says he would be willing to comply with recommendations from a 2023 report by the Scottish Animal Welfare Commission, external if it means the track can stay open. That report called for the Thornton to record injuries and have a vet present at race meets. He says Thornton has kept track of serious injuries since 2022 - recording six in that time, including one dog who was put down after suffering a broken leg. Greyhound racing has declined in popularity since the middle of the 20th century  Mr Brignal says: \"I assure you it is safer for a greyhound to run around a prepared track than it is running around a park or golf course, where a rabbit hole or tree stump can cause a far more horrendous injury.\" But with his track closed for the foreseeable future and the pool of racing regulars shrinking, he says there is \"very little possibility\" of another track opening soon.  \"It would need a large investment for very little return,\" Mr Brignal says. \"So when and if Thornton Stadium closes, then I would assume that greyhound racing in Scotland will end.\" Ruskell's has been backed by MSPs from all parties. The Scottish government, however, has said it is not \"convinced\" a ban is required. Ministers have said they would consider a licensing scheme instead, with owners and trainers penalised if they breach animal welfare standards.  A spokesperson said: \"The Scottish Government takes the welfare of animals very seriously.  \"We will fully consider the detail and implications of Mark Ruskell's bill to prohibit greyhound racing in Scotland once a draft of the Bill is available.\" The Greyhound Board of Great Britain said the bill had \"no relevance\" to Scotland as no licensed racing was currently taking place. Chief executive Mark Bird said: \"This is a confused and ill thought-out piece of legislation with implications that go well beyond the remit of racing greyhounds in Scotland.\" He added: \"This Bill ignores the substantial evidence which proves the need for effective regulation to safeguard greyhound welfare.\" The UK government has \"no plans\" to introduce a ban in England. The sport may be on its last legs in Scotland, but those who wish to see it permanently banned are not nearly ready to give up the chase.

        "title": "US President Donald Trump says he has 'no intention of firing' Fed boss Jerome Powell",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: 'It will be expensive' - Americans react to the impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda. Trump said he has \"no intention of firing\" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be \"a little more active\" on cutting interest rates. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.  He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".  The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans. Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war. In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.  This video can not be played Watch: Trump says US is actively negotiating a 'fair' tariffs deal with China Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was \"not a joke\". The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.  The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised. Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him \"a major loser\". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.  National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden. It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so. Why should I care if the US dollar falls? US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%. That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.  US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading. Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation. Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the forecast for US economic growth for this year was given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs. The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicted. Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\". The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration. However, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.

        "title": "Government borrowing for financial year higher than expected",
        "content": "The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs being felt on the UK economy. Borrowing, the difference between spending and income from taxes, was Â£151.9bn in the year to March, up Â£20.7bn from the year before. The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports. The higher levels of borrowing has added to growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules. In response to the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the chancellor's rules on borrowing were \"non-negotiable\", adding that the government would \"never play fast and loose with the public finances\". Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the borrowing overshoot \"even before the influence from the tariff chaos is felt\" raised the chances of \"more tax hikes\". \"Reeves may not be too far away from having to raise money again in the Autumn Budget, by cutting spending and/or raising taxes, to meet her fiscal rules,\" she added. One of Reeves's main rules for the UK economy is not to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending. But sluggish economic growth and higher interest rates on government borrowing in recent months have led to warnings that it will be difficult for the chancellor to stick to them without raising taxes. Global growth forecast slashed by IMF over tariff impact Three more UK interest rate cuts this year, predicts IMF The UK is one of many countries to be hit with tariffs on goods entering the US, with President Donald Trump looking to upend the long-established order of global trade in a bid to boost American manufacturing and jobs. But Reeves is aiming to avoid the import taxes hitting UK exporters by agreeing a trade deal with the US. US Vice-President JD Vance has said there was a \"good chance\" of a trade deal. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund, an influential global organisation, forecast that UK growth would be lower than previously expected for 2025 at 1.1%, down from 1.6%. Governments like to see economic growth as it leads to more jobs and businesses being created, better living standards on average, and ultimately higher income through taxation.  The UK government has made growth its top priority, but the IMF said it would be stifled in part by tariffs on goods entering the US along with rising inflation and borrowing costs.  The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government borrowed almost Â£15bn more than the Â£137.3bn expected in the year to March due to increased spending on pay and benefits. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said the rise in borrowing was despite the government receiving a \"substantial boost in income\" from taxation. He added at the end of the financial year, debt remained \"close to the annual value of the output of the economy, at levels last seen in the early 1960s\". The debt interest paid by the government increased to by Â£1.3bn to Â£4.3bn last month. James Smith, a markets economist at ING, said the cost of government borrowing created a \"very challenging environment for the government\" \"I think it puts pressure on them to potentially raise taxes again later this year,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. Jones said the government was going \"through every penny of taxpayer money spent, line by line, for the first time in 17 years to tear out waste\". But shadow chancellor Mel Stride called the borrowing figures \"alarming, but not surprising\", adding that they \"lay bare the price the British people are paying for Rachel Reeves' choices\". Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper meanwhile called the figures \"damning\" and called on Reeves to scrap \"her disastrous jobs tax\". How does the government borrow money?

        "content": "Re-enactments of the procession of the Passion took place in Durban, South Africa and across the continent on Good Friday If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa. The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase. While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another. When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making? \"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation. But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\". \"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said. However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\" And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world. He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI. This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center. \"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said. Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation. Pope Francis has been commended for his role as peacemaker in Africa - seen here in 2015 in Bangui But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism. \"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me. \"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate. \"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\" The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\". \"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said. In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican. He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\". \"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\" Pope Francis faced a backlash in parts of Africa over blessings being offered to same-sex couples Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa. For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers. His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war. But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues. Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples. The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\". This video can not be played Watch: Might the next pope come from Africa? It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries. The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue. Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\". Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\" And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\". Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church. And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa. \"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said. \"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\" As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised. It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\". But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable. \"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction. \"I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\" Argentina mourns Pope who left for the Vatican - and never came back What happens now and what does the Pope do?

        "title": "The record-breaking tunnel being built from Denmark to Germany",
        "content": "The completed tunnel will slash travel times between Hamburg and Copenhagen A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe. Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel. It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together. The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark. The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\". \"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel. To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.  Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France â burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks. \"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\" The 18km long rail and road tunnel between Denmark and Germany will comprise five parallel tubes With a price-tag around â¬7.4bn ($8.1bn; Â£6.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with â¬1.3bn from the European Commission. It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying. Once completed, the journey between RÃ¸dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage. Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers. \"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\" Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead. \"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element. There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor. At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\" Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats. Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision. \"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\" The tunnel is being built from north to south, via a construction facility around its northern entrance Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes. With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark. A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration. \"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\" So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\" Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact. One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise. However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead. \"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock. When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day. According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says. It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions. \"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\" Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "content": "Elon Musk (left) with Donald Trump outside the White House (file photo) Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year. Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs. But Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla. His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.  Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month. But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely. Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk \"as long as I could keep him\". This video can not be played Watch: Trump says he would 'love to keep' Musk working in his administration Who is Elon Musk? What is Doge and why is Musk cutting so many jobs? Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk The tech boss said he would now \"be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work \"critical\" and pledging to stay on \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\". On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand. Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\".  Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.  Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\". \"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said. Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\". Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire \"focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences\". \"I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,\" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase. Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.  Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the company said earlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years. The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.  \"Tesla's problems are mounting,\" he said.

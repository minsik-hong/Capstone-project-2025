Her husband, Ramin Dehbandi, expressed deep sorrow and plans to seek justice through civil courts, highlighting the emotional impact on their daughter, who blames him for her mother's absence.

2025-04-25 10:26:29.905494 | Q: 한국말 해봐 | A: Asian economies are experiencing significant market declines due to fears of a global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's new tariffs, which range from 10% to 46% on various countries. Major stock indices across Asia, including the Shanghai Composite, Hang Seng, and Nikkei 225, saw their largest drops in decades, with Hong Kong's market plummeting over 13%. The tariffs are particularly damaging to Asia's manufacturing sectors, heavily reliant on US exports, affecting countries like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Analysts warn that the heightened tariffs could lead to inflation and a potential recession in the US, which would further harm Asian economies. Global markets have lost trillions in value since the tariff announcements, with predictions of continued volatility. | Sources: ['https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c934qzd094wo']

Four people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance and death of a two-year-old boy named Emile Soleil in the French Alps. Among those arrested are Emile's grandparents and their adult children. Prosecutors are investigating the case, which has gained a lot of media attention in France.

Last year, some of Emile's bones and clothes were discovered by a hiker near his grandparents' home. However, investigators could not determine the cause of his death. They mentioned that it could have been due to a fall, manslaughter, or murder. The recent arrests have brought new hope for answers in a case that seemed to have gone cold.

Emile was last seen on July 8, 2023, walking alone in his village. His grandmother reported him missing shortly after. Many people, including police and volunteers, searched for him, but it took time to find his remains. Emile's funeral was held in February 2024, and his family has expressed a strong desire for answers about his death.

2025-05-05 13:59:12.848318 | Q: usa news | A: **Article Summary**

US President Donald Trump has signed an order to reduce the funding and operations of the Voice of America (VOA). He claims that the organization is "anti-Trump" and spreads "radical propaganda." The White House says this decision will protect taxpayers from funding what they consider biased news.

VOA was created during World War II to fight against Nazi propaganda. It currently reaches millions of people around the world each week. Mike Abramowitz, the director of VOA, mentioned that he and most of his staff are now on paid leave, making it hard for VOA to fulfill its important mission, especially with countries like Iran, China, and Russia spreading false information about the US.

The National Press Club, which represents US journalists, criticized Trump’s order. They believe it threatens press freedom and the future of independent journalism at VOA. The order also affects the US Agency for Global Media, which funds other news organizations like Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.

Many employees at VOA and related organizations have been told there is no money to pay them. The Czech Republic's Foreign Minister hopes the European Union can help keep Radio Free Europe operating. Elon Musk, a close adviser to Trump, has called for VOA to be shut down. Trump has also cut funding for other federal agencies, including those that help the homeless and support museums.

Voice of America started in 1942 to combat enemy propaganda. It has a public charter to ensure its independence. Over the years, it has adapted to changing laws and continues to serve a large audience.

  

**Important Words**

- **Dismantling**  
  - Breaking something down or taking it apart.

- **Propaganda**  
  - Information that is spread to promote a particular point of view, often biased or misleading.

- **Adversaries**  
  - Enemies or opponents, especially in a political or military context.

- **Independent**  
  - Not controlled by others; able to make decisions on its own.

Richard McDonald, a former champion runner and trader, is now trading stocks privately. He was surprised by the rapid market changes caused by global tariffs announced by Donald Trump. These tariffs led to a significant drop in stock prices and created uncertainty in the market. Many investors are unsure about the future and are choosing to hold cash instead of stocks. Some tariffs were paused, but high tariffs on imports, especially from China, remain. This situation is causing inflation and economic concerns.

리처드 맥도날드는 이전에 챔피언 러너였고 현재는 개인적으로 주식을 거래하는 사람입니다. 그는 도널드 트럼프가 발표한 글로벌 관세로 인해 시장이 빠르게 변하는 것에 놀랐습니다. 이러한 관세는 주가의 큰 하락을 초래했고 시장에 불확실성을 만들었습니다. 많은 투자자들이 미래에 대해 확신이 없어서 주식 대신 현금을 보유하고 있습니다. 일부 관세는 일시 중지되었지만, 특히 중국에서의 수입품에 대한 높은 관세는 여전히 남아 있습니다. 이 상황은 인플레이션과 경제적 우려를 일으키고 있습니다.

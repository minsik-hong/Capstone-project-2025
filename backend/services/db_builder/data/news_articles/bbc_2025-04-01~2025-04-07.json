        "content": "Jayne Evans is one of hundreds of \"placeholder\" resident doctors who do not know where they will be based Jayne Evans has completed four years at medical school in London - but says she is still being left in the dark about where her first permanent NHS position will be. \"I was told that I don't have a job set aside for me,\" she said. \"They've guaranteed we will only be offered jobs other people decline and there's just no sort of timeline that they can give us.\" Ms Evans has been given a rough idea of where she will be working - the Trent area, which spans almost all of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire - but no further clues. \"They've even admitted it could be three weeks before I start work that I find out what city I'm living in,\" she told the BBC. Ms Evans says working as an epidemiologist during the Covid pandemic inspired her to become a doctor She is one of hundreds of newly qualified medical students who have not been found a specific job by the NHS yet. Instead they have a so-called \"placeholder job\", meaning they have only been told the rough part of the country they will be in. Without knowing where they will be living, they say they are not able to start preparations for moving. It is the second year a new system has been used to allocate foundation jobs for doctors. Previously, students were ranked and jobs were allocated based on merit, but this was changed for fear it was stressful for students and particularly unfair on those from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minorities.  They tended to perform less well, and therefore were more likely to be posted to regions they did not favour, according to the UK Foundation Programme. Instead, jobs are assigned randomly, which means a higher proportion of students are not getting what they asked for. There has also been an increase in the number of medical students applying for jobs after the government opened several new medical schools. Ms Evans said it had overshadowed her achievement in qualifying. \"I was expecting around this time to feel excited or even nervous, but now mostly I just feel angry and disrespected,\" she said. \"I went into medicine and was told we needed doctors and the NHS needs help but I've been told there is no job for me. \"No-one's offered me any sort of clarity or even an apology.\" Dr Hassan Nassar was one of more than 1,000 medical students in the same position last year. The British Medical Association (BMA) estimates that number has dropped to about 700 this year. \"My graduation was one of uncertainty, not excitement,\" recalled the 24-year-old. \"I was assigned to the East Midlands - somewhere in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland - but didn't know which hospital I'd be in for months, so couldn't plan my life or find a place to live. \"I spent the first four weeks of my job as a doctor in temporary accommodation.\" He said he was lucky he ended up allocated to Leicester, even if it was last minute. \"I had no links to the East Midlands and was so nervous about coming,\" he said. \"But Leicester has welcomed me with open arms. It is such a friendly and brilliant city, I'm lucky that I've been able to make friends and make it work.\" Dr Hassan Nassar says not knowing where he was working until the last minute meant he could not plan his life The BMA, the union that represents doctors and medical students in the UK, has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors - formerly known as junior doctors - after increasing the number of medical school places. \"The government has increased the number of medical school places - but not the number of foundation jobs,\" Callum Williams, the union's deputy chair of education, said. \"The government needs to increase that funding - and these jobs should go to UK-trained doctors first.\" Mr Williams said there was a danger students would move abroad. \"It's your first job with the NHS, it is supposed to be exciting and instead it leaves a sour taste in your mouth,\" he said. \"It's essential that we keep doctors in the NHS - and when this is students' first experience with NHS employment, it increases the risk that they'll join so many of their colleagues in moving abroad.\" The BMA worries resident doctors will leave to work abroad if they have poor experiences with the NHS Research carried out by the BMA found almost a third of current medical students say they intend on working abroad, and close to half of those say they do not plan to return. Ms Evans was born in the US but has lived in the UK since she was 12. She said: \"People hear my accent and say, 'are you American? Are you going back to America?' \"I've been really confident the whole time I've been studying saying I don't want to go back to America. I love it here. \"I want to work for the NHS, I really am passionate about healthcare that is free at the point of access. That really matters to me.\" Now she isn't so sure. She said: \"When I told my family this was happening, I was in the US and they sat down with me and said 'what are you doing? Just come back, because you won't be treated like that here'.\" The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment and referred the BBC to NHS England. An NHS England spokesperson said: \"While record numbers of applicants have received their first choice this year, we appreciate the uncertainty and anxiety that many applicants who have been allocated placeholder posts experience while we finalise their training programme. \"We have reassured those affected that they will receive a place on a training programme with support available from their foundation schools during the wait - we will continue to work closely with foundation schools to get applicants more information about their programmes as soon as possible.\" Are you a new doctor who doesn't know what your job will be?

        "title": "UK to relax electric car sale rules as Donald Trump's tariffs hit",
        "content": "The government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US. A ban selling new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, but manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast its changes were not a \"silver bullet\" but part of the solution to responding to US tariffs. UK opposition parties said Labour's measures would not be enough to boost the car industry. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, which is a major export market for the UK motor industry.  It came into force last week and is separate to a 10% tax on nearly all UK products announced by Trump on Wednesday.    A consultation on the government's EV target changes ended in mid-February, but Alexander told the BBC that the government had sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs.  The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously \"strengthen its commitment to the phase out\" while introducing \"practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition\". Currently, 28% of new cars sold in the UK this year must be electric, a target that will rise each year until 2030. But manufacturers will now be given more freedom in how they meet their yearly targets - meaning if they don't sell enough EVs in one year, they can make up for it by selling more the next year, for example. In addition, the fine of Â£15,000 per vehicle sold that does not meet the latest emissions standards will be cut to Â£12,000. Meanwhile, a ban on the sale of hybrid vehicles - which combines a petrol or diesel-powered engine with an electric motor - has been confirmed as from 2035. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline As part of the changes, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Times on Monday that the government is \"putting Â£2.3bn towards tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure\".  The Treasury later told the BBC this means the government will invest Â£2.3bn in the car industry - all of which was announced in last October's Budget. Live updates as Trump's tariff turmoil deepens Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be? 'Sometimes you have to take medicine': Trump defends plan The ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars was extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government, but Labour promised to restore the 2030 deadline in its manifesto for the 2024 election. Car industry leaders have previously warned that drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and a lack of charging point infrastructure. Sir Keir said the measures would \"boost growth that puts money in working people's pockets\" and ensure \"home-grown firms\" can export UK-made cars worldwide. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the changes are \"very much needed\". However, Robert Forrester, chief executive of car dealership chain Vertu Motors, told the BBC said there were \"lots and lots of words in the announcement but it doesn't really address the major issues\". He said manufacturers will still be paying billions in fines, despite the cut to Â£12,000 per car. \"Nothing has really changed here - this is just tinkering,\" he said, adding: \"The government has gone for hope over reality.\" Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith described the measures as \"half baked\" and repeated Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's claim that \"net zero by 2050 is impossible\". Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson called for \"better incentives\" for consumers to buy electric vehicles, and said the changes \"won't be enough to protect the sector from the impact of Trump's damaging tariffs\". The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union. Coventry-based car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover announced on Saturday that it will \"pause\" all shipments in April to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\". A separate 10% tariff on UK imports came into effect on Saturday, with higher rates in place for some other major economies.

        "content": "Critics says Zimbabwe's president is trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced he will suspend tariffs on goods imported from the US in an attempt to build a \"positive relationship\" with President Donald Trump's administration. The move comes days after Trump imposed 18% tariffs on Zimbabwean exports to the US. \"This measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States,\" Mnangagwa said on X.  Zimbabwe has had strained diplomatic relations with the US since it adopted a controversial land policy about 25 years ago, and because of its poor human rights record.  Trade between the two countries amounted to only $111.6m (Â£86.6m) in 2024, US government data shows, external.  Follow live: Global leaders try to soften tariffs impact   The US exported goods worth $43.8m to Zimbabwe in 2024, up 10.6% from the previous year, while imports were down 41% to  $67.8m. Zimbabwean political analyst Tendai Mbanje told AFP news agency that the decision would not result in substantial economic benefits for Zimbabwe and would would only benefit the US.  Prominent Zimbabwean journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin'ono said  the president appeared to be trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration.  Mnangawa possibly hoped that the administration would lift sanctions imposed on him, but it was a \"long shot\", he added on X.     Trump's tariffs could be death knell for  US-Africa trade pact How jeans and diamonds pushed Lesotho to the top of Trump's tariffs list Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy The US first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's government during the rule of Robert Mugabe after he introduced a land reform programme in 2000 that led to the seizure of white-owned farms, and because of repressive measures taken against the opposition. The Biden administration in the US scrapped the sanctions in 2024, replacing them with targeted sanctions on 11 individuals - including Mnangagwa - for \"democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption\".  Mnangagwa has previously denied the allegations, describing the sanctions as \"illegal and unjustified\".  Announcing his decision to waive tariffs on US imports, he said Zimbabwe's focus was on \"fostering amicable relations with all nations, and cultivating adversarial relationships with none\". \"This action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation,\" he added.  Chin'ono said that Mnangagwa was currently the chairman of the regional bloc Sadc, and should be trying to forge a common response to the US rather than acting unilaterally.  \"When countries face global economic shifts, co-ordinated responses offer better leverage and stability,\" he added.  Lesotho - another southern African state - was hit with 50% tariffs, the highest in the list released by Trump on Wednesday. Its government said it would send a delegation to the US to negotiate a new deal, and it would look for new markets for its goods.  How might tariffs change the price of Nike's iconic trainers?

        "title": "US cancels visas for South Sudanese over deportation dispute",
        "content": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the US is immediately revoking visas issued to all South Sudanese passport holders due to the African nation refusing to accept its citizens who have been removed from the US.  Rubio, in a statement on Saturday, added that the US would also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry. He blamed \"the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner\". A cornerstone of President Donald Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants from the US, with the promise of \"mass deportations\". \"It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States,\" said Rubio.  \"Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them,\" he added. It comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war. On 8 March, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as regional fighting broke out, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018. South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to remain in the US for a set period of time.  TPS for South Sudanese in the US had been due to expire by 3 May. South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. But just two years later, following a rift between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar, the tensions erupted into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army. Sporadic violence between ethnic and local groups has continued in parts of the country. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has clashed with international governments over deportations of their nationals from the US.   In January, Colombian President Gustavo Petro barred two US military flights carrying deported migrants from landing in his South American country.  Petro relented after Trump promised to place crippling tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. One of the most famous South Sudanese citizens currently in the US is Duke University star basketball player 18-year-old Khaman Maluach. A spokesman for the university said on Sunday the school was \"aware of the announcement... regarding visa holders from South Sudan\". \"We are looking into the situation and working expeditiously to understand any implications for Duke students.\" Maluach, who played for the South Sudanese Olympic basketball team last summer, spent much of his life in Uganda after fleeing his violence in his homeland as a child. The first-year student - whose Duke team was eliminated from the national championship tournament Saturday night after losing in the semi-finals to the University of Houston - is widely expected to join the ranks of the NBA after graduation.

Lee Baker, 48, and his 10-year-old daughter Esme Baker, died at Golden Beach Holiday Park, in Ingoldmells, Skegness on Saturday. They were from the Nottingham area and had been \"excited to be spending the first weekend of the holidays together\", their family said in a tribute. \"We are all utterly devastated at what's happened. This loss is incomprehensible at the moment,\" they added. Drone footage of the park showed the remains of the caravan after the fire on Saturday Lincolnshire Police said it was still awaiting formal identification, which could take some time.   The police and fire service were called to the holiday park at about 03:50 BST on Saturday and said they were working together on the investigation to establish the cause of the blaze.  Senior investigating officer Det Insp Lee Nixon said the intensity of the fire had made the investigation \"incredibly challenging\". \"We are working hard to validate the facts available to us to be able to provide answers for the family and loved ones of those who were very tragically taken by this fire,\" he said.  Dan Moss, area manager for prevention and protection at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said: \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the family at this time.  \"Once investigations are complete, local fire crews and our community fire safety team will be on hand to talk to people in the area and address any fire safety concerns they may have, at what will be an upsetting time.\" Tributes were left at the Golden Beach Holiday Park on Sunday morning In a statement, the owners of the park said: \"On behalf of everyone at Golden Beach Holiday Park we would like to send our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends affected by [Saturday's] tragic events.\" They thanked emergency services for their help and support and asked for \"patience and privacy\" while investigations continued. People laid tributes at the park on Sunday morning. Jack Price, who works as a bingo caller at the Sandancer pub in Ingoldmells, said he knew Mr Baker and Esme well.  \"It's like they were family members, they weren't just customers to us. Everyone behind the bar knew them. It's just unbelievable,\" he said. An online fundraiser set up by the pub for the victims' family described them as \"two peas in a pod\" who were \"both happy-go-lucky people who loved life\". Ruth Dorrin, who donated to the appeal, said: \"It's just so sad and when you've got little ones, it's just heartbreaking. \"You're meant to come on holiday to enjoy yourself, aren't you? It's justâ¦ you can't put into words.\" Another fundraising page set up to support the family said: \"Lee was a hard working plasterer who loved his football and adored his darling daughter. \"Esme was the brightest, funniest, most intelligent, happy little girl who loved to read, colour, dance her little heart out.\"  Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

Alterations have been made to the ScotRail timetable and passengers have been urged to check their journeys before travelling. Network Rail said the damage was significant Police Scotland said the driver had left the scene of the crash before officers arrived at about 19:40. A spokesperson for the force said inquiries were ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

        "title": "DIY: Are Britons losing their ability to do it themselves?",
        "content": "Handyman Simon King says people are losing the ability to carry out even the most basic of tasks Are Britons losing their ability to mend, preferring instead to call in a professional at the first sight of a blown fuse? BBC News takes a dive into the issue. Handyman Simon King makes an interesting point, as he holds his well-thumbed copy of Collins Complete DIY Manual, acquired when he bought his first house 30 years ago: \"You don't see comedies on the TV poking fun at DIY mishaps these days, do you?\" If sitcoms loosely mirror life, it is perhaps no wonder that the likes of hapless DIYer Frank Spencer, played by Michael Crawford, no longer draw in prime time audiences. After all, there is not much comedy gold in a professional fixing a kitchen tap without causing a biblical flood, or putting up a shelf - and it staying attached to the wall. \"People just aren't doing as much DIY,\" reports Mr King, offering a view from the coalface. Michael Crawford's character Frank Spencer entertained viewers with his tales of DIY woe Matt Walton, senior analyst at Globaldata, a company that provides insights on various industries, including retail, agrees. He believes the boom period of DIY, seen during the Covid pandemic, has \"been and gone\". \"When people were furloughed they had time on their hands to do jobs around the house,\" he says. \"But we've moved on.\" Mr Walton cites difficulties in getting on the housing ladder as another reason for the DIY malaise. He says: \"We have a lot of people in Britain in rental accommodation. In many cases, they are not permitted to carry out work on properties themselves. \"I also think these skills are just not being passed down to younger generations, as they once were.\" Fewer people are attempting DIY jobs around the house, it is claimed Mr King, 55, who operates out of Lincoln, thinks Britain has lost its \"make do and mend\" culture.  \"My dad was from that era... and I think most people from his generation would at least have had a go at stuff, which is where a lot of the comedy stuff came from when it went wrong.\"  Mr King recalls taking TVs apart \"just to see how they worked\", before screwing them back together.  \"These days, though, they're not designed to be taken apart and there's not really much you can do to repair them without the right diagnostic equipment.\" Many of his customers are homeowners without the skills, confidence, time, or frankly, the inclination, to attempt even the most basic of DIY tasks, he reports. \"Lots of people call me just to put a picture up on the wall. My son said to me once, 'Dad, I can't believe people actually pay you just to do that'.\"  Mr King still refers to his trusty manual. \"I got it when I bought my first house,\" he says. \"I didn't have the money to spend on hiring someone to do the work so I had to learn to do it myself.\" He believes people changing lifestyles has led to a general malaise for DIY home improvements.  \"If you're working that hard, you don't want to spend your weekend doing DIY jobs,\" says Mr King. \"So people will ring up a local handyman instead.\" But while Mr King is happy with the status quo - it is keeping him in work - in East Yorkshire, Alan Dalgairns and his Hull Repair Cafe are working on a fix. Here, people can bring in items, which would ordinarily be thrown out, to be fixed - for free - by experienced DIYers. A charge is only applied for parts needed to carry out repairs. Alan Dalgairns fears younger Britons are not learning basic DIY skills    \"People will sit with our repairers while the work is carried out, in the hope that next time they might feel confident to have a go themselves,\" says Mr Dalgairns, 51.  He also thinks skills are not being passed down family lines. Alongside the cafe, Mr Dalgairns runs Hull Library of Stuff, which loans - for a nominal fee - items ranging from extension ladders to angle grinders and chisel sets. \"A lot of younger ones who come in to borrow equipment don't have a clue how it works,\" he says. \"I'll then spend time showing them how to use the item properly and safely.\" \"I think we are losing those basic skills, and I think it's because younger generations are not seeing their parents carrying out these type of jobs.  \"I am a dad to a 10-year-old who watches me repair stuff but we're probably in a minority. \"I'm very much of the mindset what if something is broken, what is the worst that can happen?\" He recalls watching his parents \"mend and make things\". \"I remember coming home from school one day and finding a new chair. My mum had made it from an old bed. My dad would do all the repairs around the house.\" Mr Dalgairns believes many young people today \"don't have a clue what's inside products\". He says: \"They think stuff works using black magic. But what they don't seem to get is that a lot of time something stops working because of something really simple. That's especially true when it comes to sound systems, for example.\" Mr Dalgairns says some young people are turning to social platforms like YouTube for instructional videos \"usually recorded by older people who know what they're doing\". But he believes nothing beats learning practical skills, hands on, from someone experienced. \"That's why we have set up a kids' club, encouraging children to get under the hood and take things apart,\" he says. Mr Dalgairns explains the organisation has teamed up with Dove House, a local hospice, which runs a re-use shop at a council-run household recycling centre. He says they get electrical items that no longer work and encourage children to take them apart and \"examine the various components\". The club is on a hiatus at the moment, says Mr Dalgairns. \"We're confident it'll return next year.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

        "content": "The statue was first erected at Euston station in 1871 A Grade II listed statue of railway pioneer Robert Stephenson is to go on show at a museum.  The bronze 8ft 10in (2.7m) statue of the Northumberland-born engineer will be unveiled at the Locomotion museum in Shildon, County Durham, on Tuesday. It was first erected at Euston station in London in 1871 and was on display until 2020 when it was moved into storage due to HS2 works.  Museum head Sarah Price said she hoped the statue would help \"inspire\" the next generation of engineers from the north-east of England. Robert Stephenson and his father George set up the first company in the world to build commercial steam trains. The firm produced Locomotion No 1 in 1825, the first engine to pull a passenger train on a public railway. Stephenson also developed the London and Birmingham railway which opened in 1838 - the first intercity railway into the capital. The statue has been leased to the museum on a 10-year-deal The statue of Stephenson was designed by Italian sculptor Carlo Marochetti in the 19th Century.  It was on display at Euston for 149 years until it was put into storage. Ms Price said the statue had been leased to the museum for 10 years and had been restored ahead of its unveiling to the public again.  \"It will look pretty much brand new,\" she said.  With all the trains on display at the Locomotion museum, Ms Price said it was \"easy to forget\" the \"human endeavour\" behind the feats of engineering.  \"Having a statue of somebody who was so intimately involved in that kind of early story - it's just easier for people to relate to,\" she said.

        "title": "Mental health: Large rise in NI universities' spending since Covid-19",
        "content": "The amount of money Northern Ireland universities are spending on mental health and wellbeing services for students has increased significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic. Figures received via Freedom of Information requests have revealed the amount of money allocated has increased by an average of more than 40% since 2020. That includes the annual amount for salaries, wellbeing services and counselling. Northern Ireland's mental health champion welcomed the increased spending but called for a joined-up approach with statutory services. Professor Siobhan O'Neill said starting university very often coincided with the age at which most common mental disorders first present themselves. She put an increase in the recorded rates of poor mental health in students down to \"increased financial and social pressure\" as well as a \"reduced stigma and a willingness to ask for help\". \"International students, and those from marginalised communities such as students from black and ethnic minority groups, disabled students and LGBT+ students are at higher risk,\" she added. New mental health champion to 'challenge Stormont' Will a mental health champion make a difference? Ms O'Neill said the increased spending on mental health services \"reflects a recognition of the importance of providing timely access to mental health support to students who are struggling, so that students can fully benefit from higher education, and reduce the risk of dropout\". However, the mental health champion said this support needed to be accompanied by improvements in statutory mental health services. \"For example, a project linking university and statutory services in the Belfast Trust has been very effective, but it needs to be available in other areas of Northern Ireland.\" St Mary's University College, Belfast has seen the biggest increase with an 85.5% rise in spending from Â£124,927 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£231,691 in 2023/24. It said it had also received double its additional funding from the Department for the Economy's Step-Up Project with Â£50,000 in 2023/24 rising to Â£100,000 in 2024/25. This funding, a university spokesperson added, had been used to support the wellbeing of students using one-to-one mentor support and counselling services. Student mental health risk linked to area of study NI students' mental health 'left in the shadows' Stranmillis University College saw a 62% rise over the five years from Â£55,043 in 2020 to Â£89,208 in 2024. It said it operated a free and confidential, permanently-staffed student counselling service and had a qualified occupational health nurse on site. \"College staff operate an 'open door' policy where students are encouraged to make contact and to discuss issues of concern to them,\" the university added. The amount of spending on mental health services at Queen's University Belfast saw a 52% jump from Â£931,615 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£1,417,539 in 2023/24. The university added that there was a wide range of embedded mental health events and initiatives across the academic year for students. Ulster University's spending on mental health services increased 32% from Â£1,916,528 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£2,535,553 in 2023/24. It said the university promoted positive mental health and wellbeing initiatives to all pupils via its student wellbeing team, and offered them access to an external counselling provider. Dara Doyle thinks young men can be reluctant to admit they are struggling with their mental health Dara Doyle, 21, a third year psychology student at Queen's University Belfast, said he first reached out for help in 2023. \"I wasn't able to cope with the pressure of the work that was on me,\" he said. \"I was working part time and quite long hours away from the university and I was having a lot of social isolation. I wasn't feeling myself and knew I needed to talk to someone to make a plan to get back to being myself.\" Dara said he accessed a drop-in service and was then offered six sessions of counselling as well as semi-regular check-ups with his wellbeing support officer. He felt there was still a reluctance among young men to speak about their mental health. \"They are trying to seem strong and hold everything together. There is a social judgement when you speak out and say 'look, I'm actually struggling'.\" Caroline Young hopes wellbeing support can help students learn to mange thei Caroline Young, the vice president for students and corporate services at Queen's University Belfast, said since the pandemic there has been \"a significant change in the support that's needed for the young people\". Some feel anxious about the change to university life, she said, while others have \"potentially much more significant pre-existing conditions, or situations\". Queen's offers online help, a daily drop-in service and one-to one counselling. \"I don't expect it to go away,\" she said.  \"What we hope to be able to do is to ensure that there are lots of ways students can understand how to deal with and support their own well-being.\" Studentsâ mental health âworse since Covidâ Poor mental health affects almost half of UK students 'The law must catch up on student mental health' Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Russia 'ready to reach a deal' on Ukraine as Trump envoy expected to hold talks with Putin Just Stop Oil was policed to extinction - now the movement has gone deeper underground Ukraine 'too risky' and 'Will only work for 40k' Weekly quiz: What kind of bread was crowned Britain's Best Loaf?

        "title": "Why men are so unhealthy - and what can be done",
        "content": "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health â and what can be done about it? Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms. \"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\" The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health â a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.  In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75, external with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents. Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously. He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\" He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\" He says there are biological reasons â the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services. Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally â many go years without seeing a health professional. \"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\" This video can not be played Dr Xand van Tulleken on why more men should go to the doctor's - subtitled version here Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy. \"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\" But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest â a larger gap than is seen for women â and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75. \"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\" NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer. \"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\" NHS health checks are offered to the over 40s every five years and include blood pressure checks Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates. But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work. He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men. Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs. \"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them â they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White. Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes. But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\" He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players. Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities. \"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\" Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes. The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects. Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations â something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 â that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government. But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.  \"Look at your waist size â if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people. \"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\" UK will have men's health strategy, government says Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Video, 00:02:51Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Are we ready for the new male contraceptives?

        "title": "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might",
        "content": "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out. The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades. And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy. Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.  Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax. On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.  There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations. Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely. The basic lesson the White House has taken from history is that high tariffs made America \"great\" the first time Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.  But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board. It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.  The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports. In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisersâ¦ The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\" This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance. The long-term aim is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit down to zero This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.  The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data. While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing. There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.  The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (Â£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech. Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations. There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\". That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world. For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\". In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy. Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down. President Trump's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US doesn't reflect the overall picture, says Faisal Islam Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia. Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south. The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent. Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House. So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this. But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics. The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere. The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices. Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich. The world's consumers have choices. It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem. Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers. Globalisation has failed, according to the current Trump administration Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff. These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US. The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario. In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist. This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US. Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs. For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

        "content": "Abtisam Mohamed (left) and Yuan Yang have now left the country Two Labour MPs say they are \"astounded\" to have been denied entry to Israel while on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank.  Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang said it was \"vital\" parliamentarians were able to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory first-hand. They were refused entry because they intended to \"spread hate speech\" against Israel, the nation's population and immigration authority said. Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised Israeli authorities, describing the move as \"unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning\". But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Israel had a right to \"control its borders\", adding it was \"significant\" there were Labour MPs other countries did not want to let in. Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, and Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, flew to Israel from London Luton Airport with two aides on Saturday afternoon. The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to \"document the security forces\". The Israeli embassy in London said in a statement on Saturday that the country \"will not allow the entry of individuals or entities that act against the state and its citizens\".  It said Mohamed and Yang had \"accused Israel of false claims\" and were \"actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers\".  It also said they had supported campaigns aimed at boycotting the country \"at a time when Israel is at war and under attack on seven fronts\".  The UK Foreign Office said the group was part of a parliamentary delegation. However, Israel's immigration authority said the delegation had not been acknowledged by an Israeli official. The Israeli embassy said the MPs \"were offered hotel accommodation, which they declined\" and the cost of their return flight to the UK was covered.  Israel's Interior Ministry said the MPs left the country early on Sunday.  Mohamed and Yang said their trip had been organised with UK charities that had \"over a decade of experience in taking parliamentary delegations\". \"We are two, out of scores of MPs, who have spoken out in Parliament in recent months on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of complying with international humanitarian law,\" the MPs said in a joint statement.  \"Parliamentarians should feel free to speak truthful in the House of Commons, without fear of being targeted.\" Lammy said the Foreign Office had been in touch with both MPs to offer support, adding: \"I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians.\"  The Council for Arab-British Understanding and Medical Aid for Palestinians - the latter of which is a registered UK charity - said in a joint statement that they had organised the trip. \"This visit was part of that long-standing programme,\" they said. \"When questioned, the group was clear, open and transparent about the aims and objectives of the visit, which included visiting a range of projects run by humanitarian and development organisations operating in the West Bank. \"The group had informed the UK consul general in Jerusalem of their visit and was planning to meet with them as part of the itinerary.\" This video can not be played Watch: \"Countries should be able to control their borders\" - Badenoch on MPs denied entry to Israel Both Yang and Mohamed - who were first elected in 2024 - have made several interventions on the Israel-Hamas conflict in Parliament. In February, Mohamed initiated a cross-party letter, signed by 61 MPs and lords, calling for a ban on goods from Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, citing an opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ). She has also criticised Israel for withholding humanitarian aid from Gaza, telling the House of Commons in October that international law \"prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\", and has mentioned humanitarian organisations' claims of \"ethnic cleansing\" in Gaza. In January, Yang spoke in favour of bringing sanctions against Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, after they suggested building Israeli settlements in northern Gaza to encourage Palestinians to leave. She has also highlighted the dangerous conditions journalists and medical professionals face while in the Palestinian territory. When asked about Israel's decision, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that countries \"should be able to control their borders\".  \"What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour [who] other countries won't allow through,\" Badenoch said. \"I think that's very significant.\"  This video can not be played Watch: Israel decision to deny MPs entry an \"insult to Britain\" - Thornberry Her comments were rebuffed by Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who described Yang and Mohamed as \"highly respected parliamentarians\" and \"potential leaders\". \"Israel is badly advised to try and alienate them, to humiliate them and to treat them in this way,\" she told the programme.  \"I think that it's an insult to Britain and I think it's an insult to Parliament.\" Sir Ed Davey accused Badenoch of \"yet another complete shocker\". The Liberal Democrat leader said she \"has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel\". Lammy called Badenoch's comments \"disgraceful\", asking her: \"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?\" During the war in Gaza, there have been protests, violent incidents and raids by Israeli forces in the West Bank. Hundreds of deaths have been reported there. Israeli troops have been engaged in an extended operation in the occupied Palestinian territory, where two Palestinians were killed on Friday. The current war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 50,000 people have been killed. It said 1,309 people have died since a ceasefire ended on 18 March.

        "title": "Israel admits mistakes over medic killings in Gaza",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: The Palestinian Red Crescent said this video was found on the phone of a paramedic who was killed Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes over the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on 23 March. The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah. Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army. Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire. The mobile video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn. The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. An IDF official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members. When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy \"advancing suspiciously\". When the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire, the official said, despite no evidence any of the emergency team was armed. Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.  The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform. The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road.  They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident. The Israeli military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested. Earlier this week, a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights on and denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group. The IDF promised a \"thorough examination\" of the incident, saying it would \"understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\". The Red Crescent and many other international organisations are calling for an independent investigation. Israel renewed its aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of a ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase stalled. More than 1,200 people have since been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 50,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

        "title": "'Hands Off': Anti-Trump protests gather in cities across the US",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Thousands rally across the US in anti-Trump protests Crowds of protesters gathered in cities across the US on Saturday to denounce President Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.  The \"Hands Off\" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities.  Protesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.  Coming days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin. A protester in London held a toilet scrub brush that bears Trump's likeness Protesters in Paris joined in, holding up signs in English.  In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings.  Law student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month. \"You can stand up today or you can be taken later,\" she said, adding: \"I'm not usually a protest girlie.\" In London, protesters held signs reading, \"WTAF America?\", \"Stop hurting people\" and \"He's an idiot\". They chanted \"hands off Canada\", \"hands off Greenland\" and \"hands off Ukraine\", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce. Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the \"billionaire takeover of our government\". \"When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,\" he shouted. The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points.  In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration's policies and Elon Musk's influence.  A protest was held in West Palm Beach, Florida, nearby to where Trump was golfing Some polls show approval ratings for President Trump to be slipping slightly. One Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week found that his approval rating had dropped to 43%, its lowest point since Trump began his second term in January. When he was inaugurated on 20 January, his approval rating was 47%. The same poll found that 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 30% approve of his strategy to address the cost of living in the US. Another recent poll, from Harvard Caps/Harris, found that 49% of registered voters approve of Trump's performance in office, down from 52% last month. The same poll, however, found that 54% of voters believe he is doing a better job than Joe Biden did as president. One protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because \"we're losing our democratic rights\". \"I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,\" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits.  Asked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: \"Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.\" Trump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday. In Washington, protesters lampooned Trump's move to tariff a penguin-inhabited Australian island Protesters also gathered in Houston, Texas. The White House released a statement defending Trump's positions, saying he would continue to protect programs such as Medicare and pointing to Democrats as the threat. \"President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.\" One of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time.  \"They can protest a vacant house all they want,\" Homan said, adding that their presence \"tied up\" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks. \"Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,\" Homan continued. \"So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights.

        "title": "MP Dan Norris suspended from Labour Party after arrest",
        "content": "MP Dan Norris has been arrested on suspicion of rape, child sex offences, child abduction and misconduct in a public office.  The Labour Party says it \"immediately suspended\" the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham after being made aware of his arrest.  Avon and Somerset Police confirmed that a man in his 60s was arrested on Friday and released on conditional bail. BBC News has contacted Norris for comment. Norris, 65, was elected as the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham in 2024, defeating the Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. He had previously been in Parliament from 1997 to 2010 representing the seat of Wansdyke.  The MP was a junior minister under Gordon Brown and was an assistant whip under Tony Blair. Norris has also served as the Mayor of the West of England since 2021 but is due to step down ahead of May's local elections. According to the West of England Combined Authority website, Norris previously worked as an NSPCC-trained child protection officer. In a statement, Avon and Somerset Police said: \"In December 2024, we received a referral from another police force relating to alleged non-recent child sex offences having been committed against a girl. \"Most of the offences are alleged to have occurred in the 2000s but we're also investigating an alleged offence of rape from the 2020s. \"An investigation, led by officers within Operation Bluestone, our dedicated rape and serious sexual assault investigation team, remains ongoing and at an early stage. \"The victim is being supported and given access to any specialist help or support she needs. \"A man, aged in his 60s, was arrested on Friday (April 4) on suspicion of sexual offences against a girl (under the Sexual Offences Act 1956), rape (under the Sexual Offences Act 2003), child abduction and misconduct in a public office.  \"He's been released on conditional bail for enquiries to continue.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said on Saturday: \"Dan Norris MP was immediately suspended by the Labour Party upon being informed of his arrest. \"We cannot comment further while the police investigation is ongoing.\" The suspension means Mr Norris, the MP for North East Somerset and Hanham, is also understood to have had the party whip suspended, meaning he is not able to sit as a Labour MP in the Commons.

        "title": "UK cosmetic surgery trends: body contouring and anti-wrinkles",
        "content": "Treatments to remove wrinkles and tone arms, thighs and stomachs are driving a rise in cosmetic surgery, the latest figures, external from UK private clinics suggest. There were 27,462 procedures performed in 2024 - a 5% rise on 2023 - of which more than nine in ten were on women. Boob jobs remained the most popular treatment, followed by breast reduction surgery in second place. But much of the rise was driven by increases in facial rejuvenation surgery, such as face and brow lifts and body contouring procedures like liposuction and tummy tucks, according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS). The association's president said surgery has become cheaper and easier to access, while some patients say there is less stigma around cosmetic procedures. The most popular cosmetic surgeries, with their change from 2023 to 2024, are: Boob job (up 6%) Breast reduction (up 1%) Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery (up 13%) Abdominoplasty, or tummy tucks (up 6%) Liposuction, or fat removal (up 8%) Rhinoplasty, or nose jobs (down 1%) Face/neck lift (up 8%) Fat transfer (up 5%) Breast implant removal (down 5%) Otoplasty, or ear correction (up 2%) There was also a 24% rise in thigh lifts, and a 13% increase in brachioplasty, or \"bingo wing\" removal. Non-surgical procedures like botox and fillers were also popular: nearly 10,000 were performed by BAAPS members in 2024. But \"designer vagina\" labiaplasty surgery, which changes the shape or size of the labia, appeared less popular, with the number carried out down by 7%. Nugent said that cosmetic surgery had become \"more accessible\", and while she acknowledged that treatments still were expensive, she said that they had become a bit more affordable. This has coincided with a \"shift in attitude\" towards cosmetic procedures over the past decade because of a movement in society \"towards wellness and looking after oneself\", she said. Cosmetic surgery is \"more normalised\", she added. Some of the growth in cosmetic surgery is also caused by people who previously had non-surgical procedures, like filler and Botox, now choosing to go under the knife because they were getting \"fatigue\" from repeatedly going to clinics to get the work done, Nugent said. And the rise of weight-loss injections such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro have played a role, too. Nugent said that some people taking these medications, also known as \"skinny jabs\", are getting surgery on their face. \"As they lose weight they start to notice deflation and some sagging of their face,\" she said. The BAAPS statistics do not show how many people have surgery after taking weight-loss drugs, but Nugent said that of the patients she has treated, \"more and more\" are people taking the medications. People have cosmetic surgery for a wide range of reasons. Kirsten White, 33, a talent acquisition specialist from Sheffield, had a breast reduction and uplift after losing weight with a gastric sleeve. She said her \"breasts were basically down to my bellybutton\" before surgery, leading to backache and the need for physiotherapy, she said. \"I don't think people are surprised when I tell them I've had cosmetic surgery because I think it's pretty normal now,\" she said.  \"There's not so much the stigma that there used to be that it's really taboo and people are a lot more supportive of doing what will make you feel happy.\" Kirsten White says there's less stigma about people getting cosmetic procedures Men underwent 1,799 surgical procedures in 2024, a slight drop from 2023 - making up just 6.6% of all surgeries in the BAAPS dataset. Nose jobs (rhinoplasty) remained the most popular among men, with 332 surgeries done in 2024, which is a 14% drop on 2023. Face and neck lifts increased by 26%, with 140 done in 2024, suggesting a growing interest in anti-aging procedures among men - though Nugent said it was harder to spot trends for men due to the smaller numbers treated. Beauty standards are shaped by social media and celebrity culture, said Dr Beth Daniels, director of the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol.  The pandemic also caused a shift, when the move towards video calls \"heightened our awareness of our appearance\" because people saw their own faces on their computer screens. Dr Daniels said that society places value on youthful looks, which could push some women to get cosmetic procedures. \"As women age, they're often discounted in a number of ways\" and are \"made to feel invisible in society\", she said. BAAPS vice president Anthony Macquillan suggested the overall increase in facelifts could be linked to societal changes, such as the rising pension age. He said: \"For many, this type of surgery is not just aesthetic but also functional, helping to maintain confidence, secure employment, and reduce anxiety associated with age-related bias.\" The BAAPS data is based on statistics from 233 of its members. Jim Frame, president of the UK Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and professor at Anglia Ruskin University, said that it does not cover all of the cosmetic surgery operations that happen in the UK because some is carried out by ENT and maxillofacial surgeons, or by non-BAAPS members, especially fillers and Botox. The data also does not include surgeries carried out overseas, where the lower cost of treatment in countries like Turkey attracts Brits.  Cosmetic procedures and surgery carry risks and the NHS warns that they \"can lead to serious complications if they're not done correctly\".  It advises people to research thoroughly beforehand, including checking the credibility of the clinic and getting information about the most common complications of the procedure. \"There are a lot of susceptible people that are committing to surgeries that a fairly large proportion will regret,\" Prof Frame said.

        "content": "Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\" after tariffs were imposed earlier this week. A 25% levy on car imports came into force on Thursday, one of several measures announced by US President Donald Trump which have sent shockwaves through global supply chains. The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union. In a statement, a Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said the company was \"taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans\". The Coventry-based car manufacturer - which also has sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton - said the US is an \"important market for JLR's luxury brands\". More cars are exported to the US from the UK than any other goods. In a 12-month period up to the end of the third quarter of 2024, the trade was worth Â£8.3bn, according to the UK trade department, external. An initial wave of tariffs on cars came into effect from 3 April, with import taxes on auto parts due to follow next month. Starmer vows to protect UK businesses from tariff 'storm' Globalisation era has ended, says Treasury minister Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy Car maker Nissan is thinking about moving some of its production of US-bound vehicles from Japan to the US as early as this summer, financial newspaper Nikkei has reported. Earlier this week Nissan said it would keep two production shifts at its plant in Tennessee, after announcing plans to scale back operations there in January. Meanwhile, carmaker Stellantis has said it will temporarily shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, a Canadian city on the US border, next week due to the new tariffs. The United Auto Workers union - which represents those working in car manufacturing in the United States and southern Ontario, Canada - has applauded the introduction of tariffs, saying the move \"signals a return to policies that prioritise the workers who build this country, rather than the greed of ruthless corporations\" A separate 10% tariff will be imposed on all other UK imports, with higher rates in place for some other major economies. Global stock markets have incurred heavy losses in recent days as firms grapple with how to adapt to the new trading environment. The FTSE 100 - which measures the performance of the 100 leading firms listed on the London Stock Exchange - plummeted by 4.9% on Friday, its steepest fall since the start of the pandemic.  Exchanges in Germany and France also saw similar declines. Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will take a calm approach to the trade tariffs and has ruled out \"jumping into a trade war\". He warned \"the world as we knew it has gone\" but said he was prepared to use industrial policy to \"shelter British business from the storm\". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, external, Sir Keir said he will continue to seek a trade deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, but mooted state intervention to protect the national interest. Sir Keir is holding talks with other European leaders to discuss how to respond to the White House's trade moves. The prime minister spoke to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, the first of several discussions planned between Sir Keir and European leaders over the weekend. Downing Street said Sir Keir and Macron had agreed \"a trade war was in nobody's interest\" but \"nothing should be off the table\".

I can't see my boys playing rugby and soccer,\" the 78-year-old superstar told The Times, external. \"It has been a very stressful time because I'm used to soaking it all up.

I still have my wonderful family, and I can still see something out of here,\" he said, pointing at his left eye. \"So you say to yourself, just get on with it.\" Sir Elton John pictured during his headline set at Glastonbury in 2023 Sir Elton previously said he'd been unable to finish his new album due to his eyesight issues.

The pair worked with producer Andrew Watt and his long-term songwriting partner Bernie Taupin on the album. Sir Elton said that they \"didn't all agree\", adding that he became \"frustrated\" when they stood up to him. He said: \"If I want to make a great album aged 76 or 77 I've got to be told and they put up with my little foibles, which were really about anxiety, self-doubt and not feeling very well at the time.  \"I was tired so I thought, I'm going to abandon this. \"The problem was three other people were involved and I knew that if I walked away from it I would hate myself for the rest of my life.\" He added that it is not the first time he has had doubts about his music. \"You wouldn't be human if you didn't have fear and doubt.

Writing in the Guardian, Lisa Wright awarded it four stars, external, praising its \"poignant moments\", while The Telegraph's Neil McCormick gave it five stars, external, calling it a \"glorious return to his bombastic, melodious 1970s pomp\".

        "title": "Video footage appears to contradict Israeli account of Gaza medic killings",
        "content": "This video can not be played  Mobile phone footage has emerged that appears to contradict Israel's account of why soldiers opened fire on a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck on March 23, killing 15 rescue workers.  The video, published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), shows the vehicles moving in darkness with headlights and emergency flashing lights switched on - before coming under fire. The PRCS said the video was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially denied the vehicles had their headlights or emergency signals on.  But in response to the new video, the IDF told the BBC: \"All claims, including the documentation circulating about the incident, will be thoroughly and deeply examined to understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\". A surviving paramedic previously told the BBC that the ambulances were clearly marked and had their internal and external lights on.  The latest video, which the PRCS said had been shown to the UN Security Council, shows the marked vehicles drawing to a halt on the edge of the road, lights still flashing, and at least two emergency workers stepping out wearing reflective clothing. The windscreen of the vehicle being filmed from is cracked and shooting can then be heard lasting for several minutes as the person filming says prayers. He is understood to be one of the dead paramedics. The footage was found on his phone after his body was recovered from a shallow grave one week after the incident. The bodies of the eight paramedics, six Gaza Civil Defence workers and one UN employee were found buried in sand, along with their wrecked vehicles. It took international organisations days to negotiate safe access to the site. Israel claimed a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants had been killed in the incident, but it has not provided any evidence or further explained the threat to its troops. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar earlier this week echoed the army account, saying \"the IDF did not randomly attack an ambulance\". The IDF promised to investigate the circumstances after a surviving paramedic questioned its account.  In an interview with the BBC, paramedic Munther Abed said: \"During day and at night, it's the same thing. External and internal lights are on. Everything tells you it's an ambulance vehicle that belongs to the Palestinian Red Crescent. All lights were on until the vehicle came under direct fire.\" He also denied he or his team had any militant connections. \"All crews are civilian. We don't belong to any militant group. Our main duty is to offer ambulance services and save people's lives. No more, no less,\" he said. Speaking at the United Nations yesterday the President of the PRCS, Dr Younis Al-Khatib, referred to the video recording, saying: \"I heard the voice of one of those team members who was killed.

        "content": "Jason Bell has used a wheelchair for two and a half years and says it's hard to get into some music venues in Nottingham \"It's frustrating knowing there's gigs on that I know people are going to but I can't,\" says Jason Bell, who's been in a wheelchair for the last two and a half years. He says wheelchair users have to miss out on gigs in Nottingham, because some venues, including Rock City and The Bodega, are not accessible.  The 55-year-old, who lives in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, injured his spinal cord three years ago while lifting boxes when \"something just snapped in my back\". A spokesperson for DHP Family, which runs Rock City and The Bodega, said they were committed to making their venues as accessible as possible and added everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy live music. Jason says The Bodega in Nottingham could be hard to make accessible because of its small size \"It's taken me a while to go back and see live music,\" Jason said. \"I missed the Sex Pistols last year, there's a gig on nearly every night at The Bodega that friends are going to and I've got no way of getting in.\" Jason said after researching the issue, as far as he can see, Rock City is \"the largest [music] venue in the UK without full disabled access\". \"There's a few wheelchairs that can get in, light, manual ones, but anything a little bit bigger, or battery [powered] wheelchairs can't get in,\" he added. \"Even if you did go in, there's no disabled loos or anything like that.\" Jason says he's missing out on gigs at Rock City Jason said he first contacted Rock City six months ago raising concerns about a lack of accessibility in the building, and was told there could be a solution.  \"This has been going on years and years. They've promised things and it's never come up,\" he said. \"I just cannot get into Rock City. I've spoken to other people in the same position. \"Everywhere else, even down to Rough Trade, I can get into. I'm able to get into Rescue Rooms and the staff are brilliant. \"Rock City is the big one, it has the bigger bands.\" Jason says music is his \"biggest passion\" and is the main way he makes friends and socialises. \"It's pretty hard work in a wheelchair, and music makes me forget about anything,\" he said. \"I grew up going to shows. Seeing the curtain rise, or the band strike up is ingrained in my DNA.\" Jason says there are several key things that music venues need to be fully accessible.  \"Flat access that can be used on your own, ramps small enough to wheel yourself up, reliable lifts that will get you up and down every floor,\" he said. \"We also need a viewing area you can use where you don't have to look behind people and access to bars and toilets. \"There's a lot more planning than just buying a ticket. \"I just want equality and to be able to get into venues like everyone else.\" Jason recently saw The Hoosiers at Rescue Rooms in Nottingham The DHP Family spokesperson said plans had been drawn up to provide disabled lift access to Rock City. They added: \"As a company, we are working with Attitude is Everything to do all we can to improve access for all audiences, and always welcome insight and feedback from our customers on what we can do better.\" The spokesperson says wheelchair users can access the Main Hall using the stair climber purchased in 2020. At The Bodega, they say wheelchair users can access the ground floor bar and garden bar, where there is also a disabled toilet.

        "title": "Margot Robbie seen filming Wuthering Heights in Yorkshire Dales",
        "content": "Margot Robbie has taken the lead role in a new adaptation of Wuthering Heights Rural North Yorkshire is having its Hollywood moment.  The latest production to be filmed in the region is a new adaptation of the classic novel Wuthering Heights, which has just finished shooting in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It stars Australian actress Margot Robbie, who recently took the lead role in Barbie, and will play Cathy alongside Jacob Elordi's Heathcliff. Emily Bronte's novel was written in 1847 and set in the rugged Yorkshire moors. The locations chosen for the new film included Arkengarthdale, Swaledale and the village of Low Row. Robbie, 35, stayed at the hotel Simonstone Hall, near Hawes, with other cast members. She was also photographed in a white wedding gown surrounded by film crew for a scene believed to be her marriage to Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton. Fashion bible Vogue has criticised her dress as being historically inaccurate, as the style was only popularised by Queen Victoria 40 years after the story is set. Margot Robbie even signed some autographs at the hotel where she stayed  The hotel is a \"historic country lodge\" where presenter Jeremy Clarkson famously attacked a Top Gear producer in 2015.  A staff member said Robbie was \"very lovely\" and even enjoyed a Sunday roast and afternoon tea there with her husband and new baby.  The employee told the BBC: \"The weekend was great fun, where she met lots of other guests and visitors and she introduced her baby to the resident pigs and peacocks here.\"  The film crew's base camp was near Holiday Home Yorkshire in Reeth.  The letting company's owner said it was \"very exciting\" seeing the trailers in the tiny village.  One local holiday let owner said he saw Robbie driving a tractor with her co-star - although the agricultural vehicles were not invented until the late 19th Century. He said: \"There were four tractors, old-fashioned open-to-the-elements style and they were being escorted by two Range Rovers.\" Another Dales resident said he had seen filming at Surrender Bridge, which is close to an old lead smelting mill. The landmark also featured in the opening scene of the BBC series All Creatures Great and Small in the 1980s and is on the Coast to Coast path route. The film's base camp was located in rural Arkengarthdale  Crew members also stayed at the Charles Bathurst Inn, in Arkengarthdale, and were described as \"very friendly\".  The film, directed by Emerald Fennell, is due for release in February 2026.  There are hopes that it will lead to an upsurge in interest in the Bronte sisters and their work. The director of the Bronte Parsonage Museum, a literary museum located at the former Bronte family home in Haworth, West Yorkshire, said: \"Every screen or theatre adaptation brings something fresh for contemporary audiences to think about.  \"It is a testimony of Emily's legacy that her writing continues to inspire creatives today and we look forward to seeing what Emerald Fennell's adaptation adds to the mix.\"  Haworth Parsonage is where Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights and lived with her sisters Charlotte and Anne, and it was gifted to the Bronte Society in 1928.  This video can not be played Listen: Margot Robbie spotted filming in Yorkshire Dales It has the largest collection of BrontÃ« items in the world.  Director Rebecca Yorke added: \"We're also delighted that some filming has taken place at nearby locations and hope that this will attract new visitors to the area and to the BrontÃ« Parsonage Museum.\"  There have been at least 10 film and television adaptations of Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte's only novel.  One of the most well-known was the 1939 version starring Merle Oberon as Cathy and Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Rebel Wilson said she was 'loving it' in Yorkshire Other high-profile actors who have played Heathcliff over the years include Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Richard Burton.  Meanwhile, North Yorkshire was also the filming location for a Christmas film starring Rebel Wilson and Kiefer Sutherland.  Tinsel Town will be released in December 2025 and was shot in Knaresborough. Wilson, 45, said at the time she \"loved\" the area and had been practising her Yorkshire accent.  In 2021, Tom Cruise surprised locals of Pickering when he touched down in a helicopter to shoot scenes for Mission: Impossible at a heritage railway.  The owner of a local B&B said in a Facebook post they had been walking the dog when they \"bumped into\" the Hollywood megastar.

The waste was found on the Everest Playing Fields in Ashby near Scunthorpe. One of the refuse collectors, Jayne Eaton, described the field of faeces as \"pretty grotty\". \"It's a shame because it's a lovely field, \" she said. \"There's a children's park over there and it's just a shame for the community and the local residents.\" Ms Eaton said the Scunthorpe Litter Pickers group posted a picture of the bags on social media to try and give dogwalkers \"a bit of a conscience\". \"It was an idea to promote awareness and just make people feel a little bit guilty when it's out there to see,\" she said. Jayne Eaton says she hopes the social media post would give dog walkers \"a bit of a conscience\" The volunteers cleared the playground only to find freshly discarded bags of waste the next day. Ms Eaton said the group had discovered other items during their cleaning sessions, including a crisp packet dating back to 2002.

        "title": "Tariffs welcomed in Ohio's industrial Trump country",
        "content": "On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners. And at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: \"Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!\" This is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans. Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue. For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates. \"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\" Miller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods. Mary Miller looks out from behind the counter at her sweet shop in downtown Delta As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since. Miller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring. \"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said. \"If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.\" Follow live: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality These sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks. The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts. But on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism. One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal. The North Star Bluescope on the edge of Delta runs around the clock and has recently undergone expansion North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning. The workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday. It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend. Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes. \"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry. Although he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement. \"If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,\" he said. Gene Burkholder regularly stops by the Barn Restaurant for breakfast - no matter what the stock market is doing A couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president. But Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: \"Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.\" \"The other people wouldn't have done squat,\" she said, referring to the Democratic Party. The Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie. And as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks. \"It was a good little town to grow up in,\" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s.  \"It seems like the heart of America is gone,\" he said. Delta, Louise Gilson added, \"is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons\". And while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.

        "title": "Excel Parking ordered to pay £10,240 in five-minute parking rule row",
        "content": "Hannah Robinson was asked to pay Â£11,390 despite her paying for parking A car park operator that demanded Â£11,390 in parking charges from a driver has lost a court case and been ordered to pay thousands in costs. Excel Parking, which has been criticised for charging drivers Â£100 if they took more than five minutes to pay at a car park in Derby, has been doing the same in Darlington. Hannah Robinson, 21, was among those to be caught out and received hundreds of letters demanding money, as well as repeated phone calls. Excel Parking eventually took her to court for some of the parking charge notices (PCNs), but a judge has now dismissed the claim and told the firm to pay Â£10,240.10 in costs to charity.  \"Following the court hearing I feel relieved and a massive weight has lifted from my shoulders,\" said Miss Robinson. \"It has been extremely stressful and frustrating; I constantly worried what letters I was receiving or who was going to knock at the door after the threats.\" Miss Robinson had free legal representation at the hearing on 26 March but the judge made a pro bono costs order, meaning Excel Parking will have to pay thousands in costs to a charity called the Access to Justice Foundation. This was the amount her legal team from Keidan Harrison spent defending the case. \"I feel happy that they [Excel Parking] are getting a taste of what it felt like for me,\" said Miss Robinson. Excel Parking Services Ltd told the BBC it did not want to comment as it was appealing. Miss Robinson was asked to pay Â£11,390 for 67 parking charge notices Miss Robinson said the problems began for her in June 2021, when she started parking at the Feethams Leisure car park in Darlington, as she worked in a restaurant above it. She said she paid each time but it sometimes took longer than five minutes due to poor phone signal and problems with the payment app. \"I started getting a couple of fines, and I was young and had just started driving, so I would pay them because I was scared,\" said Miss Robinson, from Stockton-on-Tees. She continued using the car park, despite the problems, because it was the safest one to use as a young woman on her own at night. \"There was actually a lift from that car park up to my workplace,\" she said. \"I worked unsociable hours, I finished late, sometimes midnight or one in the morning, it was just the safest option for me to go down there.\" These are just some of the parking charge notices and letters that Miss Robinson received She decided to start appealing against the charges towards the end of 2022, but Excel still wanted her to pay. \"I'd been begging to speak to them, constant emails,\" she said. \"I've got threads and threads of nobody wanting to communicate with me, and I was asking for so much help to try and sort this out.\" She eventually received a letter, in February 2024, asking her to pay 67 unpaid charges. Each one was Â£100, plus a Â£70 debt collection fee, so the total was Â£11,390. She then broke down and told her family what had been happening. \"I couldn't believe it,\" said her nan, Adrienne Atkin. \"I couldn't believe the amount, and I couldn't believe a company could do that, so I was shocked.\" Mrs Atkin then started trying to help her granddaughter. \"It's almost been a full-time job trying to keep on top of everything, and it's very easy for people to give up,\" said Mrs Atkin. \"It had an effect on a young girl that shouldn't have happened, when she should be out working, having fun. \"At some point Hannah just stayed in her bedroom. When her phone rang she was on edge because she didn't know if it was going to be them.\" Miss Robinson said she struggled to pay within five minutes due to poor signal in the car park Miss Robinson eventually received a court claim asking her to pay two of the Â£100 PCNs, plus a Â£70 debt collection for each, and various other costs. Excel Parking later applied to amend this claim so they could pursue 11 different PCNs. But at the hearing, District Judge Janine Richards dismissed this application, and also dismissed the original claim. She found Excel's \"conduct in relation to this litigation was both unreasonable and out of the norm\", and therefore ordered the firm to pay the winning party's legal costs of Â£10,240.10. Miss Robinson said she was grateful to her solicitors, Luke Harrison and Anya Prasad. \"I am overwhelmed with the support I have received,\" said Miss Robinson. \"The hearing was very tense but I'm glad the judge saw through them. \"I am upset with the way they have treated me and I hope this stops them going after innocent people.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Derby Follow BBC Derby on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.

        "title": "Swapped at birth: How a home DNA test finally revealed the truth",
        "content": "Susan was no more than puzzled when she saw the first results from her home DNA testing kit. Now a woman in her mid 70s, she had never known much about her grandfather, and paid for the private test to see if it threw up anything unusual. \"I did notice there was a lot of Irish heritage, which as far as I knew was wrong,\" she says. \"But I just pushed it aside and didn't think any more of it. I stopped paying for my subscription and that was that.\" Except it very much wasn't. It took another six years for Susan - not her real name - to realise everything she knew about her family history was wrong. She later found out that back in the 1950s, she had been swapped at birth for another baby girl in a busy NHS maternity ward. Her case is now the second of its type uncovered by the BBC. Lawyers say they expect more to come forward driven by the boom in cheap genetic testing and ancestry websites. A sharp, funny woman with shoulder-length white hair, Susan tells me her story from her sunny front room somewhere in southern England. Her husband is sitting next to her, jogging her memory and chipping in from time to time. After taking that DNA test almost a decade ago, the genealogy company entered her data into its vast family tree, allowing other users to make contact with their genetic relatives â close or distant. Six years later she received a message out of the blue. The stranger said that his data matched hers in a way that could only mean one thing: he must be her genetic sibling. \"That was just panic. It was every emotion I could think of, my brain was all over the place,\" she says. Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother. He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant. Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family. Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born. The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website. It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago. In the 1950s and 60s babies were often cared for by midwives in large nurseries in NHS hospitals. Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries. The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay. In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives. \"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan. \"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\" From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS. Susan grew up believing her mother and father were her biological parents and only realised the truth after taking a home DNA test This, of course, meant nothing to Susan for decades. She grew up as part of a \"normal, working class\" household, met her husband and ended up working for the NHS herself in a \"hands-on\" clinical role. Other than \"a bit of the usual trauma\" in her teenage years, she remembers her parents as a \"very good, loving\" couple who \"did everything they could and always encouraged me\". \"In a way, I'm so glad they are not here anymore to see this,\" says Susan. \"If they are up there watching me, I really hope they don't know what's gone on.\" If home DNA tests had been available earlier, she doesn't think she could have told them the truth \"because it would have been so awful\". \"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says. On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through. \"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says. \"Both he and his wife have been absolutely fantastic, honestly I cannot praise them enough.\" She remembers receiving another \"lovely letter\" from a cousin at the time who told her, \"Oh don't worry, you're still part of the family\". As for her new blood relations, she says the situation has been more difficult. She has met up with the man who contacted her, her biological sibling, and laughs as she remembers how similar they both looked. \"If you'd put a wig on him and a bit of makeup, it could honestly have been me,\" she jokes. She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons. But building a relationship with that new side of her family has not been easy. \"I know they are my biological relatives but I didn't grow up with them so there's not that emotional connection there,\" she says. \"They closed ranks, basically, through loyalty to their sister which is admirable and I understand.\" Susan's genetic parents died some years ago but she's been told she looks like her biological mother. \"I'd still like to know a bit more about her â what she was like and all that â but I never will, so there you go,\" she says. \"But if I take the emotion out of it, and just think logically and clearly, I was better off how I grew up.\" Susan is one of the first to ever receive compensation - the amount is not being disclosed - in a case like this. She needed to take a second DNA test before the NHS trust involved accepted its historic mistake and made a \"very lovely\" apology. Last year, the BBC reported on another decades-old case of babies swapped at birth, which again came to light after someone was given a DNA testing kit for Christmas. Susan says the settlement was never about money but the recognition a mistake had been made all those years ago. \"I suppose you always want someone to blame, don't you?\" she asks. \"But I know this will be with me for the rest of my life.

        "title": "Trump extends deadline to keep TikTok running in US",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark',\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\" The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance. Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday. The social media platform, which says it has more than 170 million users in the US, must close in the US under a law passed by Congress - unless a buyer is found. In a statement on Friday, ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but \"an agreement has not been executed\". \"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" a spokesperson said.  Former US President Joe Biden's administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation. Congress passed a bipartisan law last year that gave ByteDance six months to sell its controlling stake in TikTok or see the app blocked in the US. Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open. The new extension comes as the Trump administration tries to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership, and keep the popular app running in the US.  \"The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday. Who might buy TikTok as ban deadline looms? Amazon joins bidders A TikTok deal was reportedly nearly finalised on Wednesday, but fell apart after Trump on the same day announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China. ByteDance representatives contacted the White House to inform them China would no longer approve the deal unless negotiations on the tariffs could take place, a source familiar with the deal told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The unnamed source said the plan had been for Trump to sign an order initiating a 120-day period for closing the deal, allowing time to finish paperwork and secure financing.  The agreement had won approval from existing investors, new investors, ByteDance, and the US government, but China backed out once Trump imposed the global import taxes, CBS reports. The Chinese embassy in Washington DC said in a statement that it \"opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy\". This video can not be played Watch: Can young Americans live without TikTok? China faces a 54% aggregate tariff on goods imported into the US, and has retaliated with 34% in counter tariffs. Reports suggest several potential buyers for TikTok have cropped up in recent days. Amazon has put in a last-minute offer to the White House to acquire the platform, according to the BBC's US partner CBS, though the firm has declined comment. Several other potential buyers include billionaire Frank McCourt, together with Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary. Alexis Ohanian, who co-founded Reddit, has said he has joined Mr McCourt's bid. Computing giant Microsoft, private equity giant Blackstone, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and search engine Perplexity AI are also reportedly in the running for a stake. TrumpÂ hasÂ saidÂ hisÂ administrationÂ wasÂ inÂ touchÂ withÂ four separate groups interested in a potentialÂ TikTokÂ deal, though he has not named them.  Vice-President JD Vance is spearheading the administration's effort to find a buyer. The president has also suggested the US could offer a deal where China agrees to approve a TikTok sale in exchange for relief from US tariffs on Chinese imports. \"We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added that the trade levies are \"the most powerful economic tool, and every important to our national security\".

        "title": "Falklands surprised to be on Trump's 'worst offenders' tariff list",
        "content": "Fish is the main good exported by the Falkland Islands The Falkland Islands was surprised to be hit by one of the most punishing tariff rates on US President Donald Trump's \"worst offenders\" list, a member of the Falklands parliament has told the BBC. The British overseas territory is facing a 42% tax on the goods it exports to the US under Trump's shake-up of international trade. Teslyn Barkman, who oversees trade in the parliament, said the taxes would impact the economy, which is heavily dependent on the sale of fish to the EU and the US. But Barkman said the Falklands government would not respond with retaliatory tariffs and wanted a \"warm\" relationship with the US. Only eight other countries or territories dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances were given higher rates on Trump's list of tariffs, which are due to come into effect on Wednesday. \"It was a surprise,\" Barkman told the BBC. \"The fact a global superpower such as the US was paying attention to us at all caught us off guard.\" With a population of about 3,600 people, the Falkland Islands is an archipelago located in the South Atlantic Ocean. The territory has a government and sets its own trade policy, while the UK takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs. In 2023, the Falklands government reported a national income of Â£280m, with fishing accounting for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP). \"We're a village running a country,\" said Barkman, who holds responsibility for trade and economic development in the Legislative Assembly. \"So the sum of our trade exports is massive in terms of GDP.\" In 2023, the Falklands exported $27.4m (Â£21.2m) of goods to the US, mostly non-fillet frozen fish, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), external. In contrast, the OEC said the US exported $329,000 (Â£255,000) of goods to the Falklands. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to urgently meet Falklands Governor Alison Blake to discuss the impact of the tariffs. Sir Ed said the UK must include the interests of the Falkland Islands in its trade negotiations with the US. \"Trump's trade war could be the biggest threat facing Falklanders since Argentina's invasion,\" Sir Ed said. \"The UK government has a responsibility to step up and defend British citizens everywhere â including in the Falklands. \"President Trump has arbitrarily decided to hit Falklanders with some of his highest tariffs in an outrageous act of aggression that cannot be allowed to stand.\" Teslyn Barkman is the trade representative in the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands Barkman said the Falklands was still trying to figure out why Trump decided to levy a 42% tariff on its goods. The US imposed a 10% tariff on UK products. As analysis by BBC Verify showed, the tariffs are based on a calculation that factors in the difference in goods traded between the US and other countries. \"We're certainly not looking at any anything retaliatory at all,\" Barkman said.  \"We need to understand how that figure was arrived at because certainly the Falkland Islands approach has been that we're here to support the UK and her Western allies. She added: \"We want a warm relationship with the US as well.\" She said tourism was also a big contributor to the territory's economy, with large numbers of Amercians coming to see the renowned penguins living on the Falklands. \"Maybe that's an opportunity for us to build a closer relationship,\" Barkman said. She said the Falklands was working with the UK government to understand how the US tariff could be reduced or removed. EU tariffs on fish from the Falklands are a similarly pressing issue, given that is where the vast majority of those exports go. \"We're very aware that the EU and the UK are approaching reset talks and there might be an opportunity there to support our economy as well and the removal of EU tariffs against Falkland Islands products,\" Barkman said. The BBC understands Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty spoke with a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly on Thursday and will be engaging with affected overseas territories over the coming weeks.

        "content": "Five-year-old Ronin has helped Cambodians reclaim land that was once avoided for fear of landmines A landmine-detecting rat in Cambodia has set a new world record to become the first rodent to uncover more than 100 mines and other deadly war remnants. Ronin, an African giant pouched rat, has uncovered 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance since 2021, charity Apopo, which trains the animals, said in a statement. Cambodia remains littered with millions of unexploded munitions following about 20 years of civil war that ended in 1998. The Guinness Book of World Records said that Ronin's \"crucial work\" is making a real difference to people who have had to live with the \"fear that one misstep while going about their day-to-day lives could be their last.\" Apopo, which is based in Tanzania, currently has 104 rodent recruits, or HeroRATS, as the non-profit likes to call them. The rats are trained to sniff out  chemicals that are found in landmines and other weapons abandoned on battlefields. Because of their small size, the rats are not heavy enough to detonate the mines. The rats can check an area the size of a tennis court in about 30 minutes, the charity says, whereas a human with a metal detector might take four days to clear the same land. They can also detect tuberculosis, an infectious disease that commonly affects the lungs, far quicker than it would be found in a lab, external using conventional microscopy, Apopo says. It takes about one year to train each rat to detect unexploded landmines Ronin's impressive work in Cambodia's northern Preah Vihear province has surpassed the previous record held Magawa, a rat who sniffed out 71 mines and was presented with a gold medal for his heroism in 2020. Since Apopo's work began 25 years ago, the organisation has cleared 169,713 landmines and other explosives worldwide - more than 52,000 have been in Cambodia. The charity also works in other countries affected by war, including Ukraine, South Sudan and Azerbaijan. There are still an estimated four to six million landmines and other exploded munitions buried in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor.

        "content": "The attack on Kryvyi Rih is one of the deadliest Russian strikes on Ukraine this year A Russian missile attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has killed at least 18 people and left dozens wounded, Ukrainian officials have said. Nine of the dead were children, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, who grew up in Kryvyi Rih. Local officials said a ballistic missile had hit a residential area.  Images showed at least one victim lying in a playground, while a video showed a large section of a 10-storey block of flats destroyed and victims lying on the road. Russia's defence ministry later claimed a \"high-precision missile strike\" had targeted a meeting of \"unit commanders and Western instructors\" in a restaurant, and that up to 85 were killed. It provided no evidence. Ukraine's military responded by saying that Russia was spreading false information to try to \"cover up its cynical crime\". It said Moscow had fired an Iskander-M ballistic missile with a cluster warhead to maximise casualties. The attack, early on Friday evening, was among the deadliest on Kryvyi Rih since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, and comes as US President Donald Trump pushes for a ceasefire. Zelensky wrote on social media that at least five buildings had been damaged in Friday's strike: \"There is only one reason why this continues: Russia doesn't want a ceasefire, and we see it.\" The head of Kryvyi Rih's defence, Oleksandr Vilkul, said a residential area was hit. \"The missile exploded in the air... to injure more people,\" he said. \"Children were killed on or near a playground.\" Serhii Lysak, the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located, said more than 40 people were treated for wounds, and the youngest was only three months old. Later on Friday, Vilkul reported more explosions, saying the city was under a \"mass\" drone attack that triggered fires in at least four locations. He said one elderly woman burned to death in a private house hit by a drone. Another five people were injured elsewhere. Military chiefs from both the UK and France met Zelensky in Kyiv earlier in the day to discuss plans for foreign peacekeepers to be stationed in Ukraine as part of a potential ceasefire deal. But there has been little sign of a let-up in the violence. Kryvyi Rih also came under attack earlier this week when a building in the centre was struck, leaving four people dead.  On Thursday, Russian drone strikes on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv claimed another five lives, local officials said. US says Putin will make decision on ceasefire in 'weeks, not months' Rosenberg: Trump takes US-Russia relations on rollercoaster ride France and the UK have accused Russia of dragging its feet on the Ukraine peace deal. UK Foreign Minister David Lammy told reporters at a Nato summit in Brussels that the Russian leader \"could accept a ceasefire now, [but] he continues to bombard Ukraine, its civilian population\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Russians knew the American position, \"and we will know from their answers very soon whether they are serious about proceeding with real peace or whether it is a delay tactic\". Kryvyi Rih is about 40 miles (70km) from the front line in eastern Ukraine and with a population of 600,000 it is reputed to be the longest city in Europe.

        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: New mum Grace (left) and her sister Amy (right) talk about the \"miracle\" of baby Amy A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb. The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 â in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant. Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb. Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says. \"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\" Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb. The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\". The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial. This video can not be played Surgeons on \"magical moment\" womb transplant child was born Baby Amy is the first child born in the UK to a woman who has had a womb transplant Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable. The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.  Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\". \"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\" Womb transplants: how do they work? The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born. Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic. When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace. Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\" Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF. It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\". Grace holds baby Amy with her husband Angus at her bedside. They are surrounded by smiling medics at the Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.  \"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga. Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right. The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed. Grace delivered her baby under the care of the maternity team at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, in London Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades. He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy. \"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day. \"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds. He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb. Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, external, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free. He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around Â£30,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more. The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant, external told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations. Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says. The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team. For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister. \"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "title": "Donald Trump threatens new 50% tariffs on China",
        "content": "Donald Trump has threatened China with an extra 50% tariff on goods imported into the US if it does not withdraw its 34% counter-tariff, as global markets continue to fall. Beijing retaliated on Sunday, following last week's decision by Trump to slap a 34% tax on Chinese imports as part of his \"Liberation Day\" that set a minimum 10% levy on nearly all of America's trading partners. In a social media post on Monday, Trump gave China until Tuesday to scrap its countermeasure or face the 50% tax. China's commerce ministry labelled the additional levy as \"a mistake on top of a mistake\" saying it will never accept the \"blackmail nature\" of the US. If Trump acts on his threat, US companies could face a total rate of 104% on Chinese imports- as it comes on top of 20% tariffs already put in place in March and the 34% announced last week. There are fears that this could deepen a trade war between the world's two biggest economies and global rivals. FOLLOW: Trump tariff live updates Is the world heading into recession? How do share price falls affect me? What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? In his post on Truth Social, Trump also warned that \"all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us [on tariffs] will be terminated!\" Also on Monday, the US president said he was not considering a pause on the global import tariffs to allow for negotiations with other countries. \"We're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and there are going to be fair deals,\" he said. Trump said China had introduced its countermeasure \"despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs... will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs\".  Beijing shot back, saying that \"pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage\". \"The US hegemonic move in the name of 'reciprocity' serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules,\" Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said in a statement.  \"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"  Speaking from the White House, the US president said there could be both permanent tariffs and negotiations. \"We have $36tn (Â£28tn) debt for a reason,\" he said, adding that the US would be talking to China among other countries to make a \"fair deal and a good deal\". \"It's now America first,\" Trump said. This video can not be played Watch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch The tariffs would come as a major blow to China's manufacturers, for whom the US is a key market for exports. China's top exports to the US include electrical products and other machinery, computers, furniture, toys, vehicles and equipment. The US's top exports to China are oilseeds and grains, as well aircraft, machinery and pharmaceuticals. Uncertainty around the tariffs led to a turbulent day on global stock markets. Markets worldwide have plunged since Trump announced the global tariffs.  The value of US stock markets dropped sharply again on opening on Monday, although they later pared those losses, while Europe's biggest markets, including London's FTSE 100, closed more than 4% down. Asian share indexes had nosedived on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling by more than 13%, its biggest one-day fall since 1997. However, most major markets made gains on Tuesday with some notable exceptions. The key index in mainland China was broadly flat on Tuesday morning but there were more losses in Taiwan and Singapore. After being closed for national holidays, Thailand and Indonesia also saw stocks fall by more than 4% and 9% respectively.  A cargo ship at the Qianwan Container Terminal in Qingdao, China Trump's post on Monday also indicated that negotiations on countries' tariff rates would \"begin taking place immediately\". Trump met Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, on Monday in the White House. Netanyahu said that his country would eliminate the trade imbalance with the US, which he said was the \"right thing to do\". \"We intend to do it very quickly... and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers.\" Israel faces a 17% tariff from April 9 under Trump's \"Liberation Day\" policy. The US president also posted earlier, external that Japan was sending a negotiation team to discuss tariffs. And Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, offered Trump a \"zero-for-zero tariff\" deal - although she previously said that she had not ruled out retaliation.  \"We are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,\" she said. Trump said later that the EU had been formed \"to really do damage to the United States and trade\".

        "content": "An individual was seen walking across the nest during the live stream A live stream of a peregrine falcon nest on top of a cathedral has been taken offline after reports the birds' eggs were deliberately smashed. The birds, Alban and Boudica, first nested on the roof of St Albans Cathedral in 2022 and a popular online video stream was launched the following year. At about 10:30 BST the feed was shut down after an individual was seen walking across the nest destroying the eggs.  The Very Revd Jo Kelly Moore, the Dean of St Albans, said: \"We are so desperately sad at the harm done to eggs in our peregrine falcon nest here in the tower at St Albans Cathedral.\" Hertfordshire Police said it was investigating the incident. The live camera feed is a project run by St Albans Cathedral in partnership with Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. In a post on Facebook the cathedral said: \"We are currently working with the Rural Operational Support Team at Hertfordshire Constabulary, and a person is assisting the police with their inquiries.  \"The live cam will remain offline until further notice.\" The live feed was deactivated after the incident at about 10:30 BST Last year 519,882 people viewed the live feed, the most popular day was 9 May when 12,598 tuned in to see three newly hatched chicks. A BBC Three Counties Radio listener named Beverley told presenter Roberto Perrone that she \"felt sick\" as she watched the incident happen on the live stream. She recalled: \"The female bird was sitting on the egg and all of a sudden there was a noise that spooked her, it sounded like a door opening. \"Then I saw a man's leg enter in front of the camera. He stood there for 30 or 40 seconds before literally walking across - he didn't stamp but he stepped on the eggs and just kept walking.\" More than half a million people watched the falcons last year on the St Albans Cathedral's website Peregrine falcons remain loyal to their nest site, which means the cathedral is now an established breeding ground. This year the pair had laid three eggs in the shingle nesting tray which replicates their natural clifftop nesting habitat. The Very Revd Jo Kelly Moore said: \"We are very grateful for the support offered at this time to resolve what has taken place.\" ChloÃ« Edwards, the director of nature recovery at Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust, said the charity was \"saddened\" by the news. She added: \"Peregrine falcons have full legal protection under the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and we welcome the efforts of all those involved in thoroughly investigating this incident to uphold the law and safeguard these remarkable birds.\" Peregrine eggs crushed at St Albans Cathedral Do you have a story suggestion for Beds, Herts & Bucks?

        "title": "King and Queen's new wedding anniversary photos in Italy",
        "content": "The King and Queen will celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary on Wednesday King Charles and Queen Camilla have released new photographs to mark their 20th wedding anniversary later this week, with the couple smiling and looking relaxed in images taken soon after they arrived in Italy for a state visit. They posed for pictures in the gardens of the Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence in Rome, with the Queen wearing a lily of the valley brooch, a symbol of enduring love. Ambassador Lord Llewellyn said the trip came at an \"historic\" moment and such soft power royal visits could have an \"intangible but priceless\" impact. In a time of international uncertainty, the visit is part of the UK's post-Brexit \"reset\" in reinforcing links with European allies. The photographs were taken on the first day of a four day State Visit \"This state visit comes at a key moment,\" said Lord Llewellyn, \"as we reset our relations with our European partners\". There had already been reports of \"royal fever\" and the Italian public valued the King and Queen's enthusiasm for their history, culture and cooking, said Lord Llewellyn, speaking to reporters ahead of the visit. \"Their love for Italy... and all things Italian resonate deeply here,\" said the ambassador, predicting a warm welcome ahead of the trip to Rome and the historic city of Ravenna. The state visit was originally intended to include the Vatican, where the King had been due to attend a service in the Sistine Chapel, but that had been postponed because of the ill-health of Pope Francis. The Pope seems to be recovering, appearing in St Peter's Square at the weekend, but so far there are no plans for a private meeting, although there has been speculation a meeting would appeal to both sides if possible. They met dignitaries at the beginning of the trip, due to last four days State visits, carried out on behalf of the UK government, are an eclectic mix of elaborate ceremony, charming the crowds, flying the flag for business, trying local food and addressing serious international diplomacy. It will be pizza, pasta and policy. The visit comes at a time of economic and diplomatic upheaval from US President Donald Trump - and accompanying the King is the UK's Foreign Secretary, David Lammy. There will be an emphasis on the UK's closer military ties with Italy, which Lord Llewellyn said was \"vital in a changing Europe, as both our countries stand steadfast in our support for Ukraine\". Italy is also the UK's ninth biggest trading partner - and a popular tourist destination, with Rome's historic sights currently overflowing with holidaymakers. There was a nod to Canada too in the ambassador's comments, saying that a trip to Ravenna would reflect that King Charles was also King of Canada, with tributes to be paid to Canadian forces who helped to liberate Italy 80 years ago during the Second World War. The King has had a complicated diplomatic balancing act, as head of state of both the UK and Canada, at a time when Canada has been put under great pressure by the Trump administration. Scottish whisky producers, worrying about US tariffs, might also welcome a plug for their produce at a food festival in Ravenna, where it will be paired with parmesan cheese. On Tuesday:  The King and Queen will be welcomed by Italian President Sergio Mattarella and his daughter at his official residence, the Quirinale Palace The Italian air force's aerobatic team, Frecce Tricolori, and the RAF's Red Arrows will hold a joint flypast over Rome  Mattarella and King Charles will hold a private meeting while the Queen will be shown a selection of books on horsemanship The royal couple will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Altare della Patria. Later this week, the royal couple will visit the Colosseum and also learn about Italian slow food.  The King will meet Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, and become the first UK monarch to give a speech to both houses of Italy's parliament. The culture-loving royals will also have visits associated with the writers Dante and Lord Byron. The evening of the King and Queen's wedding anniversary on Wednesday will be spent at the Quirinale Palace for a state banquet. It will be a big personal moment for the couple, but these are also glitzy public events, with celebrities and politicians on the guest list, with a menu that showcases the country's cuisine. Ahead of the trip, there was an Italian dinner at the King's Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, attended by guests including film stars Stanley Tucci and Helen Mirren, and former footballer David Beckham. The state visit is going to be an intensive set of engagements and follows a recent \"bump in the road\" for the King's health. He had a brief stay in hospital after suffering side effects from his cancer treatment, but was well enough to return to a series of engagements last week. Ambassador Lord Llewellyn said he was confident the trip by the royals - described as \"Carlo and Camilla\" in the Italian press - would leave a \"meaningful and broad legacy\". The royal couple's wedding on 9 April 2005 was held at Windsor Guildhall. Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

        "title": "Blondie drummer Clem Burke dies, aged 70",
        "content": "Clem Burke, the drummer for 1970s new wave band Blondie, has died aged 70 following a \"private battle with cancer\", the band's spokesperson hasÂ confirmed to the BBC. Named one of the greatest drummers of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, external, his energetic fills and melodic flourishes elevated UK number one hits like Call Me, The Tide Is High, Atomic and Heart Of Glass - with Burke deftly switching between punk, reggae, disco and hip-hop grooves. In a long and varied career, he also played with Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan, The Ramones, Eurythmics and Take That's Mark Owen. \"Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\" his bandmates said in a tribute posted on Facebook, external. \"His talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable,\" wrote singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein.  \"Beyond his musicianship, Clem was a source of inspiration both on and off the stage. His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.\"  (Left to right) Chris Stein, Debbie Harry and Clem Burke of Blondie, pictured in 2021 Burke was born and raised in New Jersey, and said his earliest memory was \"playing my father's kit along to the Four Seasons\". He gained experience in marching bands and cover groups, before being recruited for Blondie in 1974. From the start, he envisioned his role as something more than a mere time-keeper. \"I always appreciated drummers like Hal Blaine (Phil Spector's go-to session drummer) and Earl Palmer (Little Richard, Fats Domino) who were consummate studio musicians, and had the kind of musicality and versatility that I aspired to,\" he told Mixdown magazine last year, external. \"I wanted to be able to contribute to the song rather than detract.\" The band made their name in New York punk clubs such as CBGB, alongside contemporaries such as Talking Heads, Television, and Patti Smith and released their self-titled debut album in 1976. However, it was 1978's Parallel Lines that made them household names, powered by new wave hits like One Way Or Another and the disco grooves of Heart of Glass. Recording the drum track for Heart Of Glass was a torturous experience, however. Producer Mike Chapman wanted to synchronise Burke's playing to a Roland drum machine - an experimental procedure that led to the drummer playing each of his drums individually, then piecing together the rhythm track over the period of a week. By the end of the session, \"he was ready to kill me,\" Chapman later told the Wall Street Journal., external  Burke's bandmates paid tribute calling him \"the heartbeat of Blondie\" When Stein became critically ill in 1982, Blondie disbanded.  Burke spent the intervening years playing with US rock band The Romantics, and worked with everyone from Pete Townshend and Joan Jett, to Sex Pistol Steve Jones and The Ramones - for whom he adopted the stage name Elvis Ramone. However, he returned to Blondie when they reformed in 1997, and scored his sixth UK number one single with the anthemic Maria. Speaking to BBC News in 2021, Harry said that having Burke back in the band meant their legacy wouldn't be diluted. \"I think a lot of times when bands get back together, they don't have enough of the original musicians,\" she said. \"With Chris and Clem and myself, we had that core, and it really weighed heavily, you know?\" The band have continued to perform and record ever since, and played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2023.  Burke also became involved with a years-long study of the physical and psychological effects of drumming.  That led to the establishment of the Clem Burke Drumming Project in 2008, whose detailed studies showed that drummers can reach the same physical exertion as professional athletes.  As a result, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire in 2011. Burke made his last appearance with Blondie at Northern Ireland's Belsonic festival last summer, still wearing his CBGB t-shirt. \"His influence and contributions have spanned decades and genres, leaving an indelible mark on every project he was a part of,\" wrote Harry and Stein on Facebook. \"We extend our deepest condolences to Clem's family, friends, and fans around the world. His legacy will live on through the tremendous amount of music he created and the countless lives he touched.  \"Godspeed, Dr Burke.\" Trump envoy in Moscow to meet Putin as Russia's Lavrov says 'ready to reach deal' on Ukraine Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Can India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?

        "title": "PM: I'll only sign US tariffs deal if it suits UK",
        "content": "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to only sign a trade deal with the US that is in the UK's \"national interest,\" as he warned about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The prime minister said the import taxes announced by the US president last week - which have prompted economic turbulence across the world - would pose a \"huge challenge for our future\". The UK is hoping to sign an agreement to limit the impact on the UK, which has been hit with a 10% \"baseline\" import duty, with a 25% tariff on British cars. The UK is considering changes to taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal.  UK to relax electric car rules as US tariffs hit Globalisation era has ended, says Treasury minister What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? But speaking during a visit to a Jaguar Land Rover factory in Solihull, Sir Keir sought to reassure the public there would not be a trade deal at any price. \"I will only strike a deal if it's in the national interest,\" he said. \"That's my priority - strength abroad, security and renewal at home,\" he added. The PM was speaking as a trio of US stock markets opened 4.4% to 5% down amid concern about a global recession. Earlier, the government announced it would relax targets for electric and hybrid cars and provide Â£2.3bn to boost electric car take-up and improve charging infrastructure as a \"down payment\" on Britain's industrial future. Sir Keir said the visit to the car factory was a \"statement of intent\" of the government's plans to support the industry, adding: \"these are challenging times, but we have chosen to come here because we are going to back you to the hilt\". He told factory workers the government would \"have your back\" amid a \"rising tide of insecurity\", pledging further announcements in the \"coming days and weeks\" to \"use industrial policy to shelter British business from the storm\". He also announced a joint investment of Â£600m with the Wellcome Trust to improve access to healthcare data to help researchers conduct medical research. The government says it wants to overturn US tariffs as part of a wider \"economic deal\" with the Trump administration.  But the UK has not ruled out retaliating, with officials drawing up a 400-page longlist of US products that could be hit with British import duties, from crude oil to firearms and bourbon whiskey. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) is urging the government not to \"roll over to an aggressive US administration\" by lowering UK food standards as part of any deal. NFU president Tom Bradshaw said: \"With the UK farming sector already under huge strain, with confidence at an all-time low and investment dropping day by day, it cannot deal with another trade deal which sells out domestic food and farming.\" Negotiations also continue on a deal on technology, with Trump's team understood to be pushing to lower the UK's digital services tax, introduced in 2020, which affects global tech giants like Amazon and Meta. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has urged the PM to \"show the White House we have alternatives and end this trade war through strength not timidity\". Meanwhile, the Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith posted on X to accuse Labour of having its industrial strategy \"still stuck on the grid\".  He also said the government had been \"undermining competitiveness with higher taxes and new employment red tape\".

        "title": "Stock markets dive as tariffs spark recession fears",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch Shares in the US stemmed their losses on Monday, as investors clung to hopes that US President Donald Trump would turn from tariffs to trade deals.  The S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest companies in the US, ended the day down about 0.2%, after a wild day of trading that saw shares gyrating from losses to gains in some of the sharpest swings since the Covid-19 pandemic.  The respite came despite Trump escalating his tariff threats against China, as US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he was opening negotiations with Japan, and looking forward to talks with other nations. Trump offered mixed signals, saying he expected some tariffs to be permanent and some to be negotiated.  \"They can both be true,\" he said, while rejecting calls that he delay the import taxes he unveiled on goods from every country in the world last Wednesday. The White House has said more than 50 countries have reached out to discuss trade. \"I believe that sooner or later, we will be at the negotiating table,\" European Union trade official MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said, as the bloc prepared to vote on how to respond. In the days after Trump's announcement, stock markets in the US and in the UK were hit by their worst one-day falls since the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020.  The S&P 500 has seen more than 10% of its value wiped out over three days - a drop almost as steep as the declines seen during the 2008 financial crisis and at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.  The index is now trading at levels seen roughly a year ago, reflecting widespread concerns about the impact of the tariffs on the US and global economies.   \"It is frustrating for investors,\" said Mike Mussio, president of FBB Capital. \"This feels like kind of an unforced error in terms of policy.\" High profile business leaders in the US including Jamie Dimon, Trump-backer Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb have started to speak out amid the market rout. But Trump has doubled down on his strategy. On Monday, he threatened to hit imports from China with an additional 50% tariff, unless Beijing withdraws the retaliatory measures it announced last week.  That would take the tax on Chinese goods coming into the US to at least 104% - as it comes on top of the 34% tariff he announced on goods from China last week, which themselves added to the tariff of at least 20% imposed since January.  China's decision to impose retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the US had already escalated worries about a trade war between the two nations If world leaders are unable to agree terms with Trump, the tariffs may have a destructive effect on economies globally, analysts have warned. \"Fundamentally, investors are worried about a big hit to corporate [profits] and a massive slowdown in economic growth,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. In early trading on Monday, the S&P 500 fell, briefly dropping more than 20% since its most recent peak in February - which would mark a milestone known as a \"bear market\". But a rumour that the White House was considering putting tariffs on hold sent shares surging more than 7% in a matter of minutes. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones indices, said that he had seen few comparable swings in a career spanning more than four decades on Wall Street. \"That's enormous,\" he said. \"There's a lot of uncertainty here and that's what's driving the market.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.9%, but the Nasdaq was roughly flat, up 0.1%. European markets closed lower, with London's FTSE 100 falling 4.4% to 7,702, its lowest level in more than a year.  Shares in Paris and Berlin also dropped, while earlier leading indexes in Asia had plunged in what one analyst described as a \"bloodbath\". The fears weighed on the price of oil which fell more than 4%, before gaining back some ground. Meanwhile, copper, an indicator of economic growth because it is widely used in industry, fell roughly 3%, while the price of gold, which is usually seen as a \"safe\" investment, also dropped.

        "title": "Mum run over trying to get on bus that left early",
        "content": "Helaleh Cheraghmakani was described as \"a wonderful wife and mother\" A mother was run over and killed by a double decker bus she was trying to get on after it left the stop early, an inquest has heard. Helaleh Cheraghmakani, known as Hailey, banged on the door to be let in before falling down and under the bus in Nottingham city centre on the morning of 22 October, when she was due to start a new job at Boots. A collision investigator said it was likely the 34-year-old had been caught by the tyre next to the door as the bus turned left at a junction, causing her to fall. A coroner found the collision was \"unavoidable\" because it was dark and the driver would not have seen Hailey, but her husband said he intended to \"fight for justice\" through the civil courts. Ramin Dehbandi, Hailey's husband, said: \"She was a wonderful wife and mother and I loved her with all my heart. \"To make the incredibly painful situation even worse, our daughter Liana blames me for her mummy not being there, that I am stopping her from coming back, and calls me Daddy Monster. \"She asked me the other day if I would let mummy pick her up one day from nursery and I could not sleep from the sorrow.\" Her husband intends to \"fight for justice\" through the civil courts Hailey was due to start a new job at Boots in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, the inquest was told. She was due to start at 06:00 BST, but the inquest at Nottingham Coroner's Court heard she was running late because she had initially been given the wrong start date. The bus was meant to leave George Street at 06:00, but the driver left 45 seconds early. The inquest heard this was acceptable within Nottingham City Transport's policies, which allow buses to leave stops up to a minute early. CCTV footage showed Hailey running down George Street as she tried to catch up with the bus. The driver, Anthony Watson, had indicated right when he left the bus stop and was still indicating right when he turned left at the junction on to Lower Parliament Street, the inquest heard. In his statement to police, Mr Watson claimed he had indicated left. Hailey left the pavement and stepped into the carriageway as she banged the doors. In his statement, the driver said he had \"heard a bang\" on the side of the bus but \"did not know what what the bang was\". He said he continued to pull out of the junction, but braked when he saw the nearside back wheel going over a person. Hailey was run over in Nottingham city centre The inquest heard Hailey and her husband had been together since they were 18 and were originally from Iran. They moved to the UK in September 2023, shortly after having their daughter, as they wanted to give her a better future. In his statement to police, Mr Dehbandi said there were different practices for catching buses in Iran. \"In Iran, if you run for the bus and wave your hands at the bus they often stop; this was common practice,\" he said. However, the inquest heard it was against Nottingham City Transport's Conditions of Carriage, external to let passengers on once a bus had left the stop. Section 34 states: \"Once buses have closed their doors and the driver has signalled to pull away, the bus will not be able to let you board because the driver is committed to re-joining the main traffic flow.\" Section 28 also states: \"For safety reasons, buses will only stop at recognised bus stops to allow passengers to board.\" Police investigated but decided it was not a criminal matter, and an inquest was therefore held. Assistant coroner Nathanael Hartley concluded Hailey died as a result of a road traffic collision. He found the driver's failure to indicate left did not have an impact on the collision, as Hailey had caught the bus the day before and knew it turned left at the junction. He found the collision was \"unavoidable\" due to the lighting conditions at that time of the morning, and the dark clothing Hailey was wearing, meaning the driver would not have seen her. He said her cause of death was multiple injuries and she died at the scene. Daniel Denton, a solicitor from Hodge Jones & Allen representing Mr Dehbandi, said: \"This is such an unimaginably tragic case that has devastated the lives of my client and his daughter. \"Their loving wife and mother were snatched away from them and we need answers as to how this could have been allowed to happen. \"We will continue our fight for answers and for justice for Helaleh through the civil courts.\" Tell us which stories we should cover in Nottingham Follow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, external, on X, external, or on Instagram, external.

        "content": "Foiled again? Not quite - the wrapping has been recreated in paint, although everything else is real-deal chocolate Chocolatiers have unveiled what they say is the world's largest Cadbury Creme Egg. Funny foodstuffs had seemed to reach their zenith as recently as Friday, when the King had a blow on a carrot whistle. But not to be outdone, Cadbury has since raised the stakes with its oval ambition. Just how big, though, is the colossal confectionery? Well, let's just say you might bite off more than you can chew, and definitely wouldn't want to drop it on your foot. Cadbury proudly states it to be as tall as an emperor penguin, with the poundage of a newborn horse - or, in old money, 3ft (90cm) and 7st 1lbs (45kg).    And what's more, not a bit of the brown behemoth - on display at Birmingham tourist attraction Cadbury World - is fake. It's real chocolate, with real gooey fondant filling and even has the signature touch of the engraved twinkle.  The only bit of the Easter treat that isn't quite legit is the wrapping. It's actually a painted veneer, presumably because there was not a piece of foil large enough, lest a run on crinkly silver lead to stale sarnies.  Terry Collins, who made the egg with fellow chocolatier Dawn Jenks, said nobody \"gets to eat the egg unfortunately\". Although asked whether not even he got to have a little nibble, he confessed to BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I was tempted during creation, I won't lie.\" He said: \"Here at Cadbury World we normally do creations for each season and we were just thinking 'what better way to celebrate Easter than something as iconic as a Creme Egg?' and we figured 'we've got to go [as] massive as we can with it'.\" The pair crafted it by hand over two-and-a-half days. The Easter creation is roughly the height of an emperor penguin, Cadbury says Asked why it was so heavy, Mr Collins said: \"That would be just purely down to the amount of chocolate we used and fondant. \"To actually make the egg we've had to have a mould, which we've got two sides of, and then we have to build up the chocolate by hand to make sure that the egg actually stays intact.\" Ms Jenks said: \"We challenged ourselves to create something unique and memorable this Easter.  \"Replicating the much-loved Cadbury Creme Egg on an extra-large scale was an ambitious project, and it has been so rewarding to see the vision brought to life.\" The egg is on display at Cadbury World's chocolate-making zone until 27 April.

        "title": "Is the world heading into recession?",
        "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Is the US heading into a recession? Three warning signs to watch US President Donald Trump's tariffs have ignited wildfires across global stock markets, but does that mean we are heading for a recession? The first thing to stress is that what happens in the stock market is not the same as what happens in the economy - falling share prices do not always mean economic misery ahead. But sometimes they do. Very large falls in stock market values, like these, mean there has been a fundamental reappraisal of future profits for the companies that make up the stock markets of the world. What markets quite reasonably expect is that increased tariffs will mean that costs will rise and profits will fall. That doesn't mean that a recession is inevitable but the chances are clearly much higher than they were before Trump announced the most severe and wide-ranging tariffs seen in a century. An economy is defined as being in recession when the total of everything we and the government spend or export shrinks for two successive three-month periods. Between October and December last year, the UK economy grew a tiny 0.1% and the latest monthly data showed it shrank by the same amount in January. The first estimate of how the UK economy fared in February will be released this coming Friday.  So, we are a long way off being able to tell whether we have hit that definition. FOLLOW LIVE: Markets continue to fall in tariff turmoil Why Asian markets are seeing such steep falls How do share price falls affect me? What are tariffs and why is Trump using them? However, in the bloodbath of stock market falls, there are some particularly gory and worrying casualties. Banks are often seen as proxies for economies. As one well respected market watcher told me today: \"The thing that made me catch my breath was the fall in the banks.\" HSBC and Standard Chartered - which operate at the intersection of international trade between east and west - were both down more than 10% overnight before recovering some ground. Other warning signs are not on stock markets but commodity exchanges. Copper and oil prices are considered barometers of global economic health. Both have fallen more than 15% since Trump dropped his tariff bombshell. There haven't been many truly global recessions. The 1930s, the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis and the panic around the pandemic are three rare examples of when we saw synchronised downturns in major economies.  It is still considered unlikely that we would see something on that scale this time but the chances of recession in the US, UK and European Union have been significantly upgraded by most economic analysts.

        "title": "Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi: Nigerian police withdraw summons after outcry",
        "content": "The emir was earlier summoned by Nigerian police over an incident which left one person dead Nigerian police have withdrawn a summons issued to one of the country's most respected traditional leaders after it was widely condemned. The emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, is engaged in a tussle for the crown with his cousin Aminu Ado Bayero, who is said to enjoy the support of the national government. Prior to the recent Eid al-Fitr celebration, police in Kano banned the annual horse parade, or durbar, fearing trouble between supporters of the rival claimants. However, Sanusi chose to ride on horseback after Eid prayers, accompanied by local vigilantes. This led to clashes between rival groups which saw one man stabbed to death, prompting the police to order Sanusi to appear at the national police headquarters in the capital, Abuja. However, this prompted an outcry with many Nigerians saying it showed a lack of respect to the emirate, which is one of the oldest institutions in the country. Traditional leaders in Nigeria hold few constitutional powers but are able to exert significant influence as they are seen as custodians of both religion and tradition. In response to the strong reaction against the summons and following the intervention of \"respected stakeholders\", Nigeria's police chief said that officers would instead go to Kano to obtain Sanusi's statement. The emir has not commented on the summons. Sanusi returned to the Kano throne last year after he was ousted in 2020 for \"insubordination'' to the then Kano state government under Abdullahi Ganduje. Sanusi, a former head of Nigeria's central bank, was reappointed by Kano's current Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf last May, and Bayero was sacked after four years as emir. However, some of Bayero's supporters have gone to court, maintaining he is the rightful emir. While Sanusi is living in the emir's official residence, Bayero is residing in one of the emirate's smaller palaces.

        "title": "Algeria blocks flights from Mali after drone row",
        "content": "Mali's Security Minister Gen Daoud Aly Mohammedine on Sunday described the shooting of the drone as the \"result of premeditated hostile action\" Algeria and Mali have each closed their airspace to flights from the other country, as the row over a drone that was shot down close to their common border escalates. On Sunday, without giving evidence, Mali accused its northern neighbour of being a sponsor and exporter of terrorism after Algeria attacked one of its drones last week. Algeria was the first to ban flights to and from Mali, then Mali later said it was doing the same to all Algerian flights \"in reciprocation\". Sunday's strongly worded statement from Mali's foreign ministry had challenged Algeria's earlier explanation that the unmanned surveillance aircraft had violated its airspace. The statement described the downing of the drone as a \"hostile premeditated action\". Algeria described the allegations regarding terrorism as \"lacking in seriousness [and they]... warrant no attention or response\". Mali's armed forces are fighting ethnic Tuareg separatists in the north. They have a stronghold in the town of Tinzaoutin, which straddles the Mali-Algeria border. The shooting down of the drone raised diplomatic tensions, as Mali, along with its allies Niger and Burkina Faso, recalled their ambassadors from Algiers. Last year, the three junta-led countries formed a regional bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, known by its French acronym AES. In their joint statement condemning Algeria, they said the shooting down of the drone \"prevented the neutralisation of a terrorist group that was planning terrorist acts against the AES\". Mali has also summoned the Algerian ambassador in Bamako over the incident, declaring that it would file a complaint with \"international bodies\". It also withdrew from a regional security grouping that includes Algeria. In its response on Monday, Algeria said it noted the Malian and AES statements with \"deep dismay\". It described Mali's allegations as an attempt to divert attention away from its own failures. It also said this was the third violation of its airspace in recent months. \"Due to the repeated violations of our airspace by Mali, the Algerian government has decided to close it to air traffic coming from or to Mali, effective today,\" Algeria's defence ministry said on Monday. Last Wednesday, Algeria acknowledged that it had shot down an \"armed reconnaissance drone\" close to Tinzaoutin saying it had \"penetrated our airspace over a distance of 2km [1.24 miles]\". But the junta in Bamako denied that the drone had violated Algeria's airspace. It said that the aircraft's wreckage was found 9.5km inside its borders. Giving more details on Monday, Algeria said that the aircraft had entered its airspace \"then exited before returning on an attack trajectory\". Mali regularly accuses Algeria of giving shelter to Tuareg armed groups. The north African country once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali and the separatists. Their relations have soured since 2020 after the military took power in Bamako. Algeria recently deployed troops along its borders to prevent the infiltration of militants and weapons from jihadist groups who operate in Mali and other countries in West Africa's Sahel region.

        "content": "This man clung to a car roof in the city's N'djili neighbourhood Torrential rains and floods have killed at least 33 people in Kinshasa - the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo - according to officials. \"The republic will not abandon you,\" President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi promised victims on Monday, saying he had called a government crisis meeting. Desperate residents are trying to flee the floodwaters by wading, swimming or paddling to safety in homemade canoes. The city is home to 17 million people, external and sits on the Congo river, which is one of the biggest in the world and stretches across the country. Flooding is common - the river recently reached its highest level in six decades. Parts of the capital are prone to soil erosion and in recent years the Congolese president has warned that the climate crisis is making flooding worse, external. Many homes in west Kinshasa were swept away following flooding overnight from Friday into Saturday. About half of the city's 26 districts are affected in total, according to the capital's mayor, who says search and rescue teams have been sent out. Worst affected are the city's outskirts as well as some of its poorest neighbourhoods. \"The water has reached 1.5m [4.9ft] high. We have just managed to save ourselves, the rest is trapped in our homes,\" Christophe Bola, who lives in the Ndanu area, told the AFP news agency. Other local residents have told reporters they are angry with the authorities, accusing them of being too slow to react and not sending enough help. This video can not be played The impact of several days of flooding in DR Congoâs capital, Kinshasa. The floods have also left people across much of Kinshasa struggling with water shortages, after water treatment pumps in the city were themselves inundated. The city's busiest road, which connects the centre with the international airport, is impassable, as is some of the motorway that connects the capital to the country's main port, Matadi. At least one tributary leading off the Congo river - the N'djili river - had burst its banks, trapping many residents there, said Deputy President Jacquemain Shabani in a statement on Sunday. It is said to be one of the more polluted rivers which Congolese scientists say contains high levels of faecal matter, external and other waste. Sewage maintenance is poor in many areas of Kinshasa, and there is little evidence of town planning. Last year the government announced plans to tackle this long-standing problem, external. Further heavy downpours are expected in Kinshasa in the coming weeks, as well as in the eastern city of Goma, which was seized by rebel forces earlier this year. The national meteorological agency also warns of heavy rains elsewhere, especially in the north and north-east of the country.

        "title": "Elon Musk's X to clamp down on parody accounts",
        "content": "X is bringing in stricter rules around parody accounts. From 10 April, accounts which impersonate another user or person must use key words such as \"fake\" or \"parody\" at the start of their account names. The platform will also require parody account holders to use different images to the X accounts belonging to those they seek to represent. Some users have complained about confusion caused by parody accounts on the platform, such as those impersonating its owner Elon Musk. \"These changes are designed to help users better understand the unaffiliated nature of PCF accounts and reduce the risk of confusion or impersonation,\" the company said in a post on Saturday, external.  It encouraged affected accounts to update their profiles by the enforcement date. The changes will also apply for fan and commentary accounts, it said. \"Hopefully this includes all the thousands of fake variations of Elon Musk accounts,\"  wrote one user in response to X's post about its policy update. \"About time, I get a fake Elon account contacting me almost once a week,\" wrote another. There are a number of parody accounts for the platform's owner, identifying themselves as impersonations in various ways. Posts viewed by the BBC from Elon Musk parody accounts ranged from memes and jokes, to promoting cryptocurrency and car giveaways. A recent post by one Elon Musk parody account, which has more than one million followers, told users to \"like and comment\" for the chance to win a Tesla. The post has received 428,000 likes and more than 200,000 replies. X rolled out labels for parody accounts in January - building on its rules requiring, external users engaging in impersonation for the purpose of entertainment to identify themselves as such. These, and the platform's blue tick verification system, have been cited as tools to prevent misleading impersonation while allowing speech and discussion. But the effectiveness of such measures have been disputed. The EU said in July 2024 that the blue ticks breached its online content rules, with its \"verified\" blue tick accounts having the potential to \"deceive\" users. Musk called the EU's rules \"misinformation\", in response. Following his takeover in November 2022, the Tesla chief executive said accounts engaging in unlabelled impersonation would be banned. Many parody accounts on X identify their parody nature in brackets at the end of user names, but this is not a fool-proof measure. If a parody account's name is particularly long, and only a shortened version appears in feeds or replies, users can unwittingly duped - especially if the account's image matches that of the real person.

        "title": "Gazan detainees tell BBC of torture by IDF and Israel Prison Service",
        "content": "Warning: This article contains distressing content Palestinian detainees released back to Gaza have told the BBC they were subjected to mistreatment and torture at the hands of Israeli military and prison staff, adding to reports of misconduct within Israel's barracks and jails. One man said he was attacked with chemicals and set alight. \"I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out [on my body],\" said Mohammad Abu Tawileh, a 36-year-old mechanic. We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held under Israel's Unlawful Combatants Law, external, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group. The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks - a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal. Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees. We also asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) if there were any convictions or accusations against the men but they did not respond to that question. In the men's testimony: They each describe being stripped, blindfolded, cuffed and beaten Some also say they were given electric shocks, menaced by dogs, and denied access to medical care Some say they witnessed the deaths of other detainees One says he witnessed sexual abuse Another says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire We have seen reports by a lawyer who visited two of the men in prison, and have spoken to medical staff who treated some of them on their return. The BBC sent a lengthy right of reply letter to the IDF which laid out in detail the men's allegations and their identities. In its statement, the IDF did not respond to any of the specific allegations, but said it \"completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees\". It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be \"examined by the relevant authorities\". It added that others \"were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine\". It continued: \"The IDF takes anyâ¦ actions which contradict its values very seriouslyâ¦ Specific complaints about inappropriate behaviour by detention facility staff or insufficient conditions are forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities and are dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.\" The IPS said it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse described in our investigation, in its prisons. \"[A]s far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" it added. Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said the treatment the men described was \"entirely inconsistent with both international law and Israeli law\", and in some cases would \"meet the threshold of torture\". \"Under international law, the law of armed conflict requires you to treat all detainees humanely,\" he said. \"The obligations relating to the basic needs of detainees are unaffected by any alleged wrongdoing.\" This video can not be played Mohammad Abu Tawileh shows the scars he says were inflicted by IDF soldiers The five Palestinians interviewed in depth were returned earlier this year under the ceasefire deal with Hamas - the group that led the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. They were among about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees exchanged for 33 Israeli hostages, eight dead and 25 living, some of whom have described being abused, starved and threatened by their Hamas captors. Female hostages previously released have detailed physical and sexual assaults in captivity, external. Israel says forensic tests show some of the dead hostages returned in the ceasefire, including children, were killed by Hamas, though the group denies this. The five released Palestinian detainees all described the same pattern - being arrested in Gaza, taken into Israel to be detained first in military barracks before being moved on to prison, and finally released back to Gaza months later. They said they had been abused at every stage of the process. More than a dozen other released detainees, whom the BBC spoke to more briefly as they arrived home in Gaza, also gave accounts of beatings, hunger and disease. These, in turn, align with testimony given by others to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem and the United Nations, which in July detailed reports from returning detainees that they had been stripped naked, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burned with cigarettes, and had dogs set on them.  A further report by UN experts last month, external documented cases of rape and sexual assault, and said using this as a threat was \"standard operating procedure\" for the IDF. Israel responded to say it \"categorically rejects the unfounded allegations\". As Israel does not currently allow international journalists free access to Gaza, our interviews were conducted by phone call and text message, and also in person by our contracted freelancers in the territory. All five men told us their abuse had begun at the moment of their arrest - when they said they had been stripped, blindfolded and beaten. Mechanic Mohammad Abu Tawileh told us he had been tortured for days. He was taken by soldiers to a building not far from the location of his arrest in March 2024, he said, and held in a room - the sole detainee there - for three days of interrogation by troops. Warning: Graphic image below Soldiers mixed chemicals used for cleaning into a pot, he told us, and dunked his head in them. The interrogators then punched him, he said, and he fell to the rubble-strewn floor, injuring his eye. He said they then covered his eye with a cloth, which he said \"worsened his injury\". They also set him alight, he told us. \"They used an air freshener with a lighter to set my back on fire. I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out. It spread from my neck down to my legs. Then, they repeatedly hit me with the bottoms of their rifles, and had sticks with them, which they used to hit and poke me on my sides,\" he said. They then \"continued pouring acid on me. I spent around a day and a half being washed with [it],\" he told us. \"They poured it on my head, and it dripped down my body while I was sitting on the chair.\" Eventually, he said, soldiers poured water on his body, and drove him into Israel where he received medical treatment in hospital, including skin grafts. Mohammad Abu Tawileh's back is covered in red welts Most of his treatment, he said, took place at a field hospital at Sde Teiman barracks, an IDF base near Beersheba in southern Israel. He said he was cuffed naked to a bed and given a nappy instead of access to a toilet. Israeli doctors at this hospital have previously told the BBC shackling patients and forcing them to wear nappies is routine. When the BBC interviewed Mr Abu Tawileh shortly after his release, his back was covered in red welts. The residual pain from his burns still woke him up, he said, and his vision had been affected. The BBC was not able to speak to anyone who witnessed an attack on Mr Abu Tawileh, but a specialist eye doctor who treated him on his return to Gaza confirmed that he had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it. He also said Mr Abu Tawileh's vision was weakening, due to either the chemicals or other trauma. We showed images of his injuries and gave details of his testimony to several UK doctors, who said they appeared consistent with his account, though they noted there were limitations to what they could assess by looking at photos. The BBC gave extensive details of this account to the IDF, giving it five days to investigate. It did not respond directly to Mr Abu Tawileh's allegations but said it took any actions \"which contradict its values very seriously\". It said it would \"examine\" some of the cases, but did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this included Mr Abu Tawileh. A specialist eye doctor in Gaza confirmed Mr Abu Tawileh had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it Others we interviewed also described abuse at the point of arrest. \"They cuffed us and hit us. No-one would give me a drop of water,\" said Abdul Karim Mushtaha, a 33-year-old poultry slaughterhouse worker, who told us he was arrested in November 2023 at an Israeli checkpoint while following evacuation orders with his family. A report filed by a lawyer who later visited Mr Mushtaha noted he had been \"subjected to severe beatings, humiliation, degradation and stripping during his arrest until he was transferred to prison\". Two said they had then been left outside in the cold for hours, and two said Israeli soldiers stole their belongings and money. The BBC gave details of the allegations of theft to the IDF, which described it as \"contrary to the law and IDF values\". It said it would \"thoroughly\" examine the cases if more details were provided. All our interviewees, including Mr Mushtaha, said they were transferred to the Israeli barracks of Sde Teiman, where Mr Abu Tawileh also said he received treatment in its field hospital. One interviewee told us he was mistreated on the way there. He asked for his name not to be published for fear of reprisals, so we are calling him \"Omar\". He said Israeli soldiers stood and spat on him, and others with him, calling them \"sons of pigs\" and \"sons of Sinwar\" - referring to the Hamas leader and architect of the 7 October attacks, killed by Israel five months ago. \"They made us listen to a voice recording that said: 'What you did to our children, we will do to your children',\" said the 33-year-old, who worked for an electrical cable company. Sde Teiman has been the focus of previous serious complaints in the wake of the October 2023 attacks. Several soldiers stationed there were charged in February after they were filmed assaulting a detainee, resulting in his hospitalisation for a torn rectum and a punctured lung. In a separate case, a soldier at the base was sentenced after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza. Our interviewees were initially detained at Sde Teiman, an IDF barracks which has been the centre of serious allegations regarding its treatment of Palestinians Three of the men we spoke to alleged that dogs were used to intimidate detainees at Sde Teiman and other facilities. \"We would get beaten up when they took us from the barracks to the medical clinic or the interrogation room - they'd set [muzzled] dogs on us, tighten our cuffs,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh who was held in general detention in the barracks, as well as being treated there. The BBC asked the IDF to respond to allegations it frequently used dogs to intimidate and attack detainees. It said: \"The use of dogs to harm detainees is prohibited.\" It also said there were \"experienced terrorists considered to be very dangerous among the detainees held in IDF detention facilities\" and that \"in exceptional cases there is extended shackling during their detention\". Several detainees said they had been forced to assume stress positions, including having their arms lifted above their heads for hours. \"We would be sitting on our knees from 5am until 10pm, when it was time to sleep,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh. Hamad al-Dahdouh, another interviewee, said beatings at the barracks \"targeted our heads and sensitive areas like the eyes [and] ears\". The 44-year-old, who worked as a farmer before the war, said he had suffered temporary back and ear damage as a result, and his rib cage had been fractured. The IDF did not respond to this allegation. Hamad al-Dahdouh said he suffered beatings so severe that they fractured his rib cage Mr Dahdouh and some of the other released detainees said electric shocks were also used during interrogations or as punishment. \"The oppression units would bring dogs, sticks and stun guns, they would electrocute and beat us,\" he said. They would be subjected to beatings and intimidation every time they were moved, Mr Abu Tawileh added. During these interrogations they had been accused of links with Hamas, the men added. \"Anyone who was imprisonedâ¦ they said: 'You are a terrorist',\" said Mr Mushtaha. \"They always tried to tell us that we had taken part in 7 October. They all had a grudge. \"I told them: 'If I am Hamas or anyone else, would I be moving through the safe passage? Would I have listened to your calls to leave?'\" This video can not be played Abdul Karim Mushtaha says he was beaten so much that \"blood was pouring\" down his arms and legs He said interrogations would go through the night. \"For three nights, I couldn't sleep because they were torturing me. Our hands were tied and put above our heads for hours, and we weren't wearing anything. Any time you would say 'I'm cold'â¦ they would fill a bucket with cold water, pour it on you and switch on the fan.\" Mr Dahdouh said their interrogators told them that whoever is from Gaza \"is affiliated with terrorist groups\", and when detainees asked if they could challenge this in court they were told there was no time for that. He said he was not given access to a lawyer. The IDF told the BBC: \"Israeli law grants the right to judicial review in a civil district court, legal representation by an attorney, and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.\" \"Omar\" said he was taken for three days of interrogation when he first arrived at Sde Teiman. He said the detainees were dressed in thin overalls and held in a freezing room, with loud speakers playing Israeli music. When the questioning was over, the men said they were led back to the barracks blindfolded. \"We didn't know if night had come or morning had come. You don't see the sun. You don't see anything,\" said Omar. The IDF said it had \"oversight mechanisms\", including closed-circuit cameras, \"to ensure that detention facilities are managed in accordance with IDF orders and the law\". Omar and Mr Mushtaha said they were then transferred to Ketziot prison, where they described a \"welcoming ceremony\" of beatings and other abuse. Omar and Abdul Karim Mushtaha said beatings at Ketziot prison, pictured here in 2011, were severe and food minimal Omar said he witnessed sexual assault at Ketziot. \"They took the clothes off some of the guys and would do shameful actsâ¦ They forced guys to perform sex acts on each other. I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't penetrative sex. He would tell one guy to suck another guy. It was obligatory.\" The BBC did not receive any other reports of this nature, but the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which tracks conditions of Palestinians in Israeli jails, described sexual abuse of detainees held in Ketziot as a \"common occurrence\". This ranged from rape and sexual harassment to the beatings of genitals, it said. The group said that while it had not received testimony of forced sexual acts between detainees, it had been told some had been made to look at each other naked and had been thrown on top of each other naked. A report by B'Tselem has also gathered allegations of sexual violence, including from one prisoner who said guards attempted to rape him with a carrot. The BBC put the allegation that prisoners were forced to perform sexual acts on each other to the Israel Prison Service (IPS). It replied that it was \"not aware\" of the sexual abuse claim or any of the other claims made about treatment and conditions at Ketziot and other prisons that the BBC had gathered. It said: \"IPS is a law enforcement organisation that operates according to the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the state comptroller and many other official critiques. \"All prisoners are detained according to the law. All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. We are not aware of the claims you described and, as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility. \"Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\" Omar said they were also hit with batons at Ketziot prison. \"After we got tortured, I was in pain all night - from my back to my legs. The guys would carry me from my mattress to the toilet. My body, my back, my legs - my whole body was blue from beatings. For nearly two months I couldn't move.\" Mr Mushtaha described having his head slammed into a door, and his genitals hit. \"They would strip us naked. They would Taser us. They would hit us in a sensitive place. They would tell us 'We will castrate you',\" he said. He said beatings were \"meant to break your bones\", and that detainees would sometimes be grouped together and have hot water poured over them. \"The amount of torture was enormous,\" he added. Both he and Omar also described incidents of what they said amounted to medical negligence. \"My hands were all blisters and swollen,\" said Mr Mushtaha. \"If people could have seen my legs they would have said they needed to be amputated from the inflammationâ¦ [Guards] would just tell me to wash my hands and legs with water and soap. \"But how was I meant to do this, when there was only water for one hour a day [between us], and as for soap, every week they would bring [only] a spoon of shampoo,\" he added. Mr Mushtaha said he was told by guards that: \"As long as you have a pulse you are in good shape. As long as you are standing, you're in good shape. When your pulse is gone, we will come to treat you.\" Abdul Karim Mushtaha was infected with scabies on release from prison, a medical report shows A report by a lawyer who visited both Mr Mushtaha and Omar in Ketziot last September said of Mr Mushtaha: \"The prisoner, like the rest of the prisoners, suffers from pain due to boils on his hands, feet and buttocks, and there is no cleanliness and he is not provided with any kind of treatment.\" Mr Mushtaha also provided the BBC with a report compiled by a doctor in Gaza, which confirmed he was still infected with scabies on the day of his release. Omar said detainees were beaten for requesting medical care. The lawyer noted that Omar needed attention for \"pimples spreading on the skin - in the groin and buttocks due to the harsh prison conditions\" including lack of toiletries and polluted water. \"The prisoner says that even when it is his turn to shower he tries to avoid it because the waterâ¦ causes itching and inflammation.\" All the detainees added they had been given limited access to food and water while in detention at various facilities - several reported losing significant amounts of weight. Omar said he lost 30kg (4st 10lb). The lawyer said Omar told him food was \"almost non-existent\" in the first few months, though conditions later \"improved a little\". Mr Mushtaha described food there being left outside their caged compounds for cats and birds to eat from first. Another of our interviewees, Ahmed Abu Seif, said he was taken to a different prison - Megiddo, near the occupied West Bank, after being arrested on his 17th birthday. Ahmed Abu Seif, held in Megiddo prison's youth wing, says he had his toenails pulled out during interrogations He said Israeli authorities would regularly storm their cells there and spray them with tear gas. \"We would feel suffocated and unable to breathe well for four days after each tear gas attack,\" according to Ahmed, who said he had been held in the prison's youth wing. \"There was no consideration of us being children, they treated us like the militants of 7 October.\" During interrogations he had his nails pulled out, he told us. When the BBC filmed him the day after his release, he showed us how several of his toenails were still affected, as well as scars on his hands he said had been caused by handcuffs and dog scratches. The IPS did not respond to this allegation. Two of the men said they had witnessed the deaths of fellow detainees in Sde Teiman and Ketziot - one through beatings, including the use of dogs, and one through medical negligence. The names and dates they gave of the incidents match media reports and accounts from human rights groups. At least 63 Palestinian prisoners - 40 of them from Gaza - have died in Israeli custody since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the BBC. The IPS did not respond to questions about deaths of Palestinians in custody, while the IDF said it was \"aware of cases of detainee deaths, including those who were detained with pre-existing illness or injury resulting from combat\". \"According to procedures, an investigation is opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) into every detainee death,\" it added. The abuse continued right up to the moment they were freed in February, some of the men said. \"On the release day, they treated us brutally. They tightened the handcuffs and when they wanted to make us move they put our hands above our heads and pulled us,\" Mr Mushtaha said. \"They said: 'If you interact with Hamas or work with Hamas, you will be targeted.' They said: 'We will send a missile directly to you.'\" Ahmed, 17, also said conditions worsened after the ceasefire deal was signed in January. \"The soldiers intensified the aggression against us knowing we were getting released soon.\" It was only once the detainees were transferred to the Red Cross bus for transportation back to Gaza that they felt \"safe\", Omar said. Footage showed some being returned in sweatshirts with the Star of David on them and the words: \"We do not forget and we do not forgive\" written in Arabic. An official at Gaza's European Hospital, which assessed the conditions of returned detainees, said skin conditions, including scabies, were common, and medics had observed many cases of \"extreme emaciation and malnutrition\" and \"the physical effects of torture\". Legal expert Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne told us: \"Certainly the use of chemicals to burn the detainee and submerge their head would meet the threshold of torture, as would the use of electric shocks, removal of toenails, and severe beatings. These, or comparable acts, have all been recognised to constitute torture by international bodies,\" as have the use of stress positions and loud music. Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne said several of our interviewees' allegations met the definition of torture The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which conducts interviews with returning detainees, said it could not comment on individuals' conditions due to privacy concerns. It added that it was eager to be granted access to those still detained - something which has not been allowed since the 7 October attacks. \"The ICRC remains deeply concerned about the wellbeing of detainees and emphasises the urgent need for it to resume visits to all places of detention. We continue to request access in bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties,\" it told the BBC. Fifty-nine hostages are still being held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. The ICRC has never been granted access to them in their 18 months in captivity, and their loved ones have grave concerns over their wellbeing. For many of the released Palestinian detainees, returning to Gaza was both a moment of celebration and of despair. Mr Abu Tawileh said his family was shocked by his appearance when he was released, and added he was still affected by his experience. \"I am unable to do anything because of my injury, because my eye hurts, and it tears and feels itchy, and all of the burns on my body feels itchy as well. This is bothering me a lot,\" he said. Teenager Ahmed said he now wants to leave Gaza. \"I want to emigrate because of the things we saw in detention, and because of the mental torture of fearing the bombs falling on our heads. We wished for death but couldn't find it.\" What happened to the Gaza ceasefire?

        "title": "Ely: No charges for police officer after teen e-bike deaths",
        "content": "Kyrees Sullivan and Harvey Evans died in a bike crash in Ely, Cardiff A police officer driving a van which followed two teenagers before they both died in an e-bike crash in Cardiff will not face criminal charges, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has said. The CPS said there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. Malcolm McHaffie, head of its special crime division, said it was decided that \"no criminal charges will be brought against a South Wales Police officer\". The deaths of Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, sparked a riot in the city's Ely suburb. Four admit rioting in Ely as accused appear in court How the deaths of two best friends sparked a riot Riot-hit area needs more investment, locals say Best friends Kyrees and Harvey Evans were riding an electric bike when they fatally crashed on Snowden Road, shortly after 18:00 BST on 22 May 2023. Following the deaths, rumours rapidly spread on social media that the boys had been chased by police before the crash. Cars were set alight and fireworks thrown at police after 100 to 150 people gathered in Ely on the evening of the crash. The disorder continued until the early hours, leaving 15 officers injured and property damaged. More than 40 people have since been charged with a variety of public order offences following the riot, with nine defendants below the age of 18. This video can not be played The deaths of the two teenagers sparked a riot in Ely, Cardiff Former South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner, Alun Michael, had initially insisted that the two teenagers were not being followed by police before they died. But CCTV footage analysed by BBC Verify later showed police were following the boys just minutes before the crash. South Wales Police later said that its officers had been following the boys in the minutes before, and the force referred itself to Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC served the driver of the police van, along with another officer in the vehicle, gross misconduct notices. At the time, the police watchdog said this did not necessarily mean disciplinary proceedings would follow The CPS also announced it was investigating the police officer driving the van for dangerous driving. On Monday, Mr McHaffie, said: \"Following a thorough and detailed review of the evidence in relation to a single allegation of dangerous driving in this case, we have decided that no criminal charges will be brought against a South Wales Police officer. \"We have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.\" The CPS added in its statement that it fully understood that this would be \"disappointing news for the families of both boys\" and would offer a meeting with them to explain their reasoning further. David Ford, director of the IOPC, said the families were informed of the referral to the CPS after it \"thoroughly and carefully\" analysed the evidence which determined there was an indication an officer may have committed a criminal offence related to their driving.  He added that the IOPC acknowledged the CPS's decision and was finalising its stance on potential disciplinary action for the police van driver, with an update to follow once decisions were made. Mr Ford also announced the IOPC's second investigation into family complaints against South Wales Police, which covered a number of areas including the families' treatment at the scene of the incident, was close to finishing.

        "content": "The proposed hotel would feature a spa, health facilities and food and drink spaces A historic Grade I listed building on the north bank of the River Thames could be turned into a luxury 179-room hotel. Custom House, on Lower Thames Street in central London, played a significant role in London's global trading network and was most recently occupied by HMRC before it was vacated in 2021.  A previous application to develop the site was rejected on appeal in 2022 by the Planning Inspectorate, after the City of London Corporation indicated it would have refused the proposal. The new plans submitted to the local authority include a spa and food and drink spaces, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Custom House was bought by real estate company Jastar Capital in 2023 through a subsidiary, Custom House City Ltd. The developer has said it also has a cultural strategy of establishing a \"golden thread\" through key historic spaces including a public ground-floor route through the former King's Warehouse, accompanied by historic displays. A new cafÃ© and a public quayside space are also included along with opening up more of the Thames Path to make accessible to the public all year. Architects Orms said they aimed to envision \"the potential that the revitalisation of the site could achieve by improving the experience of the riverside for all Londoners\" Jay Matharu, from Jastar Capital, said the proposal would \"bring this iconic London landmark back to life\". \"As long-term custodians, we are thrilled to put forward our plans to revitalise Custom House with welcoming community spaces, a heritage-focused hotel, elegant event spaces, exceptional dining experiences, a dedicated spa, and a dynamic quayside,\" he added. Elyse Howell-Price from architectural firm Orms, which has designed the proposed development, said the site was \"a hugely sensitive heritage asset in one of the most significant riverside sites in The City of London\".  She added that in drawing up the plans, the firm investigated the history and construction of the building while \"envisioning the potential that the revitalisation of the site could achieve by improving the experience of the riverside for all Londoners\".

        "title": "Trump tariffs: Why are Asian markets seeing a 'bloodbath'?",
        "content": "Asian economies are particularly sensitive to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the US Asia-Pacific stocks from Shanghai to Tokyo and Sydney to Hong Kong plunged on Monday by levels not seen in decades, as global markets continue to reel from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.   The Shanghai Composite was down more than 8% at one point, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped more than 13% and Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down by 7.8% - moves that one analyst described to the BBC as a \"bloodbath\". European markets too fell in early trading, with banks and defence firms seeing the biggest drops. This follows global slumps last week after Trump announced new tariffs between 10% and 46% on most countries.  This is a blow for Asia's manufacturing hubs that count the US as a key market for exports ranging from clothes to cars.  These include wealthy allies like Japan and South Korea, which face 26% tariffs, as well as developing countries like Vietnam that are bracing for a 46% levy - Trump called the fast-growing economy one of the \"worst offenders\".  Also on that unenviable list are Cambodia (49%), Thailand (36%) and China, which will face 54% tariffs in total.  Others like Singapore, New Zealand and Australia have already had a so-called baseline 10% tariff go into effect.  \"Asia is bearing the brunt of the US tariff hike. While there could be some room for negotiation, a new regime of higher tariffs is here to stay,\" Qian Wang, Asia Pacific chief economist at investment firm Vanguard. Asian economies are also particularly sensitive to fears that a global trade war could trigger a slowdown or even a recession in the US, the world's biggest economy. That, in turn, would further hurt Asian exports.  Slumps in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were exacerbated as investors caught up with the big falls seen in other markets on Friday as they were closed for public holidays. The Shanghai Composite closed 7.3% lower and Taiwan Weighted Index lost 9.7% - its biggest drop on record. The ASX 200 in Australia lost 4.2% and the Kospi in South Korea ended 5.6% lower. The Hang Seng closed 13.2% lower, its biggest drop since 2008.  \"Tariffs are feeding into expectations around inflation and a recession,\" said Julia Lee, head of client coverage at FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group. Goldman Sachs now forecasts there is a 45% chance the US will fall into recession in the next 12 months - up from a previous estimate of 35% - as the investment banking giant lowered its economic growth forecast for the country. Other Wall Street firms have also revised their recession forecasts in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement. JPMorgan now sees a 60% chance of a US and global economic downturn. \"This is negative to the global and Asia economy, especially those small open economies, both in the short term and long-term.\" Countries from Vietnam to Bangladesh have become highly reliant on the US as an export market. Several major US brands produce goods in Vietnam, including Nike and Gap. Bangladesh exports $8.4bn (Â£6.5bn) of garments a year to the US, according to the trade body, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.  So Trump's announcement last week of a 37% tariff on Bangladesh is bad news for the South Asian nation. \"Asia is likely to feel a disproportionate brunt of this turmoil because Asia sends more exports to the US than to other markets,\" said Frank Lavin,  former undersecretary for international trade at the US Department of Commerce. Asia's biggest economy, China, has also hit back with its own tariffs, deepening the global stock market turmoil on Friday. All three major US stock indexes in fell by more than 5%, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020. In the UK, the FTSE 100 plunged almost 5% - its steepest fall in five years, while exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines. Ms Lee also highlighted that the global stock market rout looks set to continue: \"US futures trading lower point to another hard session on Wall Street tonight.\" Global stock markets have lost trillions in value since Trump announced sweeping new 10% import taxes on goods from every country, with products from dozens of countries, including key trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam, facing far higher rates.

        "content": "The imposition of tariffs on the Heard and McDonald islands was meant to close \"ridiculous loopholes\", said the US Commerce Secretary The US Commerce Secretary has defended the country's decision to impose tariffs on a group of uninhabited islands, which are populated only by penguins and seals.  The imposition of tariffs on the Heard and McDonald islands was meant to close \"ridiculous loopholes\" and would prevent other countries from shipping through the islands to reach the US, Howard Lutnick told the BBC's US partner CBS. Authorities in Australia reacted with surprise last week when they found out about the tariffs on the island, which sits 4,000km (2,485 mi) from Australia. Its trade minister Don Farrell told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the tariffs were \"clearly a mistake\" and indicated a \"rushed process\". But when asked about the inclusion of the Australian territory on Trump's tariffs list, Lutnick said: \"If you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.\" \"The President knows that, he's tired of it, and he's going to fix that.\" Lutnick's interview was one of several given by US government officials to defend the president's new tariffs after all three major stock indexes in the US plunged more than 5% on Friday, in the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.

Shipping products through one port to another in a process known as transshipment is common in global trade.

It's difficult to get a clear picture on the imports from the Heard and McDonald islands to the US. According to export data from the World Bank, the islands have, over the past few years, usually exported a small amount of products to the US. It peaked in 2022, when the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.3m; Â£1.1m) from the territory, external, nearly all of it unnamed \"machinery and electrical\" products. Also included on Trump's list was the British Indian Ocean territory, which is solely occupied by military personnel and requires a permit to visit.

        "content": "Jayne Evans is one of hundreds of \"placeholder\" resident doctors who do not know where they will be based Jayne Evans has completed four years at medical school in London - but says she is still being left in the dark about where her first permanent NHS position will be. \"I was told that I don't have a job set aside for me,\" she said. \"They've guaranteed we will only be offered jobs other people decline and there's just no sort of timeline that they can give us.\" Ms Evans has been given a rough idea of where she will be working - the Trent area, which spans almost all of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire - but no further clues. \"They've even admitted it could be three weeks before I start work that I find out what city I'm living in,\" she told the BBC. Ms Evans says working as an epidemiologist during the Covid pandemic inspired her to become a doctor She is one of hundreds of newly qualified medical students who have not been found a specific job by the NHS yet. Instead they have a so-called \"placeholder job\", meaning they have only been told the rough part of the country they will be in. Without knowing where they will be living, they say they are not able to start preparations for moving. It is the second year a new system has been used to allocate foundation jobs for doctors. Previously, students were ranked and jobs were allocated based on merit, but this was changed for fear it was stressful for students and particularly unfair on those from deprived backgrounds and ethnic minorities.  They tended to perform less well, and therefore were more likely to be posted to regions they did not favour, according to the UK Foundation Programme. Instead, jobs are assigned randomly, which means a higher proportion of students are not getting what they asked for. There has also been an increase in the number of medical students applying for jobs after the government opened several new medical schools. Ms Evans said it had overshadowed her achievement in qualifying. \"I was expecting around this time to feel excited or even nervous, but now mostly I just feel angry and disrespected,\" she said. \"I went into medicine and was told we needed doctors and the NHS needs help but I've been told there is no job for me. \"No-one's offered me any sort of clarity or even an apology.\" Dr Hassan Nassar was one of more than 1,000 medical students in the same position last year. The British Medical Association (BMA) estimates that number has dropped to about 700 this year. \"My graduation was one of uncertainty, not excitement,\" recalled the 24-year-old. \"I was assigned to the East Midlands - somewhere in Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland - but didn't know which hospital I'd be in for months, so couldn't plan my life or find a place to live. \"I spent the first four weeks of my job as a doctor in temporary accommodation.\" He said he was lucky he ended up allocated to Leicester, even if it was last minute. \"I had no links to the East Midlands and was so nervous about coming,\" he said. \"But Leicester has welcomed me with open arms. It is such a friendly and brilliant city, I'm lucky that I've been able to make friends and make it work.\" Dr Hassan Nassar says not knowing where he was working until the last minute meant he could not plan his life The BMA, the union that represents doctors and medical students in the UK, has accused the government of failing to plan for an increase in resident doctors - formerly known as junior doctors - after increasing the number of medical school places. \"The government has increased the number of medical school places - but not the number of foundation jobs,\" Callum Williams, the union's deputy chair of education, said. \"The government needs to increase that funding - and these jobs should go to UK-trained doctors first.\" Mr Williams said there was a danger students would move abroad. \"It's your first job with the NHS, it is supposed to be exciting and instead it leaves a sour taste in your mouth,\" he said. \"It's essential that we keep doctors in the NHS - and when this is students' first experience with NHS employment, it increases the risk that they'll join so many of their colleagues in moving abroad.\" The BMA worries resident doctors will leave to work abroad if they have poor experiences with the NHS Research carried out by the BMA found almost a third of current medical students say they intend on working abroad, and close to half of those say they do not plan to return. Ms Evans was born in the US but has lived in the UK since she was 12. She said: \"People hear my accent and say, 'are you American? Are you going back to America?' \"I've been really confident the whole time I've been studying saying I don't want to go back to America. I love it here. \"I want to work for the NHS, I really am passionate about healthcare that is free at the point of access. That really matters to me.\" Now she isn't so sure. She said: \"When I told my family this was happening, I was in the US and they sat down with me and said 'what are you doing? Just come back, because you won't be treated like that here'.\" The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment and referred the BBC to NHS England. An NHS England spokesperson said: \"While record numbers of applicants have received their first choice this year, we appreciate the uncertainty and anxiety that many applicants who have been allocated placeholder posts experience while we finalise their training programme. \"We have reassured those affected that they will receive a place on a training programme with support available from their foundation schools during the wait - we will continue to work closely with foundation schools to get applicants more information about their programmes as soon as possible.\" Are you a new doctor who doesn't know what your job will be?

        "title": "UK to relax electric car sale rules as Donald Trump's tariffs hit",
        "content": "The government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US. A ban selling new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, but manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines.  Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast its changes were not a \"silver bullet\" but part of the solution to responding to US tariffs. UK opposition parties said Labour's measures would not be enough to boost the car industry. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, which is a major export market for the UK motor industry.  It came into force last week and is separate to a 10% tax on nearly all UK products announced by Trump on Wednesday.    A consultation on the government's EV target changes ended in mid-February, but Alexander told the BBC that the government had sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs.  The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously \"strengthen its commitment to the phase out\" while introducing \"practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition\". Currently, 28% of new cars sold in the UK this year must be electric, a target that will rise each year until 2030. But manufacturers will now be given more freedom in how they meet their yearly targets - meaning if they don't sell enough EVs in one year, they can make up for it by selling more the next year, for example. In addition, the fine of Â£15,000 per vehicle sold that does not meet the latest emissions standards will be cut to Â£12,000. Meanwhile, a ban on the sale of hybrid vehicles - which combines a petrol or diesel-powered engine with an electric motor - has been confirmed as from 2035. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline As part of the changes, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Times on Monday that the government is \"putting Â£2.3bn towards tax breaks for people buying electric vehicles and improving charging infrastructure\".  The Treasury later told the BBC this means the government will invest Â£2.3bn in the car industry - all of which was announced in last October's Budget. Live updates as Trump's tariff turmoil deepens Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be? 'Sometimes you have to take medicine': Trump defends plan The ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars was extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government, but Labour promised to restore the 2030 deadline in its manifesto for the 2024 election. Car industry leaders have previously warned that drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and a lack of charging point infrastructure. Sir Keir said the measures would \"boost growth that puts money in working people's pockets\" and ensure \"home-grown firms\" can export UK-made cars worldwide. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the changes are \"very much needed\". However, Robert Forrester, chief executive of car dealership chain Vertu Motors, told the BBC said there were \"lots and lots of words in the announcement but it doesn't really address the major issues\". He said manufacturers will still be paying billions in fines, despite the cut to Â£12,000 per car. \"Nothing has really changed here - this is just tinkering,\" he said, adding: \"The government has gone for hope over reality.\" Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith described the measures as \"half baked\" and repeated Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's claim that \"net zero by 2050 is impossible\". Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson called for \"better incentives\" for consumers to buy electric vehicles, and said the changes \"won't be enough to protect the sector from the impact of Trump's damaging tariffs\". The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union. Coventry-based car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover announced on Saturday that it will \"pause\" all shipments in April to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\". A separate 10% tariff on UK imports came into effect on Saturday, with higher rates in place for some other major economies.

        "content": "Critics says Zimbabwe's president is trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced he will suspend tariffs on goods imported from the US in an attempt to build a \"positive relationship\" with President Donald Trump's administration. The move comes days after Trump imposed 18% tariffs on Zimbabwean exports to the US. \"This measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States,\" Mnangagwa said on X.  Zimbabwe has had strained diplomatic relations with the US since it adopted a controversial land policy about 25 years ago, and because of its poor human rights record.  Trade between the two countries amounted to only $111.6m (Â£86.6m) in 2024, US government data shows, external.  Follow live: Global leaders try to soften tariffs impact   The US exported goods worth $43.8m to Zimbabwe in 2024, up 10.6% from the previous year, while imports were down 41% to  $67.8m. Zimbabwean political analyst Tendai Mbanje told AFP news agency that the decision would not result in substantial economic benefits for Zimbabwe and would would only benefit the US.  Prominent Zimbabwean journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin'ono said  the president appeared to be trying to \"appease\" the Trump administration.  Mnangawa possibly hoped that the administration would lift sanctions imposed on him, but it was a \"long shot\", he added on X.     Trump's tariffs could be death knell for  US-Africa trade pact How jeans and diamonds pushed Lesotho to the top of Trump's tariffs list Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy The US first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's government during the rule of Robert Mugabe after he introduced a land reform programme in 2000 that led to the seizure of white-owned farms, and because of repressive measures taken against the opposition. The Biden administration in the US scrapped the sanctions in 2024, replacing them with targeted sanctions on 11 individuals - including Mnangagwa - for \"democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption\".  Mnangagwa has previously denied the allegations, describing the sanctions as \"illegal and unjustified\".  Announcing his decision to waive tariffs on US imports, he said Zimbabwe's focus was on \"fostering amicable relations with all nations, and cultivating adversarial relationships with none\". \"This action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation,\" he added.  Chin'ono said that Mnangagwa was currently the chairman of the regional bloc Sadc, and should be trying to forge a common response to the US rather than acting unilaterally.  \"When countries face global economic shifts, co-ordinated responses offer better leverage and stability,\" he added.  Lesotho - another southern African state - was hit with 50% tariffs, the highest in the list released by Trump on Wednesday. Its government said it would send a delegation to the US to negotiate a new deal, and it would look for new markets for its goods.  How might tariffs change the price of Nike's iconic trainers?

        "title": "US cancels visas for South Sudanese over deportation dispute",
        "content": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the US is immediately revoking visas issued to all South Sudanese passport holders due to the African nation refusing to accept its citizens who have been removed from the US.  Rubio, in a statement on Saturday, added that the US would also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry. He blamed \"the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner\". A cornerstone of President Donald Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants from the US, with the promise of \"mass deportations\". \"It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States,\" said Rubio.  \"Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them,\" he added. It comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war. On 8 March, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as regional fighting broke out, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018. South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to remain in the US for a set period of time.  TPS for South Sudanese in the US had been due to expire by 3 May. South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. But just two years later, following a rift between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar, the tensions erupted into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented - including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army. Sporadic violence between ethnic and local groups has continued in parts of the country. Since returning to office, the Trump administration has clashed with international governments over deportations of their nationals from the US.   In January, Colombian President Gustavo Petro barred two US military flights carrying deported migrants from landing in his South American country.  Petro relented after Trump promised to place crippling tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. One of the most famous South Sudanese citizens currently in the US is Duke University star basketball player 18-year-old Khaman Maluach. A spokesman for the university said on Sunday the school was \"aware of the announcement... regarding visa holders from South Sudan\". \"We are looking into the situation and working expeditiously to understand any implications for Duke students.\" Maluach, who played for the South Sudanese Olympic basketball team last summer, spent much of his life in Uganda after fleeing his violence in his homeland as a child. The first-year student - whose Duke team was eliminated from the national championship tournament Saturday night after losing in the semi-finals to the University of Houston - is widely expected to join the ranks of the NBA after graduation.

Lee Baker, 48, and his 10-year-old daughter Esme Baker, died at Golden Beach Holiday Park, in Ingoldmells, Skegness on Saturday. They were from the Nottingham area and had been \"excited to be spending the first weekend of the holidays together\", their family said in a tribute. \"We are all utterly devastated at what's happened. This loss is incomprehensible at the moment,\" they added. Drone footage of the park showed the remains of the caravan after the fire on Saturday Lincolnshire Police said it was still awaiting formal identification, which could take some time.   The police and fire service were called to the holiday park at about 03:50 BST on Saturday and said they were working together on the investigation to establish the cause of the blaze.  Senior investigating officer Det Insp Lee Nixon said the intensity of the fire had made the investigation \"incredibly challenging\". \"We are working hard to validate the facts available to us to be able to provide answers for the family and loved ones of those who were very tragically taken by this fire,\" he said.  Dan Moss, area manager for prevention and protection at Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, said: \"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the family at this time.  \"Once investigations are complete, local fire crews and our community fire safety team will be on hand to talk to people in the area and address any fire safety concerns they may have, at what will be an upsetting time.\" Tributes were left at the Golden Beach Holiday Park on Sunday morning In a statement, the owners of the park said: \"On behalf of everyone at Golden Beach Holiday Park we would like to send our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families and friends affected by [Saturday's] tragic events.\" They thanked emergency services for their help and support and asked for \"patience and privacy\" while investigations continued. People laid tributes at the park on Sunday morning. Jack Price, who works as a bingo caller at the Sandancer pub in Ingoldmells, said he knew Mr Baker and Esme well.  \"It's like they were family members, they weren't just customers to us. Everyone behind the bar knew them. It's just unbelievable,\" he said. An online fundraiser set up by the pub for the victims' family described them as \"two peas in a pod\" who were \"both happy-go-lucky people who loved life\". Ruth Dorrin, who donated to the appeal, said: \"It's just so sad and when you've got little ones, it's just heartbreaking. \"You're meant to come on holiday to enjoy yourself, aren't you? It's justâ¦ you can't put into words.\" Another fundraising page set up to support the family said: \"Lee was a hard working plasterer who loved his football and adored his darling daughter. \"Esme was the brightest, funniest, most intelligent, happy little girl who loved to read, colour, dance her little heart out.\"  Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

The line will remain closed on Sunday as it is unsafe to run trains under the bridge, with Network Rail describing the damage as \"significant\". Alterations have been made to the ScotRail timetable and passengers have been urged to check their journeys before travelling. Network Rail said the damage was significant Police Scotland said the driver had left the scene of the crash before officers arrived at about 19:40. A spokesperson for the force said inquiries were ongoing to establish the full circumstances.

        "title": "DIY: Are Britons losing their ability to do it themselves?",
        "content": "Handyman Simon King says people are losing the ability to carry out even the most basic of tasks Are Britons losing their ability to mend, preferring instead to call in a professional at the first sight of a blown fuse? BBC News takes a dive into the issue. Handyman Simon King makes an interesting point, as he holds his well-thumbed copy of Collins Complete DIY Manual, acquired when he bought his first house 30 years ago: \"You don't see comedies on the TV poking fun at DIY mishaps these days, do you?\" If sitcoms loosely mirror life, it is perhaps no wonder that the likes of hapless DIYer Frank Spencer, played by Michael Crawford, no longer draw in prime time audiences. After all, there is not much comedy gold in a professional fixing a kitchen tap without causing a biblical flood, or putting up a shelf - and it staying attached to the wall. \"People just aren't doing as much DIY,\" reports Mr King, offering a view from the coalface. Michael Crawford's character Frank Spencer entertained viewers with his tales of DIY woe Matt Walton, senior analyst at Globaldata, a company that provides insights on various industries, including retail, agrees. He believes the boom period of DIY, seen during the Covid pandemic, has \"been and gone\". \"When people were furloughed they had time on their hands to do jobs around the house,\" he says. \"But we've moved on.\" Mr Walton cites difficulties in getting on the housing ladder as another reason for the DIY malaise. He says: \"We have a lot of people in Britain in rental accommodation. In many cases, they are not permitted to carry out work on properties themselves. \"I also think these skills are just not being passed down to younger generations, as they once were.\" Fewer people are attempting DIY jobs around the house, it is claimed Mr King, 55, who operates out of Lincoln, thinks Britain has lost its \"make do and mend\" culture.  \"My dad was from that era... and I think most people from his generation would at least have had a go at stuff, which is where a lot of the comedy stuff came from when it went wrong.\"  Mr King recalls taking TVs apart \"just to see how they worked\", before screwing them back together.  \"These days, though, they're not designed to be taken apart and there's not really much you can do to repair them without the right diagnostic equipment.\" Many of his customers are homeowners without the skills, confidence, time, or frankly, the inclination, to attempt even the most basic of DIY tasks, he reports. \"Lots of people call me just to put a picture up on the wall. My son said to me once, 'Dad, I can't believe people actually pay you just to do that'.\"  Mr King still refers to his trusty manual. \"I got it when I bought my first house,\" he says. \"I didn't have the money to spend on hiring someone to do the work so I had to learn to do it myself.\" He believes people changing lifestyles has led to a general malaise for DIY home improvements.  \"If you're working that hard, you don't want to spend your weekend doing DIY jobs,\" says Mr King. \"So people will ring up a local handyman instead.\" But while Mr King is happy with the status quo - it is keeping him in work - in East Yorkshire, Alan Dalgairns and his Hull Repair Cafe are working on a fix. Here, people can bring in items, which would ordinarily be thrown out, to be fixed - for free - by experienced DIYers. A charge is only applied for parts needed to carry out repairs. Alan Dalgairns fears younger Britons are not learning basic DIY skills    \"People will sit with our repairers while the work is carried out, in the hope that next time they might feel confident to have a go themselves,\" says Mr Dalgairns, 51.  He also thinks skills are not being passed down family lines. Alongside the cafe, Mr Dalgairns runs Hull Library of Stuff, which loans - for a nominal fee - items ranging from extension ladders to angle grinders and chisel sets. \"A lot of younger ones who come in to borrow equipment don't have a clue how it works,\" he says. \"I'll then spend time showing them how to use the item properly and safely.\" \"I think we are losing those basic skills, and I think it's because younger generations are not seeing their parents carrying out these type of jobs.  \"I am a dad to a 10-year-old who watches me repair stuff but we're probably in a minority. \"I'm very much of the mindset what if something is broken, what is the worst that can happen?\" He recalls watching his parents \"mend and make things\". \"I remember coming home from school one day and finding a new chair. My mum had made it from an old bed. My dad would do all the repairs around the house.\" Mr Dalgairns believes many young people today \"don't have a clue what's inside products\". He says: \"They think stuff works using black magic. But what they don't seem to get is that a lot of time something stops working because of something really simple. That's especially true when it comes to sound systems, for example.\" Mr Dalgairns says some young people are turning to social platforms like YouTube for instructional videos \"usually recorded by older people who know what they're doing\". But he believes nothing beats learning practical skills, hands on, from someone experienced. \"That's why we have set up a kids' club, encouraging children to get under the hood and take things apart,\" he says. Mr Dalgairns explains the organisation has teamed up with Dove House, a local hospice, which runs a re-use shop at a council-run household recycling centre. He says they get electrical items that no longer work and encourage children to take them apart and \"examine the various components\". The club is on a hiatus at the moment, says Mr Dalgairns. \"We're confident it'll return next year.\" Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here, external.

        "content": "The statue was first erected at Euston station in 1871 A Grade II listed statue of railway pioneer Robert Stephenson is to go on show at a museum.  The bronze 8ft 10in (2.7m) statue of the Northumberland-born engineer will be unveiled at the Locomotion museum in Shildon, County Durham, on Tuesday. It was first erected at Euston station in London in 1871 and was on display until 2020 when it was moved into storage due to HS2 works.  Museum head Sarah Price said she hoped the statue would help \"inspire\" the next generation of engineers from the north-east of England. Robert Stephenson and his father George set up the first company in the world to build commercial steam trains. The firm produced Locomotion No 1 in 1825, the first engine to pull a passenger train on a public railway. Stephenson also developed the London and Birmingham railway which opened in 1838 - the first intercity railway into the capital. The statue has been leased to the museum on a 10-year-deal The statue of Stephenson was designed by Italian sculptor Carlo Marochetti in the 19th Century.  It was on display at Euston for 149 years until it was put into storage. Ms Price said the statue had been leased to the museum for 10 years and had been restored ahead of its unveiling to the public again.  \"It will look pretty much brand new,\" she said.  With all the trains on display at the Locomotion museum, Ms Price said it was \"easy to forget\" the \"human endeavour\" behind the feats of engineering.  \"Having a statue of somebody who was so intimately involved in that kind of early story - it's just easier for people to relate to,\" she said.

        "title": "Mental health: Large rise in NI universities' spending since Covid-19",
        "content": "The amount of money Northern Ireland universities are spending on mental health and wellbeing services for students has increased significantly since the Covid-19 pandemic. Figures received via Freedom of Information requests have revealed the amount of money allocated has increased by an average of more than 40% since 2020. That includes the annual amount for salaries, wellbeing services and counselling. Northern Ireland's mental health champion welcomed the increased spending but called for a joined-up approach with statutory services. Professor Siobhan O'Neill said starting university very often coincided with the age at which most common mental disorders first present themselves. She put an increase in the recorded rates of poor mental health in students down to \"increased financial and social pressure\" as well as a \"reduced stigma and a willingness to ask for help\". \"International students, and those from marginalised communities such as students from black and ethnic minority groups, disabled students and LGBT+ students are at higher risk,\" she added. New mental health champion to 'challenge Stormont' Will a mental health champion make a difference? Ms O'Neill said the increased spending on mental health services \"reflects a recognition of the importance of providing timely access to mental health support to students who are struggling, so that students can fully benefit from higher education, and reduce the risk of dropout\". However, the mental health champion said this support needed to be accompanied by improvements in statutory mental health services. \"For example, a project linking university and statutory services in the Belfast Trust has been very effective, but it needs to be available in other areas of Northern Ireland.\" St Mary's University College, Belfast has seen the biggest increase with an 85.5% rise in spending from Â£124,927 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£231,691 in 2023/24. It said it had also received double its additional funding from the Department for the Economy's Step-Up Project with Â£50,000 in 2023/24 rising to Â£100,000 in 2024/25. This funding, a university spokesperson added, had been used to support the wellbeing of students using one-to-one mentor support and counselling services. Student mental health risk linked to area of study NI students' mental health 'left in the shadows' Stranmillis University College saw a 62% rise over the five years from Â£55,043 in 2020 to Â£89,208 in 2024. It said it operated a free and confidential, permanently-staffed student counselling service and had a qualified occupational health nurse on site. \"College staff operate an 'open door' policy where students are encouraged to make contact and to discuss issues of concern to them,\" the university added. The amount of spending on mental health services at Queen's University Belfast saw a 52% jump from Â£931,615 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£1,417,539 in 2023/24. The university added that there was a wide range of embedded mental health events and initiatives across the academic year for students. Ulster University's spending on mental health services increased 32% from Â£1,916,528 in the 2019/20 academic year to Â£2,535,553 in 2023/24. It said the university promoted positive mental health and wellbeing initiatives to all pupils via its student wellbeing team, and offered them access to an external counselling provider. Dara Doyle thinks young men can be reluctant to admit they are struggling with their mental health Dara Doyle, 21, a third year psychology student at Queen's University Belfast, said he first reached out for help in 2023. \"I wasn't able to cope with the pressure of the work that was on me,\" he said. \"I was working part time and quite long hours away from the university and I was having a lot of social isolation. I wasn't feeling myself and knew I needed to talk to someone to make a plan to get back to being myself.\" Dara said he accessed a drop-in service and was then offered six sessions of counselling as well as semi-regular check-ups with his wellbeing support officer. He felt there was still a reluctance among young men to speak about their mental health. \"They are trying to seem strong and hold everything together. There is a social judgement when you speak out and say 'look, I'm actually struggling'.\" Caroline Young hopes wellbeing support can help students learn to mange thei Caroline Young, the vice president for students and corporate services at Queen's University Belfast, said since the pandemic there has been \"a significant change in the support that's needed for the young people\". Some feel anxious about the change to university life, she said, while others have \"potentially much more significant pre-existing conditions, or situations\". Queen's offers online help, a daily drop-in service and one-to one counselling. \"I don't expect it to go away,\" she said.  \"What we hope to be able to do is to ensure that there are lots of ways students can understand how to deal with and support their own well-being.\" Studentsâ mental health âworse since Covidâ Poor mental health affects almost half of UK students 'The law must catch up on student mental health' Trump envoy in Moscow to meet Putin as Russia's Lavrov says 'ready to reach deal' on Ukraine Ukraine may have to give up land for peace - Kyiv Mayor Klitschko Post Office paid Â£600m to continue using Horizon Can India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?

        "title": "Why men are so unhealthy - and what can be done",
        "content": "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health â and what can be done about it? Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms. \"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\" The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health â a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.  In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure. These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75, external with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents. Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously. He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\" He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\" He says there are biological reasons â the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services. Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally â many go years without seeing a health professional. \"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\" This video can not be played Dr Xand van Tulleken on why more men should go to the doctor's - subtitled version here Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy. \"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\" But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest â a larger gap than is seen for women â and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75. \"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\" NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer. \"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\" NHS health checks are offered to the over 40s every five years and include blood pressure checks Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates. But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work. He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men. Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs. \"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them â they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White. Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes. But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\" He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players. Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities. \"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\" Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes. The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects. Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations â something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 â that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government. But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.  \"Look at your waist size â if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people. \"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\" UK will have men's health strategy, government says Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Video, 00:02:51Men's Sheds group 'gave a sense of purpose' Are we ready for the new male contraceptives?

2025-04-25 10:26:24.871427 | Q: 봐 | A: Helaleh Cheraghmakani, a 34-year-old mother known as Hailey, was fatally struck by a double-decker bus in Nottingham while trying to board it on October 22, 2023. The bus left the stop 45 seconds early, and Hailey, who was late for her new job at Boots, banged on the door before falling under the bus as it turned left. An inquest concluded that the collision was "unavoidable" due to poor lighting and her dark clothing, which prevented the driver from seeing her. Her husband, Ramin Dehbandi, expressed deep sorrow and plans to seek justice through civil courts, highlighting the emotional impact on their daughter, who blames him for her mother's absence. The inquest found no criminal wrongdoing, and the driver claimed he did not see Hailey before the accident. | Sources: ['https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2ygk5vlpxo']
2025-04-25 10:26:29.905494 | Q: 한국말 해봐 | A: Asian economies are experiencing significant market declines due to fears of a global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump's new tariffs, which range from 10% to 46% on various countries. Major stock indices across Asia, including the Shanghai Composite, Hang Seng, and Nikkei 225, saw their largest drops in decades, with Hong Kong's market plummeting over 13%. The tariffs are particularly damaging to Asia's manufacturing sectors, heavily reliant on US exports, affecting countries like Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. Analysts warn that the heightened tariffs could lead to inflation and a potential recession in the US, which would further harm Asian economies. Global markets have lost trillions in value since the tariff announcements, with predictions of continued volatility. | Sources: ['https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c934qzd094wo']
